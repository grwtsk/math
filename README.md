# GRWTSK mathematics

A Lean library of mathematical definitions, proofs, counterexamples and explicit open problems. The formal sources live in `GRWTSK/`, with `GRWTSK.lean` as the library entry point.

Build with the pinned Lean and Mathlib dependencies:

```sh
lake build --wfail
```

The committed `lean-toolchain` and `lake-manifest.json` pin Lean 4.33.0 and Mathlib revision `db584cd6d46c92f209a44c0f1c829460d327499d`.

Browse the [mathematical subjects](docs/index.md), follow the [least-prime tutorial](docs/start/least-prime.md), or consult the [selected result catalog](docs/reference/results.md). Object guides state exact hypotheses and distinguish formal proofs, conditional results, written arguments, historical checks and open obligations. A successful build does not settle the Riemann hypothesis or the open Möbius cross-energy bound.

Local contributions use the [MIT license](LICENSE); retained upstream terms and individual credit appear in [NOTICE](NOTICE), [LICENSES](LICENSES) and source headers. Repository process records and tooling live in `.noeaaeue/`.
