## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f67d3f37-9bae-0c05-bed9-e831b1306d38`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 167–182.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem boundary_generator_eq_attachingClass
    (I : SingleHandleRelativeInvariant R index) :
    letI := I.carrierAddCommGroup index
    letI := I.boundaryTargetAddCommGroup
    I.boundary I.generator = I.attachingClass :=
  I.boundary_generator

end SingleHandleRelativeInvariant

/--
One certified framed surgery and its handle trace.

The dimension equation expresses `n = p + q`, while `q_pos` makes the belt
sphere dimension `q - 1` meaningful.  No global smooth construction is
derived: `trace` and its relative-boundary property are supplied evidence.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/CommutativeAlgebra/CoreNamespacedSmoothFramedSurgeryTheory.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Core/Varianta0788c80c7a60804a7a22fb187473f15883e115c34d18a7afdb5c9079e3ee9f3.lean#L167).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
