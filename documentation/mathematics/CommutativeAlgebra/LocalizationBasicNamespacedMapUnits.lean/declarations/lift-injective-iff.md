## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e9ab2f24-7dd9-3f6d-2ce7-072f823f4958`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 601–621.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lift_injective_iff :
    Injective (lift hg : S → P) ↔ ∀ x y, algebraMap R S x = algebraMap R S y ↔ g x = g y :=
  (toLocalizationMap M S).lift_injective_iff hg
#align is_localization.lift_injective_iff IsLocalization.lift_injective_iff

section Map

variable {T : Submonoid P} {Q : Type*} [CommSemiring Q] (hy : M ≤ T.comap g)

variable [Algebra P Q] [IsLocalization T Q]

section

variable (Q)

/-- Map a homomorphism `g : R →+* P` to `S →+* Q`, where `S` and `Q` are
localizations of `R` and `P` at `M` and `T` respectively,
such that `g(M) ⊆ T`.

We send `z : S` to `algebraMap P Q (g x) * (algebraMap P Q (g y))⁻¹`, where
`(x, y) : R × M` are such that `z = f x * (f y)⁻¹`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/CommutativeAlgebra/LocalizationBasicNamespacedMapUnits.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant53e3f88a00de6732eb96f79faf6b987880eb262e2a920419a4b41f56e9d47b16.lean#L601).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4da5b6d47c3876f116cd987bc20d6045e1de7d55` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
