## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b1d67ab7cffba8be73bcb8486dccba000c3c7cc2a5f91d9fb66610f1f7b54dbb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 166–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def intValuation : Valuation R ℤₘ₀ where
  toFun := v.intValuationDef
  map_zero' := intValuation.map_zero' v
  map_one' := intValuation.map_one' v
  map_mul' := intValuation.map_mul' v
  map_add_le_max' := intValuation.map_add_le_max' v

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/CommutativeAlgebra/AdicValuationIntValuationDefZero.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/AdicValuation/Variante6cda802d0882d5d4fc4f4856b92b382d18b7962e9d27c8d23b92716e39ff80b.lean#L166).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `832efdce7053f304164f3c839e771c8d8626427a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
