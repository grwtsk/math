## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8221376761db37c27bbe1c73526cab90dde8983d00a559f9773c75403305616f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 153–164.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def equiv : A ⊗[R] R[X] ≃ A[X] where
  toFun := toFunAlgHom R A
  invFun := invFun R A
  left_inv := left_inv R A
  right_inv := right_inv R A

end PolyEquivTensor

open PolyEquivTensor

/-- The `R`-algebra isomorphism `A[X] ≃ₐ[R] (A ⊗[R] R[X])`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/CommutativeAlgebra/RingTheoryPolynomialAlgebraPolynomialAlgebraSourceEdition1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/PolynomialAlgebra/Variant61d4003e2ccf9a6d8412b35ce3b7862750bf43397b9b4645b6bd6acfb597e052.lean#L153).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cd69b09056803b3d6e7cbdc8a3c093297c53e6a6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
