## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b2d3bca1-bfaa-e60d-27d0-9aa564478322`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 200–209.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coeff_hermite (n k : ℕ) :
    coeff (hermite n) k =
      if Even (n + k) then (-1 : ℤ) ^ ((n - k) / 2) * (n - k - 1)‼ * Nat.choose n k else 0 := by
  split_ifs with h
  · exact coeff_hermite_of_even_add h
  · exact coeff_hermite_of_odd_add (Nat.not_even_iff_odd.1 h)

end CoeffExplicit

end Polynomial
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/CommutativeAlgebra/ArithmeticRingsAndOtherSpecialCommutativeRings/PolynomialRingsAndIdealsRingsOfIntegerValuedPolynomials/HermiteBasicNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variantbfddf95890c4703e65c00d16691784c2b724aa44a80bae1860d82e2cde3bdb41.lean#L200).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ef1eb2aa739295c3bc4db5902df0af1ed27c1f6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
