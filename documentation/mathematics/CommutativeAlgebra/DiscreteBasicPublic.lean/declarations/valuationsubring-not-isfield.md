## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f83c4aa0-79a3-636d-2a07-cd594e5f7b6f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 399–408.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem valuationSubring_not_isField [Nontrivial (valueGroup (.ofClass v))]
    [IsCyclic (valueGroup (.ofClass v))] : ¬ IsField K₀ := by
  obtain ⟨π, hπ⟩ := exists_isUniformizer_of_isCyclic_of_nontrivial v
  rintro ⟨-, -, h⟩
  have := hπ.ne_zero
  simp only [ne_eq, Subring.coe_eq_zero_iff] at this
  specialize h this
  rw [← isUnit_iff_exists_inv] at h
  exact hπ.not_isUnit h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/CommutativeAlgebra/DiscreteBasicPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant56536e709daf5b64965fc476e3bb7e47e84b9dcb9d100f04bf36de045a19128c.lean#L399).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7af84f7a1a36036fbf18bc04ace2360fb5422cd9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
