## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b823f611-c2ce-6f7a-52ac-e39849e3101f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 792–804.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem single_pow (a : Γ) (n : ℕ) (r : R) : single a r ^ n = single (n • a) (r ^ n) := by
  induction n with
  | zero => ext; simp only [pow_zero, coeff_one, zero_smul, coeff_single]
  | succ n IH => rw [pow_succ, pow_succ, IH, single_mul_single, succ_nsmul]

end Semiring

section NonAssocSemiring

variable [NonAssocSemiring R]

/-- `C a` is the constant Hahn Series `a`. `C` is provided as a ring homomorphism. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/CommutativeAlgebra/MultiplicationNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RingTheory/Multiplication/Variant6cfee3b41dd0fe36dfc26db565750311fe97808ac57ea367ca9bacff440045e2.lean#L792).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5ca27e0f35af81586b042c3765c44f16d309d137` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
