## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e6097419-c927-5c2d-8738-e644f65e1e7c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 168–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pairedQuadratic_of_dvd (p : ℕ) [NeZero p] (n : ℕ) (h : p ∣ n) (X : ℂ) :
    pairedQuadratic p n X = (X - 1) ^ 2 := by
  simp [pairedQuadratic, (phase_eq_one_iff p n).mpr h, pow_two]

/-- The finite geometric-sum identity, proved without a Fourier inversion assumption. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/Geometry/ModularBoundaryNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/ModularBoundary/Variant7ba15359c9688b571dfc3663006fb60853bfdbfdff10ff8a0eb3845df8703a9c.lean#L168).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c09a97e4c967d0cd23068ce402bab3cdda1fa8ea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
