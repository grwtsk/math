## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5034e894-bc51-7e98-bd36-06e94046f4fe`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 870–875.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem controlled_of_uniformEmbedding [PseudoMetricSpace β] {f : α → β} (h : UniformEmbedding f) :
    (∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ {a b : α}, dist a b < δ → dist (f a) (f b) < ε) ∧
      ∀ δ > 0, ∃ ε > 0, ∀ {a b : α}, dist (f a) (f b) < ε → dist a b < δ :=
  ⟨uniformContinuous_iff.1 h.uniformContinuous, (uniformEmbedding_iff.1 h).2.2⟩
#align metric.controlled_of_uniform_embedding Metric.controlled_of_uniformEmbedding

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GeneralTopology/MetricSpaceBasicNamespacedSourceEdition1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant06b423f09ff5de6236a24088ad540b6f30950ea655e4c0dc8da71419ee2cf286.lean#L870).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5ba8c647f38ac8be65be37d8efb559c9d2788fca` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
