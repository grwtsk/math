## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2ca2756a242d106ef2cec9212fc3a296d7b73839c1b0239f2e75502900302e8f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1009–1026.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def disjointUnion (e e' : PartialHomeomorph X Y) [∀ x, Decidable (x ∈ e.source)]
    [∀ y, Decidable (y ∈ e.target)] (Hs : Disjoint e.source e'.source)
    (Ht : Disjoint e.target e'.target) : PartialHomeomorph X Y :=
  (e.piecewise e' e.source e.target e.isImage_source_target
        (e'.isImage_source_target_of_disjoint e Hs.symm Ht.symm)
        (by rw [e.open_source.inter_frontier_eq, (Hs.symm.frontier_right e'.open_source).inter_eq])
        (by
          rw [e.open_source.inter_frontier_eq]
          exact eqOn_empty _ _)).replaceEquiv
    (e.toPartialEquiv.disjointUnion e'.toPartialEquiv Hs Ht)
    (PartialEquiv.disjointUnion_eq_piecewise _ _ _ _).symm

end Piecewise

section Continuity

/-- Continuity within a set at a point can be read under right composition with a local
homeomorphism, if the point is in its target -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GeneralTopology/PartialHomeomorphNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PartialHomeomorph/Variant2d9aea68ac608ba2c220e6db2dbec0ff6e9974bafdd6dff66c2fb9037d0e51a9.lean#L1009).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cd07fefc073617e1b552badfad718ee1d041de7f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
