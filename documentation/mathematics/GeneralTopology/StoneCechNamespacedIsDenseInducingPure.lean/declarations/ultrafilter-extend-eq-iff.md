## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f430be84-306c-a8ff-75e5-69424aa1be3c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 207–234.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ultrafilter_extend_eq_iff {f : α → γ} {b : Ultrafilter α} {c : γ} :
    Ultrafilter.extend f b = c ↔ ↑(b.map f) ≤ 𝓝 c :=
  ⟨fun h ↦ by
     -- Write b as an ultrafilter limit of pure ultrafilters, and use
     -- the facts that ultrafilter.extend is a continuous extension of f.
     let b' : Ultrafilter (Ultrafilter α) := b.map pure
     have t : ↑b' ≤ 𝓝 b := ultrafilter_converges_iff.mpr (bind_pure _).symm
     rw [← h]
     have := (continuous_ultrafilter_extend f).tendsto b
     refine le_trans ?_ (le_trans (map_mono t) this)
     change _ ≤ map (Ultrafilter.extend f ∘ pure) ↑b

   fun h ↦
    let _ : TopologicalSpace α := ⊥

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GeneralTopology/StoneCechNamespacedIsDenseInducingPure.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/StoneCech/Variant94b4b6022e31e1162d2b8c2f68b23bf0120b9054bef114b62ffd8842263fae70.lean#L207).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ea428a12b0c1a513c2275631d0c002d000e39fd2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
