## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8e79a1c0-7a97-f288-1bf9-732e075a6b5c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 173–181.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem curve_clock (D : Rectangle) {n : ℕ} {a : ℕ → ℝ} (h : Admissible n a) (u : I) :
    curve D n a u = point D (RealPolygonClock.clock n a u) := by
  apply natural (RealPolygonClock.vertex a) (constantVertex (fun i => point D (a i))) n
    (fun i _ => RealPolygonClock.cell a i) (fun i _ => affineCell (fun i => point D (a i)) i)
    (point D) (0 : I) (0 : I) rfl
  intro i hi v
  obtain ⟨j, hj, ha, hab, hb⟩ := h.2.2.2 i hi
  exact (point_affine D hj ⟨ha, hab.trans hb⟩ ⟨ha.trans hab, hb⟩ v).symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GeneralTopology/RectanglePerimeterMesh.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Complex/RectanglePerimeterMesh.lean#L173).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `92704720d1436269c03efc01a2a20e9be857cf5a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
