WholePropertyBundleAndConsequences — individual source review
Attribution: ATTRIBUTION_CLARIFICATION_NEEDED
Issue: https://github.com/grwtsk/math/issues/254
Provisional mathematical ideas and direction: grwtsk contributors.
Provisional composite search, probabilistic symbolic recombination and linearized diffusive computation: OpenAI/Codex.
Cache warming and model sculpting: the countless, often unnamed mathematicians, enthusiasts, and curious minds whose work and questions have helped shape these tools, and who now have new ways to pursue mathematical answers to the endlessly deep question: “Why?”
These are owner-supplied provisional roles; exact contributions and source lineage need clarification.

# Topology capability for designated Cantor representations

No instance is manufactured from a set-theoretic equivalence.  Compactness,
metrizability, perfection, total disconnectedness, and a clopen basis must be
provided for the concrete topology before the project may claim Cantor-space
topology or a homeomorphic baseline interpreter.
