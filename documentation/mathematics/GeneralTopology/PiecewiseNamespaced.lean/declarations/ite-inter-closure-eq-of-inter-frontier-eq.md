## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ccc4a56c-1a40-b5ee-9138-248e35db0d26`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 150–154.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ite_inter_closure_eq_of_inter_frontier_eq
    (ht : s ∩ frontier t = s' ∩ frontier t) : t.ite s s' ∩ closure t = s ∩ closure t := by
  rw [closure_eq_self_union_frontier, inter_union_distrib_left, inter_union_distrib_left,
    ite_inter_self, ite_inter_of_inter_eq _ ht]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GeneralTopology/PiecewiseNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Piecewise/Variant667456249ca4fba63a4fc916842d61870a5aeeffe78af7f72eedbbe1b7fc0ec6.lean#L150).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f102a6f26d742f900fc3cf8913346ba09f755fc4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
