## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:65881982-070b-1832-7168-23dd5ee5af59`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 210–223.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cancel_left {g : PseudoEpimorphism β γ} {f₁ f₂ : PseudoEpimorphism α β} (hg : Injective g) :
    g.comp f₁ = g.comp f₂ ↔ f₁ = f₂ :=
  ⟨fun h => ext fun a => hg <| by rw [← comp_apply, h, comp_apply], congr_arg _⟩

end PseudoEpimorphism

variable [TopologicalSpace α] [Preorder α] [TopologicalSpace β] [Preorder β] [TopologicalSpace γ]
  [Preorder γ] [TopologicalSpace δ] [Preorder δ]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GeneralTopology/EsakiaNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Esakia/Variant64121adc2c86594a304c6fefadba0dad86e62ad5aa9c7c1a8f0f65e0e788eb78.lean#L210).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b6277540d1b0d1d6ce6f1c94a3ca56bef37b48c1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
