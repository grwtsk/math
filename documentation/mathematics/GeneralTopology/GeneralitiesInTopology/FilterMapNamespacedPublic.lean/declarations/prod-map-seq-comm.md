## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a106eba5-2fb8-662d-d10a-c82ef3252125`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 909–920.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem prod_map_seq_comm (f : Filter α) (g : Filter β) :
    (map Prod.mk f).seq g = seq (map (fun b a => (a, b)) g) f := by
  refine le_antisymm (le_seq fun s hs t ht => ?_) (le_seq fun s hs t ht => ?_)
  · rcases mem_map_iff_exists_image.1 hs with ⟨u, hu, hs⟩
    grw [← hs]
    rw [← Set.prod_image_seq_comm]
    exact seq_mem_seq (image_mem_map ht) hu
  · rcases mem_map_iff_exists_image.1 hs with ⟨u, hu, hs⟩
    grw [← hs]
    rw [Set.prod_image_seq_comm]
    exact seq_mem_seq (image_mem_map ht) hu

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/GeneralTopology/GeneralitiesInTopology/FilterMapNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Map/Variant43b34b133e19845daaf5d7100be4b87820166b5db0af6ccd4c1c9139b0c16822.lean#L909).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `20f11329d87c768ca917149752e989ed780e83a7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
