## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c251bfd6-93b5-0e40-bb03-6423d940879d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 304–312.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsPathConnected.image' (hF : IsPathConnected F)
    {f : X → Y} (hf : ContinuousOn f F) : IsPathConnected (f '' F) := by
  rcases hF with ⟨x, x_in, hx⟩
  use f x, mem_image_of_mem f x_in
  rintro _ ⟨y, y_in, rfl⟩
  refine ⟨(hx y_in).somePath.map' ?_, fun t ↦ ⟨_, (hx y_in).somePath_mem t, rfl⟩⟩
  exact hf.mono (range_subset_iff.2 (hx y_in).somePath_mem)

/-- If `f` is continuous and `F` is path-connected, so is `f(F)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GeneralTopology/ConnectedPathConnectedNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PathConnected/Variant557b970607cca4c1cb3d3a12071d52b8ff1d8b3f11747219c2104b43111f6942.lean#L304).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1250a5e9a07eaf0a7012e3acf4f45464b21fa052` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
