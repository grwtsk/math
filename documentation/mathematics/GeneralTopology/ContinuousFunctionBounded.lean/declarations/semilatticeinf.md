## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5eeb8ef2d85eaa549de63eb1fdcaf14e0b71ad07da7574668468136f50a08e5a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1519–1535.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance semilatticeInf : SemilatticeInf (α →ᵇ β) :=
  { BoundedContinuousFunction.partialOrder with
    inf := fun f g =>
      { toFun := fun t => f t ⊓ g t
        continuous_toFun := f.continuous.inf g.continuous
        map_bounded' := by
          obtain ⟨C₁, hf⟩ := f.bounded
          obtain ⟨C₂, hg⟩ := g.bounded
          refine' ⟨C₁ + C₂, fun x y => _⟩
          simp_rw [NormedAddCommGroup.dist_eq] at hf hg ⊢
          exact (norm_inf_sub_inf_le_add_norm _ _ _ _).trans (add_le_add (hf _ _) (hg _ _)) }
    inf_le_left := fun f g => ContinuousMap.le_def.mpr fun _ => inf_le_left
    inf_le_right := fun f g => ContinuousMap.le_def.mpr fun _ => inf_le_right
    le_inf := fun f g₁ g₂ w₁ w₂ =>
      ContinuousMap.le_def.mpr fun _ =>
        le_inf (ContinuousMap.le_def.mp w₁ _) (ContinuousMap.le_def.mp w₂ _) }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GeneralTopology/ContinuousFunctionBounded.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bounded/Variant83e1d9c7f5303e4cfa3597d20171233b28a2c156ebf3d5ea2d8f69dce5c47fb1.lean#L1519).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27d2fbe28b79cb92d1c25e2ae69b7b16163015e8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
