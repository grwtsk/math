## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a9c4916f83b40dd4f98705aeab038ba38e71e1d20326a38df37c1022213499d3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 202–222.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def struct : EffectiveEpiFamilyStruct X π where
  desc := fun e h => (ιIso π surj).inv ≫ (structAux π surj).desc e (fun a₁ a₂ g₁ g₂ hh => by
    apply h
    rw [← cancel_mono (ιIso _ surj).inv]
    simpa only [Category.assoc, π_comp_ι_inv])
  fac := by
    intro W e h a
    simp only [Eq.ndrec, id_eq, eq_mpr_eq_cast, π_comp_ι_inv_assoc, (structAux π surj).fac]
  uniq := by
    intro W e h m hm
    dsimp
    rw [Iso.eq_inv_comp]
    apply (structAux π surj).uniq
    intro a
    simpa using hm a

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GeneralTopology/ProfiniteEffectiveEpiNamespacedRelation.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/EffectiveEpi/Variant01f9884f5c4e2062dfbc674e8b496444d966ff0d599cfdd7977aaee035bb461f.lean#L202).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aca8cb692be544dbf607c65349f7f2a6453cfd88` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
