## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a6a9f95618549926df61dd3a9e7f4c11c8cd93c25f7863d1ff4e32e53f558bd7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 321–329.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def extractionRefinement {N p e after : ℕ} (s : State N)
    (c : ExactExtraction s.residual p e after) : Refinement s (extract s c) where
  added := Finsupp.single p e
  added_primes := primeMap_single c.prime
  residual_split := by simpa [extract, primeProduct_single, Nat.mul_comm] using c.split
  extracted_update := rfl
  exclusions_preserved := Finset.subset_insert _ _

/-- A generic divisor certificate splits unresolved scales without declaring either factor prime. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/Combinatorics/FactorStateNamespacedEdition2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/FactorState/Variant2630cb9fd9a09f36267e690cd8f9f47f187abed506777e5b444d3517b9868b60.lean#L321).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `64cd8c1309f84658298d38c6cedf1b08eca26035` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
