## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7b8748eb9919a89e8cbac3a69cd8326afe6186a957639d11b2e1654a2efc92f6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 556–560.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance killCopies.edgeSet.instFintype : Fintype (G.killCopies H).edgeSet :=
  .ofInjective (Set.inclusion <| edgeSet_mono killCopies_le_left) <| Set.inclusion_injective _

/-- Removing an edge from `H` for each subgraph isomorphic to `G` means that the number of edges
we've removed is at most the number of copies of `G` in `H`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/Combinatorics/GraphTheory/Copy.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Copy/Variant6baf36ab48c497454e867a01631d42dc476740d8f79b2bb4bf4f9b1393d8d1ff.lean#L556).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dd97628b246046c05d7d746b1448f3f2d5010d6a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
