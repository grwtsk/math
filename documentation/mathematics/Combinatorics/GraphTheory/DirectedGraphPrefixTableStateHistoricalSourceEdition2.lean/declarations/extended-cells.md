## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5d680c8e-e9af-8e9e-ae39-c199e76a1fbb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 260–273.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem extended_cells (state : State V Key) (hstate : WellFormed state)
    (rows : List (Key × Occurrence state.root)) :
    extendedNodes state rows = (extendedDictionary state rows).map
      (IncrementalPrefixTable.cell (extendedDictionary state rows)) := by
  have hold : state.nodes = state.dictionary.map
      (IncrementalPrefixTable.cell (extendedDictionary state rows)) := by
    rw [hstate.cells]
    apply List.map_congr_left
    intro initial hmem
    exact (old_cell_stable state hstate rows initial hmem).symm
  rw [extendedNodes, hold, ← List.map_append]
  rfl

/-- The actual updater closes the structural invariant on arbitrary stored states. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/Combinatorics/GraphTheory/DirectedGraphPrefixTableStateHistoricalSourceEdition2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/DirectedGraph/PrefixTableState.lean#L260).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b7ca2ab0d88aa2c53f1e942fa124042fe453a2ca` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
