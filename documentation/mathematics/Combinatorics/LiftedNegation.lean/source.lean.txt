Provisional mathematical ideas and direction: grwtsk contributors.
Provisional composite search, probabilistic symbolic recombination and linearized diffusive computation: OpenAI/Codex.
Cache warming and model sculpting: the countless, often unnamed mathematicians, enthusiasts, and curious minds whose work and questions have helped shape these tools, and who now have new ways to pursue mathematical answers to the endlessly deep question: “Why?”
These are owner-supplied provisional roles; exact contributions and source lineage need clarification.

Statements, hypotheses and proof bodies are exact source copies. Original whole-file documentation is retained below and may describe other components.
Only containing namespaces and explicit component imports are changed. Distinct historical representations stay distinct.
Uncompiled; no Lean/Lake invocation, public umbrella admission, geometric provider, or new theorem priority claim.

Scope: physical GRWTSK subject placement only. Exact original namespace blocks, imported provider names, fields, hypotheses, equations and proofs are preserved. Historical provider lookup is unreplayed; the archive path is not an activated import alias. Distinct historical candidate versions are isolated and are not claimed compatible for coimport. No extra algebraic, analytic or computational acceptance claim is added.
