## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f8f622f5-9a37-f4c4-257d-696c11e2a775`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 438–445.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem fixture_missing_horizon_coverage :
    ¬ (∀ p, p.Prime → p ≤ (initial 4 (by omega)).horizon →
      p ∈ (initial 4 (by omega)).excluded) := by
  intro h
  have h2 := h 2 (by norm_num) (by norm_num [State.horizon, initial])
  simp [initial] at h2

/-- A negative record cannot migrate to an unrelated residual where it is false. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/Combinatorics/FactorStateEdition2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/FactorState/Variantbc39076411ed8dfb5ee850b4c780ab2c861e42eaefa00b5e15c9ddd1465f2a59.lean#L438).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `82988026bae26e16d3a9a8d9672b38d8473f7864` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
