## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2437754ec9284890118d1fddc15914e8d27e3db4c5d3d9caeefeb937e0173006`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 76–86.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure IsAddFreimanHom [AddCommMonoid α] [AddCommMonoid β] (n : ℕ) (A : Set α) (B : Set β)
    (f : α → β) : Prop where
  mapsTo : MapsTo f A B
  /-- An additive `n`-Freiman homomorphism preserves sums of `n` elements. -/
  map_sum_eq_map_sum ⦃s t : Multiset α⦄ (hsA : ∀ ⦃x⦄, x ∈ s → x ∈ A) (htA : ∀ ⦃x⦄, x ∈ t → x ∈ A)
    (hs : Multiset.card s = n) (ht : Multiset.card t = n) (h : s.sum = t.sum) :
    (s.map f).sum = (t.map f).sum

/-- An `n`-Freiman homomorphism from a set `A` to a set `B` is a map which preserves products of `n`
elements. -/
@[to_additive]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/Combinatorics/FreimanHom.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/FreimanHom/Variantf4fca3fec5c5765fe88c9822bdff5a0fe533c68d1df0955c675596f949707250.lean#L76).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4afea7c40adf7c8ec81ca06be2363b041f29dc78` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
