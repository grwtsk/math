## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c7ec0795c363be0adf1be9078d6f3102f9c171b6a98285b9d907e0dfbecae426`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 224–228.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : IsPartialOrder (Graph α β) (· ≤s ·) where
  refl G := ⟨le_refl G, rfl⟩
  trans _ _ _ h₁ h₂ := h₁.trans h₂
  antisymm _ _ h₁ h₂ := h₁.1.antisymm h₂.1

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/Combinatorics/SubgraphNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Subgraph/Variantb57a3db081d39337dd47fa49473d2c9a3bb09a14bf07bad3e1955d1f27fb1506.lean#L224).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9d6f5b87d15931618fa4f38a605e0ab82c5b1e80` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
