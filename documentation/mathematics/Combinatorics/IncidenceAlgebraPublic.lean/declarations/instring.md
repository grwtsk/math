## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:214fd9bf459117ec636c63c60941d1eb83b869013fcf943a664e9d292cf603a2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 241–250.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instRing [Preorder α] [LocallyFiniteOrder α] [DecidableEq α] [Ring 𝕜] :
    Ring (IncidenceAlgebra 𝕜 α) where
  __ := instSemiring
  __ := instAddGroup

/-! ### Scalar multiplication between incidence algebras -/

section SMul
variable [Preorder α] [LocallyFiniteOrder α] [AddCommMonoid 𝕜] [AddCommMonoid 𝕝] [SMul 𝕜 𝕝]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/Combinatorics/IncidenceAlgebraPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/IncidenceAlgebra/Variantd424fe1db42cc93c07166eb7f7a88e4f952927a93aeb877d1174aab7b276b9e5.lean#L241).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `18829c3e77c70d45911215890a2ec673cafd78f0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
