## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8411af3125f876a74442481649abefbc84304c8e80af5a6834b927bd74e67375`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 178–186.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Monoid CircleDeg1Lift where
  mul f g :=
    { toOrderHom := f.1.comp g.1
      map_add_one' := fun x => by simp [map_add_one] }
  one := ⟨.id, fun _ => rfl⟩
  mul_one f := rfl
  one_mul f := rfl
  mul_assoc f₁ f₂ f₃ := FunLike.coe_injective rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/Topology/GeneralTopology/TranslationNumber/Variantacb4711f796682e68a1835b27bd674df7087131ee33ac1e51a59a2bdcef18d87.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/TranslationNumber/Variantacb4711f796682e68a1835b27bd674df7087131ee33ac1e51a59a2bdcef18d87.lean#L178).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `af72e3fe717e1d7fecd4defc5613fcf324547514` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
