## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:149eb4f3f526f53e112532f8aa82aea50a9bad1d68bdcc03e0b289443ef38067`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 700–708.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def Set.BijOn.equiv {α : Type*} {β : Type*} {s : Set α} {t : Set β} (f : α → β)
    (h : BijOn f s t) : s ≃ t :=
  Equiv.ofBijective _ h.bijective
#align set.bij_on.equiv Set.BijOn.equiv

/-- The composition of an updated function with an equiv on a subtype can be expressed as an
updated function. -/
-- porting note: replace `s : Set α` and `: s` with `p : α → Prop` and `: Subtype p`, since the
-- former now unfolds syntactically to a less general case of the latter.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/MathematicalLogicAndFoundations/GeneralLogic/EquivSetSubsetImage.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Set/Variant4f1db66223131acfece338c5016a4b8e808f27dd482e240b9c6d958f95db33ee.lean#L700).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `527038b2b336bf97df8e461ee4220c1cd8d9ca14` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
