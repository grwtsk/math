## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0b0455a0aa2f3542ab54e2f2805e9301ad69b57cc889e2a7083b5373ca8d9b5d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 400–408.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def ring [Ring β] : Ring α := by
  let mul := e.mul
  let add_group_with_one := e.addGroupWithOne
  let npow := e.pow ℕ
  apply e.injective.ring _ <;> intros <;> exact e.apply_symm_apply _
#align equiv.ring Equiv.ring

/-- Transfer `NonUnitalCommRing` across an `Equiv` -/
@[reducible]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/MathematicalLogicAndFoundations/GeneralLogic/LogicEquivTransferInstance.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/TransferInstance/Variant0d8d8a858170cd4d4005205eca723bfe3da6bec84dbfe9a175dcf95a7cb91f99.lean#L400).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `318cd0b49bd63174a8e2d59b18cfef5d91001b18` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
