## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:497ac3fa-5914-ee04-50d3-466a18249a05`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 623–627.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected lemma GrowsPolynomially.pow (p : ℕ) (hf : GrowsPolynomially f)
    (hf_nonneg : ∀ᶠ x in atTop, 0 ≤ f x) : GrowsPolynomially fun x => (f x) ^ p := by
  simp_rw [← rpow_natCast]
  exact hf.rpow p hf_nonneg

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/MathematicalLogicAndFoundations/ComputabilityAndRecursionTheory/GrowsPolynomiallyNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/GrowsPolynomially/Variant64f81a50cd5e906be2e2e7447243fec657abe8a6d0470c61080356a28ca1dfa1.lean#L623).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aca5227fb6989013166939f38c06d52ed2b6365b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
