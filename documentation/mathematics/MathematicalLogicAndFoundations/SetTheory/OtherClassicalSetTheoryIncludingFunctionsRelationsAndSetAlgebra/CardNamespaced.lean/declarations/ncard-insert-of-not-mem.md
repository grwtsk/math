## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:52b7a96f-17d2-839e-f7bd-b1aa1ba872fa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 576–581.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] theorem ncard_insert_of_not_mem (h : a ∉ s) (hs : s.Finite := by toFinite_tac) :
    (insert a s).ncard = s.ncard + 1 := by
  rw [←Nat.cast_inj (R := ℕ∞), (hs.insert a).cast_ncard_eq, Nat.cast_add, Nat.cast_one,
    hs.cast_ncard_eq, encard_insert_of_not_mem h]
#align set.ncard_insert_of_not_mem Set.ncard_insert_of_not_mem

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/MathematicalLogicAndFoundations/SetTheory/OtherClassicalSetTheoryIncludingFunctionsRelationsAndSetAlgebra/CardNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Card/Variante13bb44e5ccc789e2db99535a5dd29fb27a7fb3f7cfb2f6e7e44f70fa37708f3.lean#L576).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `16945019db9e8a5bfbfb2033b2e555b7d7b7eaf1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
