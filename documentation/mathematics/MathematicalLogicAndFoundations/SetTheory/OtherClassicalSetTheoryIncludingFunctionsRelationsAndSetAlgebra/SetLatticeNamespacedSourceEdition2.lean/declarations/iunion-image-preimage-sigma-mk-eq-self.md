## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:609cf7a2-07ef-a698-d866-90ff58538715`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 978–988.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem iUnion_image_preimage_sigma_mk_eq_self {ι : Type*} {σ : ι → Type*} (s : Set (Sigma σ)) :
    ⋃ i, Sigma.mk i '' (Sigma.mk i ⁻¹' s) = s := by
  ext x
  simp only [mem_iUnion, mem_image, mem_preimage]
  constructor
  · rintro ⟨i, a, h, rfl⟩
    exact h
  · intro h
    obtain ⟨i, a⟩ := x
    exact ⟨i, a, h, rfl⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/MathematicalLogicAndFoundations/SetTheory/OtherClassicalSetTheoryIncludingFunctionsRelationsAndSetAlgebra/SetLatticeNamespacedSourceEdition2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Lattice/Variant913dbe9e6b55abda0af0d83e5ddd9ea2abd9eb6298339849a8b0130dcc128c2b.lean#L978).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `756bd7fe83f9893423daf234b3cdfef026bfb5d4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
