## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0baf9cf32a437b906d1acb389d279064e4979dc561faf2e34992eaeeb126428b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 141–149.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring (SetSemiring α) :=
  { (inferInstance : AddCommMonoid (SetSemiring α)) with
    mul := fun s t => Set.up (image2 (· * ·) (SetSemiring.down s) (SetSemiring.down t))
    zero_mul := fun _ => empty_mul
    mul_zero := fun _ => mul_empty
    left_distrib := fun _ _ _ => mul_union
    right_distrib := fun _ _ _ => union_mul }

-- TODO: port
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/MathematicalLogicAndFoundations/SetTheory/OtherClassicalSetTheoryIncludingFunctionsRelationsAndSetAlgebra/SetSemiringSemiringSourceEdition2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Semiring/Variant8f1647897dd383cd6ea75056d3c19292fd00a71631410f7dced528ea6dd46ea9.lean#L141).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b6c5dd8cac28be3654734c1769d7b71804bac51e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
