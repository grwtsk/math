## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d43bcca9-f9ae-6510-b4bc-2b8bbdd86266`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 220–226.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem image_restrictPreimage :
    t.restrictPreimage f '' (Subtype.val ⁻¹' s) = Subtype.val ⁻¹' (f '' s) := by
  delta Set.restrictPreimage
  rw [← (Subtype.coe_injective).image_injective.eq_iff, ← image_comp, MapsTo.restrict_commutes,
    image_comp, Subtype.image_preimage_coe, Subtype.image_preimage_coe, image_preimage_inter]

variable (f) in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/MathematicalLogicAndFoundations/SetTheory/OtherClassicalSetTheoryIncludingFunctionsRelationsAndSetAlgebra/RestrictNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Restrict/Variantd7532e91be060e7cd05841020c5d63d81f0c25ee4b72948b80fcfa949adbdb52.lean#L220).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7b4cc804649d38a2eb2636797a7df91ee8c9c8bb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
