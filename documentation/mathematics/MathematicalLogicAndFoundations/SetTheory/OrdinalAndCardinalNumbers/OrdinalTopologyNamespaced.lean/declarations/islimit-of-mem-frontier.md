## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c5e66c7a-c6fe-87dc-0612-87c007383087`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 181–190.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isLimit_of_mem_frontier (ha : a ∈ frontier s) : IsLimit a := by
  simp only [frontier_eq_closure_inter_closure, Set.mem_inter_iff, mem_closure_iff] at ha
  by_contra h
  rw [← isOpen_singleton_iff] at h
  rcases ha.1 _ h rfl with ⟨b, hb, hb'⟩
  rcases ha.2 _ h rfl with ⟨c, hc, hc'⟩
  rw [Set.mem_singleton_iff] at *
  subst hb; subst hc
  exact hc' hb'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/MathematicalLogicAndFoundations/SetTheory/OrdinalAndCardinalNumbers/OrdinalTopologyNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variant06909ffbbfa0588d815f3a1fefbfd26a257cb51dd2b9c337c6d8ef75ea22f38b.lean#L181).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ba2974f5702c832a8dbdae18fb014df5ff9d2f27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
