## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:aeaef65bb07691bdc619c4befd79f41a6e746e8920ef59245d58aeae167d814a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 787–793.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class IsManifold {𝕜 : Type*} [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜] {E : Type*}
    [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace 𝕜 E] {H : Type*} [TopologicalSpace H]
    (I : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E H) (n : ℕ∞ω) (M : Type*)
    [TopologicalSpace M] [ChartedSpace H M] : Prop
    extends HasGroupoid M (contDiffGroupoid n I)

/-- Building a `C^n` manifold from a `HasGroupoid` assumption. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/DifferentialGeometry/IsManifoldBasicNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantb75d2a0a945883dddf9c791a81249156400b3bbd2b86234dfcf49fba7958a0ff.lean#L787).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f0cb153a5bdcbc6cea6e97ac3f6447d88c871eee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
