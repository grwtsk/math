## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4aa17ea7-78c0-2ba2-e428-aa90cad8265e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 596–607.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isSubmersion (h : IsSubmersionOfComplement F I J n f) : IsSubmersion I J n f := by
  by_cases! hM : IsEmpty M
  · rw [IsSubmersion]
    use PUnit, by infer_instance, by infer_instance
    exact fun x ↦ (IsEmpty.false x).elim
  inhabit M
  let x : M := Inhabited.default
  use (h x).smallComplement, by infer_instance, by infer_instance
  exact (IsSubmersionOfComplement.congr_F (h x).smallEquiv).mp h

open IsManifold in
/-- The identity map is a submersion with complement `PUnit`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/DifferentialGeometry/SubmersionNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/Submersion/Variant0f57a2c92083c4c58bff412abcd0d02d5c8bd3a14b2465b5ce45d782a6fc8416.lean#L596).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1b2d6db7f87cab54ef603327a5fed6069f5d23d7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
