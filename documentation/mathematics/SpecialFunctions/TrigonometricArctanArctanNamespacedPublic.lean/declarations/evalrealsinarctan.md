## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f301c68a00ea75a03b04ceb894f52e7240de1a1942b0974e25efaec107a2034f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 440–457.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
meta def evalRealSinArctan : PositivityExt where eval {u α} z p e :=
  match p with | none => pure .none | some p => do
  match u, α, e with
  | 0, ~q(ℝ), ~q(Real.sin (Real.arctan $a)) =>
    match ← core z p a with
    | .positive pa =>
      assumeInstancesCommute
      return .positive q(Real.sin_arctan_pos.mpr $pa)
    | .nonnegative na =>
      assumeInstancesCommute
      return .nonnegative q(Real.sin_arctan_nonneg.mpr $na)
    | .nonzero na =>
      assumeInstancesCommute
      return .nonzero q(mt Real.sin_arctan_eq_zero.mp $na)
    | .none => return .none
  | _ => throwError "not Real.sin (Real.arctan _)"

end Mathlib.Meta.Positivity
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/SpecialFunctions/TrigonometricArctanArctanNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Arctan/Variant2c5c7e8704c392d76eb5a079f0c9484d9a76e6f65911d361702bc8b8379d6575.lean#L440).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77da4ae6756801f991387a08cd4481be4143e1c4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
