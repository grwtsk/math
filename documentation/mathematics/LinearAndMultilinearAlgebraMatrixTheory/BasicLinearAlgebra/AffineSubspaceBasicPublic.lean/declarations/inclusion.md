## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d8e0bc1334bc748acb3b2c0a580080527e24bc7ac8736fee4ff03a835e65afe3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 628–636.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def inclusion (h : S₁ ≤ S₂) :
    letI := Nonempty.map (Set.inclusion h) ‹_›
    S₁ →ᵃ[k] S₂ :=
  letI := Nonempty.map (Set.inclusion h) ‹_›
  { toFun := Set.inclusion h
    linear := Submodule.inclusion <| AffineSubspace.direction_le h
    map_vadd' := fun ⟨_,_⟩ ⟨_,_⟩ => rfl }

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/LinearAndMultilinearAlgebraMatrixTheory/BasicLinearAlgebra/AffineSubspaceBasicPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Basic/Variantdb5899ae68516888a4a145c4db177581c763c35959f1928dee73631a0bc4b979.lean#L628).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a77c46d9fd3c0a1f786a861aa9687a5198caf1d9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
