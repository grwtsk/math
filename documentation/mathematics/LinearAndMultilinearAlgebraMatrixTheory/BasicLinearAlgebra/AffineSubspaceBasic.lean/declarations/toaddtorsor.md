## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cc341bf404fafee795ace4423300ef5d9f459245cb5db16d2e3b0201153b4409`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 64–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev toAddTorsor (s : AffineSubspace k P) [Nonempty s] : AddTorsor s.direction s where
  vadd a b := ⟨(a : V) +ᵥ (b : P), vadd_mem_of_mem_direction a.2 b.2⟩
  zero_vadd := fun a => by
    ext
    exact zero_vadd _ _
  add_vadd a b c := by
    ext
    apply add_vadd
  vsub a b := ⟨(a : P) -ᵥ (b : P), (vsub_left_mem_direction_iff_mem a.2 _).mpr b.2⟩
  vsub_vadd' a b := by
    ext
    apply AddTorsor.vsub_vadd'
  vadd_vsub' a b := by
    ext
    apply AddTorsor.vadd_vsub'

attribute [local instance] toAddTorsor

@[simp, norm_cast]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/LinearAndMultilinearAlgebraMatrixTheory/BasicLinearAlgebra/AffineSubspaceBasic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Basic/Varianta079d2422f5fd475b41ed521dd77b194873a8c369ec0bce8d7dc2273a837ac23.lean#L64).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c938fe73d2fb879b088149edf36b2f75c1e848f8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
