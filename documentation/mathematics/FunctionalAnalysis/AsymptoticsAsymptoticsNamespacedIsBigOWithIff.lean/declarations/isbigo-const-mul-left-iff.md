## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f5a91eb2-5596-9400-4870-ae8538a83d86`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1525–1529.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isBigO_const_mul_left_iff' {f : α → R} {c : R} (hc : IsUnit c) :
    (fun x => c * f x) =O[l] g ↔ f =O[l] g :=
  ⟨(isBigO_self_const_mul' hc f l).trans, fun h => h.const_mul_left c⟩
#align asymptotics.is_O_const_mul_left_iff' Asymptotics.isBigO_const_mul_left_iff'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/FunctionalAnalysis/AsymptoticsAsymptoticsNamespacedIsBigOWithIff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Asymptotics/Variant377353307c0a3db2816f5173c47d1d44336562d918cadc1bce23b885ffbc0abf.lean#L1525).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27a1f07fb7322d9d503f3ee04605ed750d6ba18a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
