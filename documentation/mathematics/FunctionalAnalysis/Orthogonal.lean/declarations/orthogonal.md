## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:77b8a7ed79078a095dcc4b050d50e093f5f7ec0e170d838a93c57a2cbb9a2b88`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 37–46.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def orthogonal : Submodule 𝕜 E where
  carrier := { v | ∀ u ∈ K, ⟪u, v⟫ = 0 }
  zero_mem' _ _ := inner_zero_right _
  add_mem' hx hy u hu := by rw [inner_add_right, hx u hu, hy u hu, add_zero]
  smul_mem' c x hx u hu := by rw [inner_smul_right, hx u hu, mul_zero]

@[inherit_doc]
notation:1200 K "ᗮ" => orthogonal K

/-- When a vector is in `Kᗮ`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/FunctionalAnalysis/Orthogonal.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Orthogonal/Variant2507cafe1cc9dcec46b6ced0336784393889aeb33d5ec3f79a3f3f944cf6082a.lean#L37).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `021ac00fe674b12cfb30009a9052deb5f5706e25` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
