## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5761f8af-a0f3-c9eb-5b72-7e1bd4c435c7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 843–849.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_comp_map (hf : ψ.comp f₁ = f₂.comp φ) (hg : ψ.comp g₁ = g₂.comp φ)
    (hf' : ψ'.comp f₂ = f₃.comp φ') (hg' : ψ'.comp g₂ = g₃.comp φ') :
    (map φ' ψ' hf' hg').comp (map φ ψ hf hg) =
      map (φ'.comp φ) (ψ'.comp ψ) (comm_sq₂ hf hf') (comm_sq₂ hg hg') := by
  ext
  rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/FunctionalAnalysis/NormedLinearSpacesAndBanachSpacesBanachLattices/GroupHomNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Hom/Variantaff349f4defb95b7fb72af64567529575ab15720c0f8a6d868637219fb8bfb37.lean#L843).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7112c599b0081688cfe0b4890f026ac034186c39` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
