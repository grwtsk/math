## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:14b629568bc05e79bcc5362f4775aeb65214e0f46d55c786bb071c561aaaa392`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 75–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {R A : Type*} [CommRing R] [StarRing R] [NormedRing A] [Algebra R A] [StarRing A]
    [ContinuousStar A] [StarModule R A] (a : A) [IsStarNormal a] :
    NormedCommRing (elementalStarAlgebra R a) :=
  { SubringClass.toNormedRing (elementalStarAlgebra R a) with
    mul_comm := mul_comm }

-- porting note: these hack instances no longer seem to be necessary
#noalign elemental_star_algebra.complex.normed_algebra

variable [CompleteSpace A] (a : A) [IsStarNormal a] (S : StarSubalgebra ℂ A)

/-- This lemma is used in the proof of `elementalStarAlgebra.isUnit_of_isUnit_of_isStarNormal`,
which in turn is the key to spectral permanence `StarSubalgebra.spectrum_eq`, which is itself
necessary for the continuous functional calculus. Using the continuous functional calculus, this
lemma can be superseded by one that omits the `IsStarNormal` hypothesis. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/FunctionalAnalysis/ContinuousFunctionalCalculusNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ContinuousFunctionalCalculus/Variantd14fe49ef272724ee09462f7989c80847ae3dc6fe5446d90b7570d4b540917e5.lean#L75).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cc545264d40716b7a34d7f75c903fec0ec1749c9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
