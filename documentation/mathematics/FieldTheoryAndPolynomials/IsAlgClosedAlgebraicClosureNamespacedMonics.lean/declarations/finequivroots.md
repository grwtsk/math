## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1576cb4858e1e4ac28b267ebd116748814744e65bae42989e29f4288eace85e7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 69–74.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def finEquivRoots {K} [Field K] [DecidableEq K] {i : k →+* K} {f : Monics k} (hf : f.1.Splits i) :
    Fin f.1.natDegree ≃ (f.1.map i).roots.toEnumFinset :=
  .symm <| Finset.equivFinOfCardEq <| by
    rwa [← splits_id_iff_splits, splits_iff_card_roots,
      ← Multiset.card_toEnumFinset, f.2.natDegree_map] at hf

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/FieldTheoryAndPolynomials/IsAlgClosedAlgebraicClosureNamespacedMonics.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/AlgebraicClosure/Variant898827f82e453e77cfc4c8f749b74fbea18435ed1cd2580c208778306d3158ec.lean#L69).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d77bc9d03bc9d168b7bda8218c18d2b8390d7601` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
