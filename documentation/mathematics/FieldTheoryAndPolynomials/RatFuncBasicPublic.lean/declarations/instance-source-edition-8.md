## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2407df2cdcd0c14d6f2e6edbbd9899195d6a3cb749d8ef88d7afc4ca6363c1e1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 812–818.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (R A K : Type*) [CommRing A] [IsDomain A] [Field K] [Algebra A[X] K]
    [FaithfulSMul A[X] K] [CommSemiring R] [Algebra R A[X]] [SMul R K] [IsScalarTower R A[X] K] :
    IsScalarTower R A⟮X⟯ K :=
  IsScalarTower.to₁₃₄ _ A[X] _ _

/-- Let `K / k / A⟮X⟯ / A[X]` be a tower. If `K / k / A[X]` is a scalar tower
then so is `K / k / A⟮X⟯`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/FieldTheoryAndPolynomials/RatFuncBasicPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Varianteae3abf1c43a4123891fc0b204e16b2bfe41d0f3374bbd3a8b71f180a6321901.lean#L812).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9fbd322f65c4f3cd91a3f97e0cf4d95605f5e20b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
