## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6ac14859489defbb7b0eea84b58e90e5fa5ad5f2ddde35b317529773f235df3b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 708–723.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isSeparable_tower_top [Algebra.IsSeparable F K] : Algebra.IsSeparable M K :=
  Algebra.isSeparable_tower_top_of_isSeparable F M K

end IntermediateField

end Field

section AlgEquiv

open RingHom RingEquiv

variable {A₁ B₁ A₂ B₂ : Type*} [Field A₁] [Ring B₁] [Field A₂] [Ring B₂]
    [Algebra A₁ B₁] [Algebra A₂ B₂] (e₁ : A₁ ≃+* A₂) (e₂ : B₁ ≃+* B₂)
    (he : RingHom.comp (algebraMap A₂ B₂) ↑e₁ = RingHom.comp ↑e₂ (algebraMap A₁ B₁))
include he

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/FieldTheoryAndPolynomials/FieldTheorySeparablePublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Separable/Variante2dcc1b5d2115b14a25404cb188bd0e5cadb96d30e57b4dcba2abad77398fce1.lean#L708).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `262e555aab5e7b0eb75b51c9931f3307d801e2c8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
