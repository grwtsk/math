## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c5301923-e60e-d42f-b7de-765a0d11adb8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 300–305.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem derivWithin_comp_of_eq (hh₂ : DifferentiableWithinAt 𝕜' h₂ s' y)
    (hh : DifferentiableWithinAt 𝕜 h s x) (hs : MapsTo h s s')
    (hy : h x = y) :
    derivWithin (h₂ ∘ h) s x = derivWithin h₂ s' (h x) * derivWithin h s x := by
  subst hy; exact derivWithin_comp x hh₂ hh hs

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/RealFunctions/DerivCompNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Comp/Variant420cc5786cb0047e4d5e3b781e2a63e444b1c9b7440f5b8ee2fb60bd089c5bf3.lean#L300).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `28f045223838b9630755d3acdd7d0f92839d9ce8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
