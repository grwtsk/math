WholeContinuationDataAndProjections — individual source review
Attribution: ATTRIBUTION_CLARIFICATION_NEEDED
Issue: https://github.com/grwtsk/math/issues/254
Provisional mathematical ideas and direction: grwtsk contributors.
Provisional composite search, probabilistic symbolic recombination and linearized diffusive computation: OpenAI/Codex.
Cache warming and model sculpting: the countless, often unnamed mathematicians, enthusiasts, and curious minds whose work and questions have helped shape these tools, and who now have new ways to pursue mathematical answers to the endlessly deep question: “Why?”
These are owner-supplied provisional roles; exact contributions and source lineage need clarification.

Statements, hypotheses and proof bodies are exact source copies. Original whole-file documentation is retained below and may describe other components.
Only containing namespaces and explicit component imports are changed. Distinct historical representations stay distinct.
Uncompiled; no Lean/Lake invocation, public umbrella admission, geometric provider, or new theorem priority claim.

/- Whole supplied dependent record and its two exact proof-field projections. All heatFamily/sourceComplex/targetComplex/chainMapData fields and both independent certified Props plus sourceLabel remain. chainMapData is only a Type, and neither respectsDifferential nor compactnessFredholmEstimates is tied by a typed equation to a constructed map. Captured SectionComplex has a typed graded family/differential but chooses its d_comp_d_zero and bounded Props independently. No analytic continuation map, compactness, Fredholm estimate, genuine complex law or imported provider realization is established. -/
