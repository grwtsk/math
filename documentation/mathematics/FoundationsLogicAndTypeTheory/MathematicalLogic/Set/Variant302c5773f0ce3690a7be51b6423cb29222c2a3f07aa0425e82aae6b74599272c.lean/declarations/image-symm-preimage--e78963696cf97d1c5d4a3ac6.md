## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:892ae739-d791-b009-7f57-bd1f8b7f04d3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 504–512.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem image_symm_preimage {α β} {f : α → β} (hf : Injective f) (u s : Set α) :
    (fun x => (Set.image f s hf).symm x : f '' s → α) ⁻¹' u = Subtype.val ⁻¹' (f '' u) := by
  ext ⟨b, a, has, rfl⟩
  have : ∀ h : ∃ a', a' ∈ s ∧ a' = a, Classical.choose h = a := fun h => (Classical.choose_spec h).2
  simp [Equiv.Set.image, Equiv.Set.imageOfInjOn, hf.eq_iff, this]
#align equiv.set.image_symm_preimage Equiv.Set.image_symm_preimage

/-- If `α` is equivalent to `β`, then `Set α` is equivalent to `Set β`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Set/Variant302c5773f0ce3690a7be51b6423cb29222c2a3f07aa0425e82aae6b74599272c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Set/Variant302c5773f0ce3690a7be51b6423cb29222c2a3f07aa0425e82aae6b74599272c.lean#L504).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `854d136bde8223995aa6c586afb59cbcfb53c628` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
