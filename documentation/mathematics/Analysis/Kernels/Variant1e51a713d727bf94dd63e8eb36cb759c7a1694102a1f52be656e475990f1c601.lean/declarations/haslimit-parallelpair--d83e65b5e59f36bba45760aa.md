## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1e8f092f507b6c7abea7d52b11f9e89562b7724732a26fd3adb4b4754430a661`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–134.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance hasLimit_parallelPair {V W : SemiNormedGroupCat.{u}} (f g : V ⟶ W) :
    HasLimit (parallelPair f g) where
  exists_limit :=
    Nonempty.intro
      { cone := fork f g
        isLimit :=
          Fork.IsLimit.mk _
            (fun c =>
              NormedAddGroupHom.ker.lift (Fork.ι c) _ <|
                show NormedAddGroupHom.compHom (f - g) c.ι = 0 by
                  rw [AddMonoidHom.map_sub, AddMonoidHom.sub_apply, sub_eq_zero]; exact c.condition)
            (fun c => NormedAddGroupHom.ker.incl_comp_lift _ _ _) fun c g h => by
        -- porting note: the `simp_rw` was was `rw [← h]` but motive is not type correct in mathlib4
              ext x; dsimp; simp_rw [← h]; rfl}
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false in
#align SemiNormedGroup.has_limit_parallel_pair SemiNormedGroupCat.hasLimit_parallelPair

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/Analysis/Kernels/Variant1e51a713d727bf94dd63e8eb36cb759c7a1694102a1f52be656e475990f1c601.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Kernels/Variant1e51a713d727bf94dd63e8eb36cb759c7a1694102a1f52be656e475990f1c601.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6298046e4f2620c99fad0c242b020241906d42b4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
