# Circle Averages

For a function `f` on the complex plane, this file introduces the definition
`Real.circleAverage f c R` as a shorthand for the average of `f` on the circle with center `c` and
radius `R`, equipped with the rotation-invariant measure of total volume one. Like
`IntervalAverage`, this notion exists as a convenience. It avoids notationally inconvenient
compositions of `f` with `circleMap` and avoids the need to manually elemininate `2 * π` every time
an average is computed.

Note: Like the interval average defined in `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Integral/IntervalAverage.lean`,
the `circleAverage` defined here is a purely measure-theoretic average. It should not be confused
with `circleIntegral`, which is the path integral over the circle path. The relevant integrability
property `circleAverage` is `CircleIntegrable`, as defined in
`Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Integral/CircleIntegral.lean`.

Implementation Note: Like `circleMap`, `circleAverage`s are defined for negative radii. The theorem
`circleAverage_congr_negRadius` shows that the average is independent of the radius' sign.

Define `circleAverage f c R` as the average value of `f` on the circle with center `c` and radius
`R`. This is a real notion, which should not be confused with the complex path integral notion
defined in `circleIntegral` (integrating with respect to `dz`).
