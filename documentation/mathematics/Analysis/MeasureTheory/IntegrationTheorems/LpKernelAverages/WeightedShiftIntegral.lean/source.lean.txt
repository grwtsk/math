# Uncompiled individually reviewed candidate: WeightedL2ShiftIntegral

Status: SOURCE_READ_SEAMS_REVIEWED_STATIC_ONLY.
Attribution: ATTRIBUTION_CLARIFICATION_NEEDED.
Shared clarification issue: https://github.com/grwtsk/math/issues/254
Provisional ideas and direction: grwtsk contributors.
Provisional computation: OpenAI/Codex — composite search, probabilistic symbolic
recombination, and linearized diffusive computation.
Cache warming and model sculpting: the countless, often unnamed mathematicians,
enthusiasts, and curious minds whose work and questions have helped shape these tools,
and who now have new ways to pursue mathematical answers to the endlessly deep question: “Why?”
These provisional roles and computational characterizations are user-supplied;
the exact contribution, source ancestry, attribution and mechanism need clarification.
Existing contributor identities, intellectual sources and applicable notices remain
separate. No mathematical priority, new theorem credit or proof acceptance is claimed.

Secondary topic: 510.5.060.010 lebesgue spaces.
This component retains the weighted-shift integrability, L²-valued integral and
integral norm bound. Its dependency on the translation candidate is explicit.
The original comment excludes a claimed half-line convolution operator; legacy
fixedKernel binding is UNRESOLVED, and no spectral or RH consequence is asserted.
All retained statements, explicit premises and proof/definition text are exact copies.
Namespace, candidate imports and any explicit ambient-context edits are receipted.
Original dependency selection, elaboration and proof checking remain unreplayed.
This candidate is outside the public umbrella. Lean and Lake have not been invoked.
