## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f12d3bfc-4cc8-8f3e-4fc0-5f2461e79ab1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 81–93.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem actual_smoothing_companion_bounds (A : ℝ) (hA : 40 ≤ A) :
    13 / 16 - criticalBaselineCorrection A ≤ actualSmoothingCompanion A ∧
      actualSmoothingCompanion A ≤ 10 / 3 := by
  have hA1 : 1 ≤ A := by linarith
  have hh := firstAtomHeadWork_signed_bounds A hA
  have hh0 := firstAtomHeadWork_nonpositive A hA
  have hg := actual_gamma_boundary_bounds A hA
  have hm := criticalContinuousMoment_strict_bounds hA1
  have hb := criticalBaselineCorrection_eq_actual A hA1
  unfold actualSmoothingCompanion
  constructor <;> linarith only [hh.1, hh0, hg.1, hg.2, hm.1, hb]

/-- Unconditional matched source inequalities; neither constructs an eventual J. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/MeasureAndIntegration/SourceActualSmoothingArithmeticAttemptEdition2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/SourceActualSmoothingArithmeticAttempt/Varianta3a22c7e455d2f42f2e07e2e5cd59c3cee657f223601a238ebf73f8010cb399a.lean#L81).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bd3284aad9ab970842602c70e21aad7bb17277cf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
