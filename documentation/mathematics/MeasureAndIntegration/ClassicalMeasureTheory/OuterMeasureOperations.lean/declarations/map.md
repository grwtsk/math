## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c32e2e1857bce55ca3dc8c587a29fb1cf5cc0cbeb80d8e193258cb1458442fd6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 199–208.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def map {β} (f : α → β) : OuterMeasure α →ₗ[ℝ≥0∞] OuterMeasure β where
  toFun m :=
    { measureOf := fun s => m (f ⁻¹' s)
      empty := m.empty
      mono := fun {_ _} h => m.mono (preimage_mono h)
      iUnion_nat := fun s _ => by simpa using measure_iUnion_le fun i => f ⁻¹' s i }
  map_add' _ _ := coe_fn_injective rfl
  map_smul' _ _ := coe_fn_injective rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/MeasureAndIntegration/ClassicalMeasureTheory/OuterMeasureOperations.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Operations/Variantf2cec77449a5c56c5bc2172b6ed4a615265b7bdd88123a9a8717b30828794b11.lean#L199).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9a0ebe363ea3bfad78b5ec3593091bc72b54cec2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
