## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cf85d753-d01c-1b67-8a7e-e68ff9d96723`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 503–522.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem restrict_smul {v : VectorMeasure α M} {i : Set α} (c : R) :
    (c • v).restrict i = c • v.restrict i := by
  by_cases hi : MeasurableSet i
  · ext j hj
    simp [restrict_apply _ hi hj]
  · simp only [restrict_not_measurable _ hi]
    -- `smul_zero` does not work since we do not require `ContinuousAdd`
    ext j
    simp

end

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/MeasureAndIntegration/ClassicalMeasureTheory/VectorMeasureOperationsNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Operations/Variantec09f8fbbf10b30850c9b117b41b8ca51fbf191db097c5ea011d511dcd535384.lean#L503).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9205c48eb761706cc18537e786739a6673faaa89` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
