## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fc48f388-82a5-dfd7-6589-e9a24dbbcffb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma map_const (μ : Measure α) (c : β) : μ.map (fun _ ↦ c) = (μ Set.univ) • dirac c := by
  ext s hs
  simp only [aemeasurable_const, measurable_const, Measure.coe_smul, Pi.smul_apply,
    dirac_apply' _ hs, smul_eq_mul]
  classical
  rw [Measure.map_apply measurable_const hs, Set.preimage_const]
  by_cases hsc : c ∈ s
  · rw [(Set.indicator_eq_one_iff_mem _).mpr hsc, mul_one, if_pos hsc]
  · rw [if_neg hsc, (Set.indicator_eq_zero_iff_notMem _).mpr hsc, measure_empty, mul_zero]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/MeasureAndIntegration/ClassicalMeasureTheory/DiracNamespacedDiracApplyEqZeroOrOne.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Dirac/Variant244166015f806126fffd37c7078692f1bdcd4f8792dbdb349cc733a6aa1abed0.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7a5d46815549975cde2b0a9bb75dcba9091fa811` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
