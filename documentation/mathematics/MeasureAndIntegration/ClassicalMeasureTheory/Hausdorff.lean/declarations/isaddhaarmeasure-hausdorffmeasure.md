## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:41ccd635698c428b56e593d9427af9c443c026ac8048c2316fb3a7cfbd0b8909`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 959–984.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isAddHaarMeasure_hausdorffMeasure {E : Type*}
    [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E] [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]
    [MeasurableSpace E] [BorelSpace E] :
    IsAddHaarMeasure (G := E) μH[finrank ℝ E] where
  lt_top_of_isCompact K hK := by
    set e : E ≃L[ℝ] Fin (finrank ℝ E) → ℝ := ContinuousLinearEquiv.ofFinrankEq (by simp)
    suffices μH[finrank ℝ E] (e '' K) < ⊤ by

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/MeasureAndIntegration/ClassicalMeasureTheory/Hausdorff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Hausdorff/Varianta08d13d7a54e637ce776db7bbb62e36fd30e44abab2ef73a91f25e5d6bf06c50.lean#L959).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3d2ad65c1e4383e93c02ed7834c589c2f4dfd211` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
