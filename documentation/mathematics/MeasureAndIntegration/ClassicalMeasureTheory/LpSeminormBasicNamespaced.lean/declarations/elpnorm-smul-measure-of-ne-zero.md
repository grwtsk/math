## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eba24d54-f665-bba4-eb7d-bc240fbda4a0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 931–935.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma eLpNorm_smul_measure_of_ne_zero' {c : ℝ≥0} (hc : c ≠ 0) (f : α → ε) (p : ℝ≥0∞)
    (μ : Measure α) : eLpNorm f p (c • μ) = c ^ p.toReal⁻¹ • eLpNorm f p μ :=
  (eLpNorm_smul_measure_of_ne_zero (ENNReal.coe_ne_zero.2 hc) ..).trans (by simp; norm_cast)

/-- See `eLpNorm_smul_measure_of_ne_top'` for a version with scalar multiplication by `ℝ≥0`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/MeasureAndIntegration/ClassicalMeasureTheory/LpSeminormBasicNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variantabf7a65373ec7edee45b5e44fd40022eaabc2e89ab38a64b8bea7ccdd4c1e425.lean#L931).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `624840488e6c617cbdb0e982148df08dc075ea6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
