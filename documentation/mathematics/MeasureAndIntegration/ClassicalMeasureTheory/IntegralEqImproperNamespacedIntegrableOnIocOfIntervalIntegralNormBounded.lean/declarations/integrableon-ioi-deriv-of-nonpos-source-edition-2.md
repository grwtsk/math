## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a0129f84-3df7-52fa-38a3-2bc49e4472e1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 775–784.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- When a function has a limit at infinity `l`, and its derivative is nonpositive, then the
integral of the derivative on `(a, +∞)` is `l - g a` (and the derivative is integrable, see
`integrable_on_Ioi_deriv_of_nonneg`). Version assuming differentiability on `(a, +∞)` and
continuity on `[a, +∞)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/MeasureAndIntegration/ClassicalMeasureTheory/IntegralEqImproperNamespacedIntegrableOnIocOfIntervalIntegralNormBounded.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/IntegralEqImproper/Variant440b7e24982813de94bf0b12f74cb8db0865c1d4206a1ae0328711ade0a8b050.lean#L775).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6a4f05e3dd7c9efcde84ecdf1c67e3a6efcd9434` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
