## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e2db9442-2537-301b-91a3-c267c81381f6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 869–875.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem subset_le_of_restrict_le_restrict {i : Set α} (hi : MeasurableSet i) (hi₂ : v ≤[i] w)
    {j : Set α} (hj : j ⊆ i) : v j ≤ w j := by
  by_cases hj₁ : MeasurableSet j
  · exact (restrict_le_restrict_iff _ _ hi).1 hi₂ hj₁ hj
  · rw [v.not_measurable hj₁, w.not_measurable hj₁]
#align measure_theory.vector_measure.subset_le_of_restrict_le_restrict MeasureTheory.VectorMeasure.subset_le_of_restrict_le_restrict

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/MeasureAndIntegration/ClassicalMeasureTheory/VectorMeasure.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/VectorMeasure/Variant580100f6f0205ffe3d1adac1e75d5d1fcadd37155a603c037d173a685bc42f5e.lean#L869).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `694b67575ca73381e86004737d448404da573ca8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
