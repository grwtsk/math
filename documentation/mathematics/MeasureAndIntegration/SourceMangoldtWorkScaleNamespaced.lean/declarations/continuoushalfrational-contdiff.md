## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c72303c-1f1d-13bc-e44b-3f06cadbbf82`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 63–70.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem continuousHalfRational_contDiff : ContDiff ℝ 1 continuousHalfRational := by
  have hn : ContDiff ℝ 1 (fun A : ℝ => -(14 * A ^ 4 + 272 * A ^ 2)) := by fun_prop
  have hd : ContDiff ℝ 1 continuousHalfDenominator := by
    unfold continuousHalfDenominator
    fun_prop
  exact hn.div hd (fun A => ne_of_gt (continuousHalfDenominator_pos A))

/-- The independent rational slope is continuous before any FTC use. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/MeasureAndIntegration/SourceMangoldtWorkScaleNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/25SourceMangoldtWorkScale/Variantb1bfceb87f7b9811d6b64ba30f73c9cd013b12b9edf93d1f641fa5225601d6f4.lean#L63).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `849e4d53f69ea7b60346bd2e409b23ab243207c8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
