## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5b94d048-6517-ac9c-1f97-f584ea05654d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 450–463.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cubic_selected_error_le_coefficient_budget {A : ℝ} (hA : 1 ≤ A)
    (selected : Finset CubicPacket) (hselected : selected ⊆ cubicPacketInventory A) :
    |cubicSourceMoment A -
      ∑ p ∈ selected, cubicPacketWeight p * sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A
        (Real.log (cubicPacketKey p : ℝ))| ≤
      ∑ p ∈ cubicPacketInventory A \ selected, |cubicPacketWeight p| := by
  apply (cubic_selected_error_le_profile_budget hA selected hselected).trans
  apply Finset.sum_le_sum
  intro p _
  exact mul_le_of_le_one_right (abs_nonneg _)
    (EstimateCorrelation.actual_correlation_abs_le_one A _ hA)

/-- The packet moment is exactly the actual signed cubic heat observation at
time zero, under the already constructed probability measure. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/MeasureAndIntegration/SourceMultiplicativePackets.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceMultiplicativePackets/Variant8bc86a07a5dbe888e201154a52ad1875a0f824c33fb38af7b7f8396303e46608.lean#L450).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `82fda8ed57adb6c764d002cdf2324735730ad264` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
