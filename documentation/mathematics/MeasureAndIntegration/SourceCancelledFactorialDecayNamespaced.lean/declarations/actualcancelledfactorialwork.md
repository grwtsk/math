## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:af2d65c0b456cbf60cf50ec774b1d5fa02e6217ec68f03455c5a72aa9afb7fcd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 31–35.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def actualCancelledFactorialWork (A : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ∫ x in Ioi (0 : ℝ), shortFactorialDefect (vaughanCutoff A) x *
    ((1 / 2 : ℝ) * x ^ (-(3 : ℝ) / 2) + deriv (plainProfile A 1) x)

/-- Quantitative logarithmic envelope keeps the complete actual floor cutoff. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/MeasureAndIntegration/SourceCancelledFactorialDecayNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/A0db899c53785655d99eSourceCancelledFactorialDecay/Variant9c94a9e20d00e06fb7192febe2422feeb08083bf328faa33e37c72235ad3c31e.lean#L31).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8112b0758f2e3069200d65013d2b3b65ac3477a0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
