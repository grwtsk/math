## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:da9623b6654c11471cf017e11ff45cdcff08354bc740dfb7d189a977bfa30c67`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 70–80.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def Sigma₁ (x T δ : ℝ) : ℂ :=
  riemannZeta.zeroes_sum (Set.Ico 0 (1 - δ))
    (Set.Ioo (-T) T) (fun ρ ↦ x ^ (ρ - 1) / ρ)

@[blueprint
  "bklnw-sigma_2_def"
  (title := "Definition of Sigma 2")
  (statement := /-- We denote
  $$ \Sigma_2 := \sum_{|\gamma| \leq T;
  \beta \geq 1 - \delta} \frac{x^{\rho - 1}}{\rho} $$
  -/)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/MeasureAndIntegration/BKLNWApp.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/BKLNWApp/Variant202ad4db8f56bf7b19a8bbb3fba44f9bc01fe9e287a208d0ab0df6b7837eaa9d.lean#L70).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d23f277aa57f0df744f827aba10ffe84abca071f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
