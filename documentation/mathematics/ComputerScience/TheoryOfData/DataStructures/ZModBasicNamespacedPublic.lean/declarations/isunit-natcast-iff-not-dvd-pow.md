## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a7e4f27c-e96c-55c0-11d1-45c34c3ece00`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 840–845.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isUnit_natCast_iff_not_dvd_pow {p d a : ℕ} (hp : p.Prime) (hd : 0 < d) :
    IsUnit (a : ZMod (p ^ d)) ↔ ¬ p ∣ a := by
  rw [isUnit_iff_coprime, Nat.coprime_pow_right_iff hd, Nat.coprime_comm,
    hp.coprime_iff_not_dvd]

/-- In `ZMod (p ^ d)` with `0 < d`, the prime `p` is not a unit. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/TheoryOfData/DataStructures/ZModBasicNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variantcec73e2d60a8e9e9298b24a70b7db6af5e08cd7bc31293a58bacff67327c1a55.lean#L840).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c466e569a7d820ea4628e3262dfca74a72dd43b7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
