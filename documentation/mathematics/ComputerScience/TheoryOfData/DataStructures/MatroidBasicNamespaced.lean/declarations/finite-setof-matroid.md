## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3d84583b-2d92-cbce-ea42-880d5bc9528b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1111–1123.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem finite_setOf_matroid {E : Set α} (hE : E.Finite) : {M : Matroid α | M.E ⊆ E}.Finite := by
  set f : Matroid α → Set α × (Set (Set α)) := fun M ↦ ⟨M.E, {B | M.IsBase B}⟩
  have hf : f.Injective := by
    refine fun M M' hMM' ↦ ?_
    rw [Prod.mk.injEq, and_comm, Set.ext_iff, and_comm] at hMM'
    exact ext_isBase hMM'.1 (fun B _ ↦ hMM'.2 B)
  rw [← Set.finite_image_iff hf.injOn]
  refine (hE.finite_subsets.prod hE.finite_subsets.finite_subsets).subset ?_
  rintro _ ⟨M, hE : M.E ⊆ E, rfl⟩
  simp only [Set.mem_prod, Set.mem_setOf_eq, Set.setOf_subset_setOf]
  exact ⟨hE, fun B hB ↦ hB.subset_ground.trans hE⟩

/-- For finite `E`, finitely many matroids have ground set `E`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/TheoryOfData/DataStructures/MatroidBasicNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant7db668a57f773f6b27d1791ad13e20590aad41036a327959d7ac3b7de9ee63b3.lean#L1111).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `074cdae84f92ec170c9370dfe9c5909eeac02301` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
