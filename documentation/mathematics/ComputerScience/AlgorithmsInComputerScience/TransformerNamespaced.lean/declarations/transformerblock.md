## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7cd6098754f41850d332c942fb07d60c9ac1a35e1e539bfc1163e508cb20786b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 922–937.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure TransformerBlock where
  /-- Pre-FFN layer normalization -/
  ln1 : LayerNormParams
  /-- Feed-forward network -/
  ffn : FFNBlock
  /-- Post-FFN layer normalization -/
  ln2 : LayerNormParams
  deriving Repr

namespace TransformerBlock

/-- Forward pass through a Transformer block (without attention).
    Computes: LN2(x + FFN(LN1(x)))

    Note: This is a simplified version without self-attention.
    For full attention, see ML/Optimized/MatrixNetwork.lean -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/AlgorithmsInComputerScience/TransformerNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Transformer/Variantef0b630d6e7b8353b809836621e8e5218f883568b85c4a7d8c47f72edac4ac38.lean#L922).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6fa8ab3d81c90b359f6a21a834b5c2b55a29e904` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
