## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3283439aaa4802ee66cd082f9c121a152b32e0345d0a2e2ecb5dbaf3ff6283ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 122–139.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Slice.takeRight (s : Slice) (n : Nat) : Slice :=
  s.takeEnd n

/--
Creates a string slice that contains the longest prefix of {name}`s` in which {name}`pat` matched
(potentially repeatedly).

This is a cheap operation because it does not allocate a new string to hold the result.
To convert the result into a string, use {name}`String.Slice.copy`.

This function is generic over all currently supported patterns.

Examples:
 * {lean}`"red green blue".takeWhile Char.isLower == "red".toSlice`
 * {lean}`"red green blue".takeWhile 'r' == "r".toSlice`
 * {lean}`"red red green blue".takeWhile "red " == "red red ".toSlice`
 * {lean}`"red green blue".takeWhile (fun (_ : Char) => true) == "red green blue".toSlice`
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/AlgorithmsInComputerScience/TakeDropPublicInternal.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/TakeDrop/Variantc887749e6b430d55629a80355d53ad1632910e95d641fe67f9934869c54cb861.lean#L122).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b55ab71e52840d7b1aabb912149e952207b33104` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
