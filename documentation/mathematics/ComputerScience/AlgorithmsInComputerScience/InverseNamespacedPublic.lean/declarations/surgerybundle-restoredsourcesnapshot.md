## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0c51e75a85f11d8c0150b75dff6943c92dd4f1b35fb4944fb2f6e0288ea684d9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 143–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[expose] def SurgeryBundle.restoredSourceSnapshot
    (bundle : SurgeryBundle) : Option SourceSnapshotModel :=
  match applyObservedEditSequence bundle.afterSnapshot.canonicalSourceBytes
      bundle.inverseObservations bundle.inverseEdits with
  | none => none
  | some bytes => some {
      snapshotHash := bundle.inverseResultSnapshotHash
      repositoryRevision := bundle.inverseResultRepositoryRevision
      canonicalSourceBytes := bytes }

@[surface_novel, surface_published]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/AlgorithmsInComputerScience/InverseNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Inverse/Variant3c520b9880dca6093e9094d742695052db88f0a5c451098338d76b2b6b6b360a.lean#L143).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5ddecc442f59b1132fe728c13c44b5deca58917a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
