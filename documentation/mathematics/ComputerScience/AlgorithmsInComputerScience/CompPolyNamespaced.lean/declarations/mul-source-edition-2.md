## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:368f469e05ee5faa768366a357d8bc31d9f80ec0a9c42df1f4bdc50ea0b1acf0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–109.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mul (p q : DyPoly) (maxBits : Nat := 256) : DyPoly :=
  if p.coeffs.size == 0 || q.coeffs.size == 0 then zero
  else
    let n := p.coeffs.size + q.coeffs.size - 1
    ⟨Array.ofFn (fun k : Fin n =>
      let k' := k.val
      let raw := (List.range (k' + 1)).foldl (fun acc j =>
        if j < p.coeffs.size && k' - j < q.coeffs.size then
          LeanCert.Core.Dyadic.add acc (LeanCert.Core.Dyadic.mul (p.coeff j) (q.coeff (k' - j)))
        else acc) LeanCert.Core.Dyadic.zero
      LeanCert.Core.Dyadic.normalize raw maxBits)⟩

/-- Tail: coefficients with degree > maxDeg. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/AlgorithmsInComputerScience/CompPolyNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/CompPoly/Variant2c20b23ab9e1d2b167c5fafc15d3dd5031cec5e7366eae6547ba0b6c015127e1.lean#L97).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9dd1bd2c5d838d3b9319e05507001cc0df7ad7ef` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
