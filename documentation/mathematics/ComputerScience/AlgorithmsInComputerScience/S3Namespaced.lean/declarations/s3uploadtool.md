## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:08c8aeee527fbd0c1210a9332a918f821f7ca9b9fc2e95998881f915a92450e0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 169–180.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive S3UploadTool where
  | curl
  | rclone
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/--
The transfer tool for an s3 upload: rclone when one works on PATH, curl
otherwise. `forceCurl` (the `MATHLIB_CACHE_PUT_FORCE_CURL` flag) selects curl
regardless.

Pure so the policy is testable; `s3PutStaged` wires the environment in.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/AlgorithmsInComputerScience/S3Namespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/S3/Variantf3f4acdd545965ea1ae45cf50bf1a445560c1eada6824698fbe0d04af073d076.lean#L169).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b0f42d9539309f32ee0c582f667f91c7d869913c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
