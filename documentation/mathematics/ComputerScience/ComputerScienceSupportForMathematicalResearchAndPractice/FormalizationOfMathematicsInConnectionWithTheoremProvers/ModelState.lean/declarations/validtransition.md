## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:958ddc85b446160465fb7cf13109a019a8c49905c1fc5cdfc7d3a98dec7abab3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 28–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ValidTransition (before : State) (intent : Intent) (after : State) : Prop :=
  Invariant before ∧
  intent.scope = before.scope ∧
  intent.baseEpoch = before.epoch ∧
  before.lastEvent < intent.eventId ∧
  0 < intent.routeGap ∧
  intent.evidencePresent = true ∧
  after.epoch = before.epoch + 1 ∧
  after.trace = before.trace + intent.delta ∧
  after.scope = before.scope ∧
  after.lastEvent = intent.eventId ∧
  after.lower = before.lower ∧
  after.upper = before.upper ∧
  Invariant after

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/FormalizationOfMathematicsInConnectionWithTheoremProvers/ModelState.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Model/Varianta3181744e07f61c761108e45636ffedad05cf589a38772af73a1a09fc7995a6d.lean#L28).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a5ff727ffd2d11c288a5288fc37da79509cf40b9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
