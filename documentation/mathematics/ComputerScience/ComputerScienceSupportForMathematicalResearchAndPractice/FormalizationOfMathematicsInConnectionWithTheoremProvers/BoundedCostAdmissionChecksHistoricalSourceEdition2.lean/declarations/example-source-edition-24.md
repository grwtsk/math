## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d2c20ae9f02230c4116eb389473847d3147a7e4d68250900eb18a37d000bb1e7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 170–179.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example (plan expected observed : FrontendCorrespondence.Raw)
    (data : FrontendCorrespondence.ReplayData)
    (accepted : FrontendCorrespondence.rawCheck plan expected observed data = true) :
    ∃ planTree expectedTree observedTree,
      FrontendCorrespondence.decode plan = some planTree ∧
      FrontendCorrespondence.decode expected = some expectedTree ∧
      FrontendCorrespondence.decode observed = some observedTree ∧
      FrontendCorrespondence.project planTree expectedTree observedTree = some data :=
  FrontendCorrespondence.rawCheck_projection_exact accepted

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/FormalizationOfMathematicsInConnectionWithTheoremProvers/BoundedCostAdmissionChecksHistoricalSourceEdition2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/PipelineResourceContracts/Variant4fe3e71b2ec0739724b05c72eea8965a37378a23d6dfc31124945e2680a9aa89.lean#L170).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5058555d596397f394c65684ff6d0f93fdcbab41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
