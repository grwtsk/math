## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8c580830ad67cfa94a6205fadb888c1c60560647b66211f72f9818545b2c8cb1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure BoundVerifyResult where
  /-- Whether the bound was verified -/
  verified : Bool
  /-- The computed bound (lo for min, hi for max) -/
  computedBound : ℚ
  /-- Approximate argmin/argmax (midpoint of best box) -/
  witness : WitnessPoint
  /-- Width of the best box (epsilon for ε-approximate argmin/argmax) -/
  epsilon : ℚ
  /-- Number of iterations used -/
  iterations : Nat
  deriving Repr

/-- Extract witness point from a box (midpoint of each interval) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/FormalizationOfMathematicsInConnectionWithTheoremProvers/BoundVerifyNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/BoundVerify/Variantb00fd6792d2566ca86293741dcd17d80679cd9714859817c0be394b6f3fd4f11.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `063041f9a13dbbb802987ada3c7e9e9a13976777` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
