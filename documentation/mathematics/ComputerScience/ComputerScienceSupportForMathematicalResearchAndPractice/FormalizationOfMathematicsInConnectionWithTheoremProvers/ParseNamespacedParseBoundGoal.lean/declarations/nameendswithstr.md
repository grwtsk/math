## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0c0d22be1ee7eb75f6fcfe597d1738fd8a1a4ff4b99f8f5a4d32ee61e2a0b1b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 647–655.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def nameEndsWithStr (n : Lean.Name) (suffix : String) : Bool :=
  match n with
  | .str _ s => s == suffix || s.endsWith ("." ++ suffix)
  | _ => false

/-- Parse a point inequality goal and extract lhs, rhs, and inequality type.
    Returns (lhs, rhs, isStrict, isReversed) where:
    - isStrict: true for < or >, false for ≤ or ≥
    - isReversed: true for ≥ or > (need to flip the comparison) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/FormalizationOfMathematicsInConnectionWithTheoremProvers/ParseNamespacedParseBoundGoal.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Parse/Variant64285f6159d1d850ee5ba515217d6e79bf5fd1260118c408b01a64d5346dbaee.lean#L647).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6c77d081b41121bbdfbdc8e2ced4bf5e22fea306` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
