## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6f50d4746aa9b5dfb6eaf821733726b9a61917265b9919a821919628d66f7796`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 16–31.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure CertifiedIntervalTheorem
    {Input : Type uInput} {Witness : Type uWitness}
    (profile : IntervalProfile Input Witness) where
  theoremArtifact : ArtifactRef .theoremArtifact
  proofArtifact : ArtifactRef .theoremProof
  formalDeclaration : ArtifactRef .formalDeclaration
  kernelBuildEvidence : ArtifactRef .kernelBuildEvidence
  assumptionSet : ArtifactRef .assumptionSet
  theoremArtifactExact : theoremArtifact = profile.sourceTheorem
  assumptionSetExact : assumptionSet = profile.assumptionSet
  claim : IntervalClaim profile

/--
`refined` proves at least what `broader` asks on the latter's declared scope.
The domain and admissibility transports are explicit proof fields.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/FormalizationOfMathematicsInConnectionWithTheoremProvers/TheoremNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Theorem/Variant0131371712122c10f20d86e9e9d0775fe0278c3d29204914676e934ad01a03fb.lean#L16).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d4a5ae036cc170a9cc25fb40cf8b1b40498e3154` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
