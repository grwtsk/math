## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:61c0d617-231a-8bab-0abf-f19c3e9b8fcf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 345–357.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem growth_path (hw : SystemWeaklyNormalizing P) {T : Expr S} {s : S}
    (hT : HasType P Γ T (.sort s)) (hΔ : ValidContext P Δ) (σ : Nat → Expr S)
    (hσ : TypedSubstitution P Γ Δ σ) :
    PositivePath (PrimaryEdge P) (Profile P Δ (T.subst σ)) (Profile P Γ T) := by
  have ht := hT.subst hΔ σ hσ
  exact inclusion_path (feasible (ht.weaklyNormalizing hw) (nonempty_of_sorted hw ht))
    (feasible (hT.weaklyNormalizing hw) (nonempty_of_sorted hw hT))
    (growth hw (hT.weaklyNormalizing hw) hΔ σ hσ)
end Profile

/-- Context conversion as exact equality of all judgments on unchanged
syntax. Both contexts are required valid. This auxiliary relation carries
no semantic or normalization assumption. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/FormalizationOfMathematicsInConnectionWithTheoremProvers/PotentialEdition1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Potential/Variant0d451abb503d9b846379268c2b8621f9d2337d57dc14bb19fd7fa882d31013a5.lean#L345).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2e1a55517e60d102cb4397d4882ff100b98272e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
