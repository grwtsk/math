## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:706040828a0098778b4fa69387f4363ec68fdfcd6504b2183751f17b36866b78`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 296–319.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def updateAndMaterializeDep
  (ws : Workspace) (pkg : Package) (dep : Dependency)
: UpdateT LoggerIO MaterializedDep := do
  if let some entry ← fetch? dep.name then
    entry.materialize ws.lakeEnv ws.dir ws.relPkgsDir
  else
    let inherited := !pkg.isRoot
    /-
    NOTE: A path dependency inherited from another dependency's manifest
    will always be of the form a `./<relPath>` (i.e., be relative to its
    workspace).  Thus, when relativized to this workspace, it will have the
    path  `<relPkgDir>/./<relPath>`. However, if defining dependency lacks
    a manifest, it will instead be locked as `<relPkgDir>/<relPath>`.
    Adding a `.` here eliminates this difference.
    -/
    let relPkgDir := if pkg.relDir == "." then pkg.relDir else pkg.relDir / "."
    let matDep ← dep.materialize inherited ws.lakeEnv ws.dir ws.relPkgsDir relPkgDir
    store matDep.name matDep.manifestEntry
    return matDep

/--
Exit code returned if Lake needs a manual restart.
Used, for instance, if the toolchain is updated and no Elan is detected.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/FormalizationOfMathematicsInConnectionWithTheoremProvers/ResolveNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Resolve/Variant9c8d3a0c27b06e650ba643bc6a4b82373ba572da051b3b33e516b4014ff0d2f1.lean#L296).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `65f8fed0afd70a439a4e611a1d9aa029e0f7f523` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
