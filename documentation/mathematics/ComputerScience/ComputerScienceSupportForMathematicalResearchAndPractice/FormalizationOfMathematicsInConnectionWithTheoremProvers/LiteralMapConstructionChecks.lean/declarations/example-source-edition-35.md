## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:afc681c3e4de39886e088612d5776e3a47a8db265bae410802cd8fe3219a05b1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 992–1000.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example (roots : TransactionConstruction.Roots) (archive : Files Record)
    (actions : List TransactionConstruction.RoutedAction) (area : Area)
    (files : Files Record) (writes : Files TransactionConstruction.WriteSource)
    (archiveUnique : unique archive) (fileUnique : unique files)
    (success : TransactionConstruction.constructWrites roots archive actions area files = .ok writes) :
    (files.map Prod.fst).Perm (writes.map Prod.fst) :=
  TransactionConstruction.constructWrites_success_exact_keys roots archive actions area files writes
    archiveUnique fileUnique success

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/FormalizationOfMathematicsInConnectionWithTheoremProvers/LiteralMapConstructionChecks.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ProofEvidence/IndependentConsumers/Checks/Positive/LiteralMapConstructionChecks.lean#L992).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d6481ff83b219593606c6ae1ea8ffacfe858fa6a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
