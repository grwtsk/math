## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0d8b2c7d-1268-c81e-2eb6-fb3d07c3e308`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 442–453.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem payload_preserving_routes_are_path_independent
    {Host EdgeId Payload : Type*}
    (transport : OrderedRoute Host EdgeId → Payload → Payload)
    (payloadPreserving : RoutePayloadPreserving transport) :
    RoutePathIndependent transport := by
  intro left right payload
  rw [payloadPreserving left payload, payloadPreserving right payload]

/-- A genuinely path-dependent edge-transforming transport cannot obtain the
same-value route convergence conclusion from this package.  A confluence (or
equivalent path-independence) proof must be supplied separately. -/
@[surface_novel, surface_published]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/FormalizationOfMathematicsInConnectionWithTheoremProvers/ConvergencePublicEdition2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Convergence/Variant416520a9d526936840fe2f831e4a236afdb98b1c69f517217e250f62b0349320.lean#L442).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4dd37a070b570a031eac069e50dc13c83c091e85` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
