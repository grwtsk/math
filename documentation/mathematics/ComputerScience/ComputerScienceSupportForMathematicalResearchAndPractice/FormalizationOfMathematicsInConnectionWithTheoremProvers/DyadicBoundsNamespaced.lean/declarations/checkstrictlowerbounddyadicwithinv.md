## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1a9883c60ab3bc8e39506feed15088ae08eb4e64b27348a8dc1951674aa1ba71`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 323–336.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def checkStrictLowerBoundDyadicWithInv (e : Expr) (lo hi : ℚ) (hle : lo ≤ hi) (c : ℚ)
    (prec : Int) (depth : Nat) : Bool :=
  let I_rat : IntervalRat := ⟨lo, hi, hle⟩
  let ρ := fun _ => IntervalDyadic.ofIntervalRat I_rat prec
  let cfg : DyadicConfig := { precision := prec, taylorDepth := depth }
  checkDomainValidDyadic e ρ cfg &&
    decide (c < (evalIntervalDyadic e ρ cfg).lo.toRat)

/-! ### WithInv Golden Theorems

For `ExprSupportedWithInv` expressions (with inv/log). Domain validity is extracted
from the combined check function, so no separate `hdom` argument is needed. -/

/-- Golden Theorem for Dyadic upper bounds with inv/log expressions. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/FormalizationOfMathematicsInConnectionWithTheoremProvers/DyadicBoundsNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DyadicBounds/Variant127d246bf898633dbc68c2ceed49d1efe55aecf2b36c082ddc7ade92e6356911.lean#L323).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `87ff56dd51f8cbb6731e5802861c2ca3d107018b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
