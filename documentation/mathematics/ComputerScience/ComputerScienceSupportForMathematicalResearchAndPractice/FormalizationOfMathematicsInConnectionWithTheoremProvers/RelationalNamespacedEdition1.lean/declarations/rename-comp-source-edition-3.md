## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0d38cb70-7bf2-aacd-9e63-c02e333adad1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1801–1802.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rename_comp (ρ τ : Nat → Nat) : (R.rename τ).rename ρ = R.rename (ρ ∘ τ) := by
  cases R; simp only [rename,DataWrapper.rename_comp,DoubleCode.rename_comp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/FormalizationOfMathematicsInConnectionWithTheoremProvers/RelationalNamespacedEdition1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Relational/Variant8edb56fe6c7be28541fccc7bc1ea48886164f4e6c1203f2828d1a97c54ad8c17.lean#L1801).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb5308e58a192243c9ef3819c0de9f0fe25857f4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
