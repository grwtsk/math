## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2fed4263-dba6-50ac-bba7-74b912676b75`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 748–755.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem featureBody_rename (L : LogicCode S) (KY KP : QuantifierCode S) (f :
  ObservationFeature S) (ρ : Nat → Nat) :
    (B.featureBody L KY KP f).rename (Expr.liftRen ρ) = (B.rename ρ).featureBody (L.rename ρ)
      (KY.rename ρ) (KP.rename ρ) (f.rename ρ) := by
  simp only [featureBody,feature_rename,rename_comp,LogicCode.rename_comp,
    QuantifierCode.rename_comp,ObservationFeature.rename_comp,
    Expr.rename,Expr.liftRen,PureTypeSystem.Expr.liftRen]
  rfl
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/FormalizationOfMathematicsInConnectionWithTheoremProvers/EquivalenceEdition1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Equivalence/Variant6abd4e49279ecab078571e65964b6dc5b36fb8aeb40fb1b25185bfc9c2a6469b.lean#L748).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `080545f485bd6f356ed655974b18733359d13535` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
