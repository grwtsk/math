## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c4ecd38bff3b58ed1aa926309840e4ae5bd0cf0f5bd0527708ec2cb0ad81b803`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1355–1368.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkAppStx (name : Ident) (args : TSyntaxArray `doc_arg) : DocM Term := do
  return ⟨mkNode ``Parser.Term.app #[name, mkNullNode (← args.mapM mkArg)]⟩

/--
If `true`, suggestions are provided for code elements.
-/
register_builtin_option doc.verso.suggestions : Bool := {
  defValue := true
  descr := "whether to provide suggestions for code elements"
}

-- Normally, name suggestions should be provided relative to the current scope. But
-- during bootstrapping, the names in question may not yet be defined, so builtin
-- names need special handling.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/TheoremProvingAutomatedAndInteractiveTheoremProversDeductionResolutionEtc/DocStringNamespacedPublicElabLink.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DocString/Variant2a0f3acd24e8c078943449753b171432ae90b688ca805c7e325b16f929597137.lean#L1355).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `014689ae16d0f21928edb8900d54e926c7b9471b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
