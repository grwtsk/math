## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:601ea3fd00e74d76fcb16379b2a6707c8adcadcd3dd61699ea36193853db5052`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 558–572.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def changeNumeral : Expr → Expr
  | .lit (.natVal 1) => mkRawNatLit 0
  | e                => e

/--
`applyReplacementFun e` replaces the expression `e` with its additive counterpart.
It translates each identifier (inductive type, defined function etc) in an expression, unless
* The identifier occurs in an application with first argument `arg`; and
* `test arg` is false.
However, if `f` is in the dictionary `relevant`, then the argument `relevant.find f`
is tested, instead of the first argument.

It will also reorder arguments of certain functions, using `reorderFn`:
e.g. `g x₁ x₂ x₃ ... xₙ` becomes `g x₂ x₁ x₃ ... xₙ` if `reorderFn g = some [1]`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/TheoremProvingAutomatedAndInteractiveTheoremProversDeductionResolutionEtc/ToAdditiveFrontend.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Variant069edb532fdb4833e6c83256f30f5ec3898bb973909c8ea7ad3005473a0c26de.lean#L558).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `68138ccfe54e8c7a4fe4d54f67af05cfcc444fe2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
