## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4b1fac01416dcce81d06da2c04ac043477a0cd3ef12e6506efe28b89c826bb7e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 182–190.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ScopedEnvExtension.addScopedEntry (ext : ScopedEnvExtension α β σ) (env : Environment) (namespaceName : Name) (b : β) : Environment :=
  ext.ext.addEntry env (Entry.«scoped» namespaceName b)

/-- The following function is used to implement `end_local_scope` command.

By default, all states have `delimitsLocal` set to `true`, and the following code modifies only the top element of the stack.
If the top element’s `delimitsLocal` is `false`, the function instead traverses down the stack until it reaches the first state where `delimitsLocal` is `true`.
Intuitively, `delimitsLocal` of each `State` determines whether local entries are delimited. When set to false, it allows traversal through implicit scopes where local entries are not delimited.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/TheoremProvingAutomatedAndInteractiveTheoremProversDeductionResolutionEtc/ScopedEnvExtensionNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ScopedEnvExtension/Variant37cf77f92ed092fa3f878a6e6686fcdd54714b38566c76d4cd9f6d7eb33c6a60.lean#L182).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7daa278ba4831843aa1fd060dfa2bd5dfb9b6b72` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
