## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a0430f11df80ddb06a177ffc93cf44ad1019bb171e83b919eccb425d8d914b2b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 701–741.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure FS.Stream where
  /--
  Flushes the stream's output buffers.
  -/
  flush   : IO Unit
  /--
  Reads up to the given number of bytes from the stream.

  If the returned array is empty, an end-of-file marker (EOF) has been reached. An EOF does not
  actually close a stream, so further reads may block and return more data.
  -/
  read    : USize → IO ByteArray
  /--
  Writes the provided bytes to the stream.

  If the stream represents a physical output device such as a file on disk, then the results may be
  buffered. Call `FS.Stream.flush` to synchronize their contents.
  -/
  write   : ByteArray → IO Unit
  /--
  Reads text up to and including the next newline from the stream.

  If the returned string is empty, an end-of-file marker (EOF) has been reached.
  An EOF does not actually close a stream, so further reads may block and return more data.
  -/
  getLine : IO String
  /--
  Writes the provided string to the stream.
  -/
  putStr  : String → IO Unit
  /-- Returns `true` if a stream refers to a Windows console or Unix terminal. -/
  isTty   : BaseIO Bool
  deriving Inhabited

open FS

/--
Returns the current thread's standard input stream.

Use `IO.setStdin` to replace the current thread's standard input stream.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/TheoremProvingAutomatedAndInteractiveTheoremProversDeductionResolutionEtc/IOPublicBaseIO.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/IO/Variant4612b91e65806364c814fc445b35598d8e26ee0f2a811ffde6c330d792dcddab.lean#L701).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `64faef771c3b33af437dde294e5472dced69f6a5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
