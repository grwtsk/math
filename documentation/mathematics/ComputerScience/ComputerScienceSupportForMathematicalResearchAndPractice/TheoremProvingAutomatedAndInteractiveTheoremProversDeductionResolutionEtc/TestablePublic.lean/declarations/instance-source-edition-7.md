## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8895affefedaf327a3491556127244502d03754285855d2742ffdf9829ff7bb8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 437–447.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := high) unusedVarTestable {β : Prop} [Nonempty α] [Testable β] :
  Testable (NamedBinder var (α → β))
where
  run := fun cfg min => do
    if cfg.traceDiscarded || cfg.traceSuccesses then
      slimTrace s!"{var} is unused"
    let r ← Testable.runProp β cfg min
    let finalR := addInfo s!"{var} is irrelevant (unused)" id r
    return imp (· <| Classical.ofNonempty) finalR (PSum.inr <| fun x _ => x)

universe u in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/ComputerScienceSupportForMathematicalResearchAndPractice/TheoremProvingAutomatedAndInteractiveTheoremProversDeductionResolutionEtc/TestablePublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Testable/Variantfc59d63224694413b0b82de025be4323c3ed66aee81843092342cb69cb59a5b1.lean#L437).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2d1002d88aa1254808abe640d1bc68bfa0222afb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
