## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:036afeaf9079d0fa45e286681654d4d776bf84495536364ea3fccacbb14ee657`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 706–709.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def alter (t : Raw α β cmp) (a : α) (f : Option β → Option β) : Raw α β cmp :=
  letI : Ord α := ⟨cmp⟩; ⟨Impl.Const.alter! a f t.inner⟩

@[inline, inherit_doc DTreeMap.Const.mergeWith]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/TheoryOfSoftware/FunctionalProgrammingAndLambdaCalculus/BasicBasicNamespacedPublicEdition17.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variante901de23939a38c9f992493fc71ae7ec9b6e92c3509ac9cad11a4108669736e1.lean#L706).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1c27d727b9f58316fffa03898d445571b3b8c71c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
