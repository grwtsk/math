## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:26ea64b6d8e5a7c1294c38e54ba97bff4d838b66c6a1f4c52f73f7cc34b2a78d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 24–37.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[ext] structure Rat where
  /-- Constructs a rational number from components.
  We rename the constructor to `mk'` to avoid a clash with the smart constructor. -/
  mk' ::
  /-- The numerator of the rational number is an integer. -/
  num : Int
  /-- The denominator of the rational number is a natural number. -/
  den : Nat := 1
  /-- The denominator is nonzero. -/
  den_nz : den ≠ 0 := by decide
  /-- The numerator and denominator are coprime: it is in "reduced form". -/
  reduced : num.natAbs.Coprime den := by decide
  deriving DecidableEq

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/TheoryOfSoftware/FunctionalProgrammingAndLambdaCalculus/BasicBasicNamespacedEdition3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variantec482a279158b29bab33f3332e668ca57d88c347297357ba0eadbef9861ca730.lean#L24).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7319586d97788d271e343f61c2037f50e82e80dc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
