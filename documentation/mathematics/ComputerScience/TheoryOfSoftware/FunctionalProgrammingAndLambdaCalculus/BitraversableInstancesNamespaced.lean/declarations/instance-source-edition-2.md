## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f2fb584a05be35005b28b7d153aa2919fc1efe36971f979d7baa88da1916eeec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 145–152.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [LawfulTraversable F] [LawfulBitraversable t] : LawfulBitraversable (bicompr F t) := by
  constructor <;> intros <;>
    simp [bitraverse, Bicompr.bitraverse, bitraverse_id_id, functor_norm]
  · simp only [bitraverse_eq_bimap_id', traverse_eq_map_id', Function.comp_apply, Id.pure_eq]; rfl
  · dsimp only [bicompr]
    simp [naturality, binaturality']

end Bicompr
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/ComputerScience/TheoryOfSoftware/FunctionalProgrammingAndLambdaCalculus/BitraversableInstancesNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Instances/Variantd076be6379b6dd81709d34a24ea25a2c5d673d3fc104a8f69b5827f805efa444.lean#L145).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `59235631efff83499065bfaab7b8933a0569fad2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
