## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:267e330b-2dc5-898f-5eb7-379aeb6963dc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 174–184.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ae_forall_image_mem_imp_frequently_image_mem (hf : Conservative f μ)
    (hs : NullMeasurableSet s μ) : ∀ᵐ x ∂μ, ∀ k, f^[k] x ∈ s → ∃ᶠ n in atTop, f^[n] x ∈ s := by
  refine ae_all_iff.2 fun k => ?_
  refine (hf.ae_mem_imp_frequently_image_mem
    (hs.preimage <| hf.toQuasiMeasurePreserving.iterate k)).mono fun x hx hk => ?_
  rw [← map_add_atTop_eq_nat k, frequently_map]
  refine (hx hk).mono fun n hn => ?_
  rwa [add_comm, iterate_add_apply]

/-- If `f` is a conservative self-map and `s` is a measurable set of positive measure, then
`ae μ`-frequently we have `x ∈ s` and `s` returns to `s` under infinitely many iterations of `f`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/DynamicalSystemsAndErgodicTheory/ConservativeOfAbsolutelyContinuous.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Conservative/Variant5c0aaa21b124508d998e77b8ba4ff63c6f7385889b4f3aac2629c8e803da7330.lean#L174).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `10c5678c640d3c5cce5f59b1e3160b12305bad2c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
