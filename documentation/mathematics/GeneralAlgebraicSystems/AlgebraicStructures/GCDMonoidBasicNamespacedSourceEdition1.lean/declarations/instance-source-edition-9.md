## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:297d93c40da2f070c0bb5488bb21126cdaf536631b4d8ef1c584320be74bcdcb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 488–499.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [h : Nonempty (GCDMonoid α)] : DecompositionMonoid α where
  primal k m n H := by
    cases h
    by_cases h0 : gcd k m = 0
    · rw [gcd_eq_zero_iff] at h0
      rcases h0 with ⟨rfl, rfl⟩
      exact ⟨0, n, dvd_refl 0, dvd_refl n, by simp⟩
    · obtain ⟨a, ha⟩ := gcd_dvd_left k m
      refine ⟨gcd k m, a, gcd_dvd_right _ _, ?_, ha⟩
      rw [← mul_dvd_mul_iff_left h0, ← ha]
      exact dvd_gcd_mul_of_dvd_mul H

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/GeneralAlgebraicSystems/AlgebraicStructures/GCDMonoidBasicNamespacedSourceEdition1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant7b73e08586066af0e75003ae12a781d19ce90ea4e2d084420b717994d40f363e.lean#L488).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5bd393597fdb26b189614093565aba54ead9d1d7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
