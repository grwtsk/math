## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:150606c2c86bd141bdda265b091b5d3fb8e32686466f62d1de0746c90a98e821`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 380–389.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def invertibleOfInvertibleMul (a b : α) [Invertible a] [Invertible (a * b)] : Invertible b where
  invOf := ⅟ (a * b) * a
  invOf_mul_self := by rw [mul_assoc, invOf_mul_self]
  mul_invOf_self := by
    rw [← (isUnit_of_invertible a).mul_right_inj, ← mul_assoc, ← mul_assoc, mul_invOf_self, mul_one,
      one_mul]
#align invertible_of_invertible_mul invertibleOfInvertibleMul

/-- This is the `Invertible` version of `Units.isUnit_mul_units` -/
@[reducible]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/GeneralAlgebraicSystems/AlgebraicStructures/AlgebraInvertible.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Invertible/Variant51e43200ef30372e64da6c62677099327e071abafd693d58183316d3acb20935.lean#L380).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `21fe723083a096a9b7bbf21a2b3a1842ab8be580` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
