## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8c977181-3554-1db4-a609-de978a39b181`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 430–434.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_leftInverse {f : R →+* S₁} {g : S₁ →+* R} (hf : Function.LeftInverse f g) :
    Function.LeftInverse (map f : MvPolynomial σ R → MvPolynomial σ S₁) (map g) := fun X => by
  rw [map_map, (RingHom.ext hf : f.comp g = RingHom.id _), map_id]

/-- If `f` is a right-inverse of `g` then `map f` is a right-inverse of `map g`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/GeneralAlgebraicSystems/AlgebraicStructures/MvPolynomialEvalNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Eval/Variant4be1d19cce04d3996fde58ecd72fc92cdcb88b229663d19c919556d0ad11c72b.lean#L430).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e3415bd1944628128bec1d8d3f86e52132e60427` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
