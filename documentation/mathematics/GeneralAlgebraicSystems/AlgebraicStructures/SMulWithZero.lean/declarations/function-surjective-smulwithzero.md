## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a83020762994961ef85395b40461fe98d66809141904b111a01067780e304e50`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 101–113.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def Function.Surjective.smulWithZero (f : ZeroHom M M') (hf : Function.Surjective f)
    (smul : ∀ (a : R) (b), f (a • b) = a • f b) :
    SMulWithZero R M' where
  smul := (· • ·)
  zero_smul m := by
    rcases hf m with ⟨x, rfl⟩
    simp [← smul]
  smul_zero c := by rw [←f.map_zero, ←smul, smul_zero]
#align function.surjective.smul_with_zero Function.Surjective.smulWithZero

variable (M)

/-- Compose a `SMulWithZero` with a `ZeroHom`, with action `f r' • m` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/GeneralAlgebraicSystems/AlgebraicStructures/SMulWithZero.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/SMulWithZero/Variantb8d654f4802f3aa8a150df6ef5fa15c61c7517175af9603e17960feba47b3103.lean#L101).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e02df180a9118837e67f31eae886909c6a88ecba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
