## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b19a2bcd-e68a-5c09-787f-c17b60c0b501`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 330–333.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma mul_eq_of_eq_mul_inv₀ (ha : a ≠ 0) (h : a = c * b⁻¹) : a * b = c := by
  rwa [← eq_mul_inv_iff_mul_eq₀]; rintro rfl; simp [ha] at h

/-- A variant of `eq_inv_mul_iff_mul_eq₀` that moves the nonzero hypothesis to another variable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/GeneralAlgebraicSystems/AlgebraicStructures/UnitsBasicNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variante1c3f905c174a0f9e64510dbba07f1fdbd4d300489a1b0800f59589c579a0c15.lean#L330).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a28e9153e24169504b6c11588408ad39d10d44f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
