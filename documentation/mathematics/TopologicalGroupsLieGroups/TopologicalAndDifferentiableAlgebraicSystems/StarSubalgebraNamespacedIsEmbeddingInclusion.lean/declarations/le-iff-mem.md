## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3111ae7c-7f32-8a81-02d3-fae5436ab8b3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 233–240.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem le_iff_mem {x : A} {s : StarSubalgebra R A} (hs : IsClosed (s : Set A)) :
    elemental R x ≤ s ↔ x ∈ s :=
  ⟨fun h ↦ h (self_mem R x), fun h ↦ le_of_mem hs h⟩

@[deprecated (since := "2024-11-05")]
alias _root_.elementalStarAlgebra.le_of_isClosed_of_mem := le_of_mem

/-- The coercion from an elemental algebra to the full algebra as a `IsClosedEmbedding`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/TopologicalGroupsLieGroups/TopologicalAndDifferentiableAlgebraicSystems/StarSubalgebraNamespacedIsEmbeddingInclusion.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/StarSubalgebra/Variant10b02717940481dfa8e9d602a2d8b2063eddd2bd397bb103ab79d7db4497d1d5.lean#L233).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8040d9627a20bad11789bc52ede18d77dfbe7abc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
