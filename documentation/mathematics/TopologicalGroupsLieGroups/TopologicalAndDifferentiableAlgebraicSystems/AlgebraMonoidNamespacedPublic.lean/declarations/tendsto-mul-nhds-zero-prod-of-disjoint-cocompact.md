## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:07e34a9a-a349-1fa4-984a-ba5a902eea01`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 466–476.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_mul_nhds_zero_prod_of_disjoint_cocompact {l : Filter M}
    (hl : Disjoint l (cocompact M)) :
    Tendsto (fun x : M × M ↦ x.1 * x.2) (𝓝 0 ×ˢ l) (𝓝 0) := calc
  map (fun x : M × M ↦ x.1 * x.2) (𝓝 0 ×ˢ l)
  _ ≤ map (fun x : M × M ↦ x.1 * x.2) (𝓝ˢ ({0} ×ˢ Set.univ)) :=
    map_mono <| nhds_prod_le_of_disjoint_cocompact 0 hl
  _ ≤ 𝓝 0 := continuous_mul.tendsto_nhdsSet_nhds fun _ ⟨hx, _⟩ ↦ mul_eq_zero_of_left hx _

/-- Let `M` be a topological space with a continuous multiplication operation and a `0`.
Let `l` be a filter on `M` which is disjoint from the cocompact filter. Then, the multiplication map
`M × M → M` tends to zero on the filter product `l ×ˢ 𝓝 0`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/TopologicalGroupsLieGroups/TopologicalAndDifferentiableAlgebraicSystems/AlgebraMonoidNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Monoid/Varianta469478f410b3f72e3a98ef92475f885054db1464983b4a21fd422c9891f2b1d.lean#L466).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7e97bd3384a24c3b0ffdafc711bd1ca099d124af` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
