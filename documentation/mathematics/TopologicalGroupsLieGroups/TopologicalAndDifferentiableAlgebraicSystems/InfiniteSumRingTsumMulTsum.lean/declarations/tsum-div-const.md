## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c8248489-e6b4-ca14-c6f4-71ece8860ee7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 127–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tsum_div_const [T2Space α] : ∑' x, f x / a = (∑' x, f x) / a := by
  simpa only [div_eq_mul_inv] using tsum_mul_right

### Multipliying two infinite sums

In this section, we prove various results about `(∑' x : ι, f x) * (∑' y : κ, g y)`. Note that we
always assume that the family `λ x : ι × κ, f x.1 * g x.2` is summable, since there is no way to
deduce this from the summabilities of `f` and `g` in general, but if you are working in a normed
space, you may want to use the analogous lemmas in `Analysis/NormedSpace/Basic`
(e.g `tsum_mul_tsum_of_summable_norm`).

We first establish results about arbitrary index types, `ι` and `κ`, and then we specialize to
`ι = κ = ℕ` to prove the Cauchy product formula (see `tsum_mul_tsum_eq_tsum_sum_antidiagonal`).

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/TopologicalGroupsLieGroups/TopologicalAndDifferentiableAlgebraicSystems/InfiniteSumRingTsumMulTsum.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Ring/Variant8bf1f2a5aecaf8f7fdbb7dfd0c60bb605120d4d408b52981d93e1dc6a6aab5be.lean#L127).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5e4522deae7aa431473a77b1414e1cea2f787300` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
