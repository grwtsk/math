## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a80ee9fc-0867-1900-58f5-50a464c300bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 382–387.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem comp_f {S₁ S₂ S₃ : Split C} (Φ₁₂ : S₁ ⟶ S₂) (Φ₂₃ : S₂ ⟶ S₃) (n : ℕ) :
    (Φ₁₂ ≫ Φ₂₃).f n = Φ₁₂.f n ≫ Φ₂₃.f n :=
  rfl

-- This is not a `@[simp]` lemma as it can later be proved by `simp`.
@[reassoc]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/AlgebraicTopology/SplitNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Split/Variantc7591ac5912776e7631b668aa4b8253daca72c6865c7728f80cc922354428b7c.lean#L382).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3de7e1d3eb2747270cc5937d5cbc1dddf2ad4d5d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
