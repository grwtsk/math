## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5fb3cf799280d82ddcbd6ab8e34c7336954f419c17482efe75f38d42633c3a1b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1165–1177.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Submonoid.faithfulSMul {M' α : Type*} [MulOneClass M'] [SMul M' α] {S : Submonoid M'}
    [FaithfulSMul M' α] : FaithfulSMul S α :=
  ⟨fun h => Subtype.ext <| eq_of_smul_eq_smul h⟩

section Units

namespace Submonoid

set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false in
/-- The multiplicative equivalence between the type of units of `M` and the submonoid of unit
elements of `M`. -/
@[to_additive (attr := simps!) /-- The additive equivalence between the type of additive units of
`M` and the additive submonoid whose elements are the additive units of `M`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GroupTheoryAndGeneralizations/GroupSubmonoidOperationsNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Operations/Variant3f29a54a9a6089ddb99c5177597e30972cd6a999e762ec5068219b133622566f.lean#L1165).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
