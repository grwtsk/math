## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:debef6d4d088cf68da0f8c196c31acc5c01661993a789fc78322fd53d06fae80`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 627–635.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def quotientEquivOfEq (h : s = t) : α ⧸ s ≃ α ⧸ t
    where
  toFun := Quotient.map' id fun _a _b h' => h ▸ h'
  invFun := Quotient.map' id fun _a _b h' => h.symm ▸ h'
  left_inv q := induction_on' q fun _g => rfl
  right_inv q := induction_on' q fun _g => rfl
#align subgroup.quotient_equiv_of_eq Subgroup.quotientEquivOfEq
#align add_subgroup.quotient_equiv_of_eq AddSubgroup.quotientEquivOfEq

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GroupTheoryAndGeneralizations/Coset.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Coset/Variant61b268f9dcc1c57462d3a0a088e1f8443256ebaca032a325aefa62a08ed31dc7.lean#L627).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6f0dc57e1d8d59761ae0a61c675061a3fa4caae3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
