## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e595f460-dea3-3cc6-bce3-81873df440ad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 860–870.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mk'_ker : ker c.mk' = c :=
  ext fun _ _ => c.eq
#align con.mk'_ker Con.mk'_ker
#align add_con.mk'_ker AddCon.mk'_ker

variable {c}

/-- The natural homomorphism from a monoid to its quotient by a congruence relation is
    surjective. -/
@[to_additive "The natural homomorphism from an `AddMonoid` to its quotient by a congruence
relation is surjective."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GroupTheoryAndGeneralizations/CongruenceNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Congruence/Variant77d752fd351994905fc3663ab608f3f133b2da45b429d1223d8db3e563ef4742.lean#L860).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8acb840ce4dc2000854f00befb54e57293eb7fe4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
