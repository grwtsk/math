## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:eb359d6d19a8b5b3333feba3a94988dc34f450f7337d5aff59aa46a25041843d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 257–269.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance fintypeMrange {M N : Type*} [Monoid M] [Monoid N] [Fintype M] [DecidableEq N]
    (f : M →* N) : Fintype (mrange f) :=
  Set.fintypeRange f

/-- The range of a finite group under a group homomorphism is finite.

Note: this instance can form a diamond with `Subtype.fintype` or `Subgroup.fintype` in the
presence of `Fintype N`. -/
@[to_additive
/-- The range of a finite additive group under an additive group homomorphism is finite.

Note: this instance can form a diamond with `Subtype.fintype` or `Subgroup.fintype` in the
presence of `Fintype N`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GroupTheoryAndGeneralizations/GroupSubgroupFinitePublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Finite/Variant70861d4fb3a233a944997dca702a529f91b446687f8701b6dab3a3ed4eb8d535.lean#L257).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9738faee9c74d894afc9f81cdf090629e763d046` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
