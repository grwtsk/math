## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aebc423c-c260-b811-8801-cd76ff462e11`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 259–266.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem simple_induction {p : W → Prop} (w : W) (simple : ∀ i : B, p (s i)) (one : p 1)
    (mul : ∀ w w' : W, p w → p w' → p (w * w')) : p w := by
  have := cs.submonoid_closure_range_simple.symm ▸ Submonoid.mem_top w
  exact Submonoid.closure_induction (fun x ⟨i, hi⟩ ↦ hi ▸ simple i) one (fun _ _ _ _ ↦ mul _ _)
    this

/-- If `p : W → Prop` holds for the identity and it is preserved under multiplying on the left
by a simple reflection, then it holds for all elements of `W`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GroupTheoryAndGeneralizations/CoxeterBasicNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant70b9d06f5c1c763e120750b75e4f17c76fd4d2a5d50201421f70e5fbf196ac24.lean#L259).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `324a8712bed86b424eabc117aeb37e9fea1e1887` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
