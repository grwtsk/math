## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a96ba05a-72ac-e66f-f508-719884db60a9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 190–204.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem closure_induction'' {p : (g : G) → g ∈ closure s → Prop}
    (mem : ∀ x (hx : x ∈ s), p x (subset_closure hx))
    (inv_mem : ∀ x (hx : x ∈ s), p x⁻¹ (inv_mem (subset_closure hx)))
    (one : p 1 (one_mem _))
    (mul : ∀ x y hx hy, p x hx → p y hy → p (x * y) (mul_mem hx hy))
    {x} (h : x ∈ closure s) : p x h :=
  closure_induction_left one (fun x hx y _ hy => mul x y _ _ (mem x hx) hy)
    (fun x hx y _ => mul x⁻¹ y _ _ <| inv_mem x hx) h

/-- An induction principle for elements of `⨆ i, S i`.
If `C` holds for `1` and all elements of `S i` for all `i`, and is preserved under multiplication,
then it holds for all elements of the supremum of `S`. -/
@[to_additive (attr := elab_as_elim) /-- An induction principle for elements of `⨆ i, S i`.
If `C` holds for `0` and all elements of `S i` for all `i`, and is preserved under addition,
then it holds for all elements of the supremum of `S`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GroupTheoryAndGeneralizations/GroupSubgroupPointwiseNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Pointwise/Varianta38a80599e8f5d05586a5366471decd83cd384053cf1d8103329f904132c2c0c.lean#L190).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `059b519bd990107b2b66e16b82b5faa132809f04` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
