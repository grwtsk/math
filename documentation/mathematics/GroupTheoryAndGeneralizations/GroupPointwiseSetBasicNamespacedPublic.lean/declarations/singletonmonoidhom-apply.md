## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6bf1cd56-625f-dc98-6085-14cb338b5e02`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 636–647.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem singletonMonoidHom_apply (a : α) : singletonMonoidHom a = {a} :=
  rfl

end MulOneClass

section Monoid

variable [Monoid α] {s t : Set α} {a : α} {m n : ℕ}

/-- `Set α` is a `Monoid` under pointwise operations if `α` is. -/
@[to_additive (attr := instance_reducible)
  /-- `Set α` is an `AddMonoid` under pointwise operations if `α` is. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GroupTheoryAndGeneralizations/GroupPointwiseSetBasicNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant8982075bcb324e7ad756063c7ea65155e28c0bb0248049de0235f1bc3c05cdd1.lean#L636).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8c3df6de0feb8a12f0005f12d8703c8343341ca2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
