## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:64988b50b88d74165d10c9d6d37b104410f420a336411b931a0306ae533bd1e1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 975–984.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def JepaHeatflowSeed.toResidue (seed : JepaHeatflowSeed) :
    Think.Residue :=
  { target := FWR.Target.RadoProjectedModularHeatflow
    atomId := seed.seedId
    kind := FWR.ResidueKind.conjecturalAtom
    blocks :=
      "Rado-projected modular heatflow seed is a conjecture interface, not theorem authority"
    clearsBy :=
      "finite run receipt, explicit residue ledger, and kernel-checked theorem artifacts for every mathematical bridge" }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GroupTheoryAndGeneralizations/RadoModularHeatflowNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/M506970656c696e652f43656e7465722f5261646f4d6f64756c617248656174666c6f772e6c65616/Variant821e3f12acc5d047df2fb512c5c5d0400f8a90bcb4b8988078cc15c96ec73fe1.lean#L975).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `28a6cca751fa4377a4945d4006349b1063e73970` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
