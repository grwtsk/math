## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4d24bc4f-984b-7bed-b90f-c45d4ad86541`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 286–293.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem kerLift_injective (f : M →* P) : Injective (kerLift f) := fun x y =>
  Quotient.inductionOn₂' x y fun _ _ => (ker f).eq.2

/-- Given congruence relations `c, d` on a monoid such that `d` contains `c`, `d`'s quotient
map induces a homomorphism from the quotient by `c` to the quotient by `d`. -/
@[to_additive /-- Given additive congruence relations `c, d` on an `AddMonoid` such that `d`
contains `c`, `d`'s quotient map induces a homomorphism from the quotient by `c` to the quotient
by `d`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/GroupTheoryAndGeneralizations/CongruenceHomPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Hom/Variantb1189bcfd7c38d529d1b33054886c31816c791dd24b6c17c3263d27b3f1dc0e6.lean#L286).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `91967b7850818f9a0ed89a5aaea8e47b3b9cf821` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
