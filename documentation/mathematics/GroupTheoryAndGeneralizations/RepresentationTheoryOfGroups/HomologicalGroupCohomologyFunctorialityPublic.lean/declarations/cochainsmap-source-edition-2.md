## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:df8f84d15e841397292d8b9d67233f3f313869c683892ab471df49cee645ad89`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 211–217.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable abbrev cochainsMap₂ :
    ModuleCat.of k (H × H → A) ⟶ ModuleCat.of k (G × G → B) :=
  ModuleCat.ofHom <| φ.hom.toLinearMap.compLeft (G × G) ∘ₗ LinearMap.funLeft k A (Prod.map f f)

/-- Given a group homomorphism `f : G →* H` and a representation morphism `φ : Res(f)(A) ⟶ B`,
this is the induced map sending `x : H × H × H → A` to
`(g₁, g₂, g₃ : G × G × G) ↦ φ (x (f g₁, f g₂, f g₃))`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/GroupTheoryAndGeneralizations/RepresentationTheoryOfGroups/HomologicalGroupCohomologyFunctorialityPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Functoriality/Varianta11cd4eb2fd7a0ade8db338d7a715fc6c428c20fb9321a50352a520253fac260.lean#L211).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bcc55ede3007a77d6bd354599141272f03caab9f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
