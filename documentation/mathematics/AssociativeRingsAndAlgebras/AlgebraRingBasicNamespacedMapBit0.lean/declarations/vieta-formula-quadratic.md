## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e425d65f-d0d8-9074-2872-da9c432e20a6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 139–148.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem vieta_formula_quadratic {b c x : α} (h : x * x - b * x + c = 0) :
    ∃ y : α, y * y - b * y + c = 0 ∧ x + y = b ∧ x * y = c := by
  have : c = x * (b - x) := (eq_neg_of_add_eq_zero_right h).trans (by simp [mul_sub, mul_comm])
  refine' ⟨b - x, _, by simp, by rw [this]⟩
  rw [this, sub_add, ← sub_mul, sub_self]

#align Vieta_formula_quadratic vieta_formula_quadratic

end NonUnitalCommRing

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/AssociativeRingsAndAlgebras/AlgebraRingBasicNamespacedMapBit0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantbb8172e23f18c66fc5148d5632334518023ff17fddee5a799f2195e01e82f32c.lean#L139).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `acee93a2d43697d00b8343167d82261b22798d60` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
