## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a7654649-82f4-ed0e-67a3-061948cd6438`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 127–138.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[ext] theorem AddCommMonoidWithOne.ext ⦃inst₁ inst₂ : AddCommMonoidWithOne R⦄
    (h_add : local_hAdd[R, inst₁] = local_hAdd[R, inst₂])
    (h_one : (letI := inst₁; One.one : R) = (letI := inst₂; One.one : R)) :
    inst₁ = inst₂ :=
  AddCommMonoidWithOne.toAddMonoidWithOne_injective <|
    AddMonoidWithOne.ext h_add h_one

namespace NonAssocSemiring

/- The best place to prove that the `NatCast` is determined by the other operations is probably in
an extensionality lemma for `AddMonoidWithOne`, in which case we may as well do the typeclasses
defined in `Mathlib/Algebra/GroupWithZero/Defs.lean` as well. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/AssociativeRingsAndAlgebras/ExtNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ext/Variante24af52f1610af83979afd255fe160c4b05192fa57b2ab2a14fc40bf0d2b3af4.lean#L127).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `89d5f7394d4ed11f040cef3ef8dae2048c8e5c1e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
