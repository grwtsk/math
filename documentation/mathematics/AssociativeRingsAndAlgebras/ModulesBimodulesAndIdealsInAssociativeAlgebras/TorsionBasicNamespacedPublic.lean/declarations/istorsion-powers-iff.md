## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:77eb950b-e767-f5c3-9b57-4894a430d4ae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 882–896.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isTorsion'_powers_iff (p : R) :
    IsTorsion' M (Submonoid.powers p) ↔ ∀ x : M, ∃ n : ℕ, p ^ n • x = 0 := by
  constructor
  · intro h x
    let ⟨⟨a, ⟨n, hn⟩⟩, hx⟩ := @h x
    dsimp at hn
    use n
    rw [hn]
    apply hx
  · intro h x
    let ⟨n, hn⟩ := h x
    exact ⟨⟨_, ⟨n, rfl⟩⟩, hn⟩

/-- In a `p ^ ∞`-torsion module (that is, a module where all elements are cancelled by scalar
multiplication by some power of `p`), the smallest `n` such that `p ^ n • x = 0`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/AssociativeRingsAndAlgebras/ModulesBimodulesAndIdealsInAssociativeAlgebras/TorsionBasicNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant3eb2c331f94ce97ef3447810aea8f73bd4d990a97299a00a65ddb8d0c6e6077d.lean#L882).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9abb579f4a02fb5141c540967af6ee5752e2bacd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
