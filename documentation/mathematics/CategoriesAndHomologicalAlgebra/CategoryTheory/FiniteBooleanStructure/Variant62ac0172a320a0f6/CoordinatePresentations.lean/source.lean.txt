Provisional composite search, probabilistic symbolic recombination and linearized diffusive computation: OpenAI/Codex.
Cache warming and model sculpting: the countless, often unnamed mathematicians, enthusiasts, and curious minds whose work and questions have helped shape these tools, and who now have new ways to pursue mathematical answers to the endlessly deep question: “Why?”
These are owner-supplied provisional roles; exact contributions and source lineage need clarification.

Statements, hypotheses and proof bodies are exact source copies. Original whole-file documentation is retained below and may describe other components.
Only containing namespaces and explicit component imports are changed. Distinct historical representations stay distinct.
Uncompiled; no Lean/Lake invocation, public umbrella admission, geometric provider, or new theorem priority claim.

/- Every complete DAF.System/Presentation/Hom/Fabric/Reaction field and its exact proof is retained. Coordinate observation and Boolean negation are functions on Bool-valued original BitMatrix, not a ZMod-carrier substitution. Original namespaces are retained to preserve exact method/type-extension lookup; physical subject placement is GRWTSK. Distinct historical versions are separate uncompiled files and are not admitted together to an umbrella. -/

# Binary matrices as fabric presentations

This adapter packages the existing declarative matrix and array-backed systems
as assembly presentations.  It reuses `BitMatrix.Adapters.mapRefinement`;
no `BitMatrix.ArrayBacked` refinement proof is duplicated.  Coordinate observations are
presentation morphisms, while executable matrices remain observationally
related to `BitMatrix` through `toMatrix`.
