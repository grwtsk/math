## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ce5e80db2911646091c666d6ae1c9ca02869ce520652903cb822f1dac6a4ae78`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 49–60.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance opensHomHasCoeToFun {U V : Opens X} : CoeFun (U ⟶ V) fun _ => U → V :=
  ⟨fun f x => ⟨x, f.le x.2⟩⟩
#align topological_space.opens.opens_hom_has_coe_to_fun TopologicalSpace.Opens.opensHomHasCoeToFun

/-!
We now construct as morphisms various inclusions of open sets.
-/


-- This is tedious, but necessary because we decided not to allow Prop as morphisms in a category...
/-- The inclusion `U ⊓ V ⟶ U` as a morphism in the category of open sets.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Opens/Variant9b9ba9cb7453b445e7170c0aa996dc83389248bec5be88140344d147ca372217.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Opens/Variant9b9ba9cb7453b445e7170c0aa996dc83389248bec5be88140344d147ca372217.lean#L49).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1dbb28bf02031f4eb52a17285586d7725bab0e81` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
