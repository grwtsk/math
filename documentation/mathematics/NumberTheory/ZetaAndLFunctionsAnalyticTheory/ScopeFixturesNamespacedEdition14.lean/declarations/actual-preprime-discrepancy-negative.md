## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7de28a88-9e8d-24a7-3b4b-b8c24adf1b0d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 29–44.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem actual_preprime_discrepancy_negative :
    criticalCumulativeDiscrepancy (Real.log 2 / 2) < 0 := by
  have hl : 0 < Real.log 2 := Real.log_pos (by norm_num)
  have he := primeLogError_below_first_prime
    (show Real.log 2 / 2 < Real.log 2 by linarith)
  have hz : primeLogPrefix (Real.log 2 / 2) = 0 := by
    unfold primeLogError at he
    linarith
  unfold criticalCumulativeDiscrepancy
  rw [hz, zero_sub]
  have hd := criticalDensity_integral_pos (A := Real.log 2 / 4) (by linarith)
  have hx : 2 * (Real.log 2 / 4) = Real.log 2 / 2 := by ring
  rw [hx] at hd
  exact neg_neg_of_pos hd

/-- The upper touching prime remains in the closed inventory with zero primitive factor. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/NumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctionsAnalyticTheory/ScopeFixturesNamespacedEdition14.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/ScopeFixtures/Variant16e81e179e2fd8a2af789c62b15ecd261434425edf957e5e318a40abdd69a83b.lean#L29).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b523bcb351201763d58697a6ac1ccd3cb4ce9ecb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
