## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d488ebf1ae2ee9588985eaaf68589bd6ec689bb951ad681f0104813fff12811a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 46–52.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def cubicCorrelationJet (A a y : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A a +
    y * deriv (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A) a +
    y ^ 2 / 2 * deriv (deriv (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A)) a +
    y ^ 3 / 6 * deriv (deriv (deriv (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A))) a

/-- The actual remainder subtracts the entire independently specified cubic jet. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/NumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctionsAnalyticTheory/SourceCubicCorrelationTaylorEdition1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/SourceCubicCorrelationTaylor/Variant922b5cdc70520ca789662582186c1f3b61b74fea6a3e3dc7819d46f0a30a7c7a.lean#L46).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f3dc3e02855bdc8f971f169b4bd6af11750326c3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
