## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d0a3f9754a95e0e7114b49c25291d6d128055ca295a9f47328ef4239068834d0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 520–533.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
meta def evalMulHeight : PositivityExt where eval {u α} _ pα? e :=
  match pα? with | none => pure .none | some _ => do
  match u, α, e with
  | 0, ~q(ℝ), ~q(@mulHeight $K $KF $KA $ι $a) =>
    -- Check whether there is a `Finite` instance for `$ι` around.
    match ← trySynthInstanceQ q(Finite $ι) with
    | .some _instFinite =>
      assertInstancesCommute
      return .positive q(mulHeight_pos $a)
    | _ => throwError "index type in Height.mulHeight not known to be finite"
  | _, _, _ => throwError "not Height.mulHeight"

/-- Extension for the `positivity` tactic: `Height.logHeight` is always nonnegative. -/
@[positivity Height.logHeight _]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/NumberTheory/HeightBasicNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantc5076457076582238e04d5f31dcf825e87fc2cf9ba1b20284439f49beef18e51.lean#L520).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `546a7c78395eb14eb2394b2fc07e9231de189cc6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
