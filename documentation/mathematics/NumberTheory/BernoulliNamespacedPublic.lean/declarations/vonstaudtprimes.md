## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:93ea7dc6991c7672cc87b94ce5cc08aea8e98c048bf5f9a206981d9ae484436d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 427–430.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private abbrev vonStaudtPrimes (k : ℕ) : Finset ℕ :=
  (range (2 * k + 2)).filter fun q ↦ q.Prime ∧ (q - 1) ∣ 2 * k

/- Over `ZMod p`, the nonzero `l`-th power sum equals the negative indicator of `(p - 1) ∣ l`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/NumberTheory/BernoulliNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/Bernoulli/Varianta46dff18c3fbde77abec1ada60d02e6658f046c8ad60f75bf4c0b12e11afefa0.lean#L427).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5b1c5085b78d3dadb460017b25f76c1beaf98310` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
