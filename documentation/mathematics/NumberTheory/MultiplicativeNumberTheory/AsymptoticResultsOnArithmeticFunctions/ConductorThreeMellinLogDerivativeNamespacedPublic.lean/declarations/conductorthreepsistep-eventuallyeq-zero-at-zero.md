## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a6e6dca8-34ce-575a-6600-6eabb3cc8269`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 116–124.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem conductorThreePsiStep_eventuallyEq_zero_at_zero :
    conductorThreePsiStep =ᶠ[nhdsWithin (0 : ℝ) (Ioi 0)] 0 := by
  have hIio : Iio (1 : ℝ) ∈ nhdsWithin (0 : ℝ) (Ioi 0) := by
    rw [mem_nhdsWithin_iff_exists_mem_nhds_inter]
    exact ⟨Iio 1, Iio_mem_nhds zero_lt_one, inter_subset_left⟩
  filter_upwards [hIio] with t ht
  rw [conductorThreePsiStep, Nat.floor_eq_zero.mpr (show t < 1 from ht)]
  simp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/NumberTheory/MultiplicativeNumberTheory/AsymptoticResultsOnArithmeticFunctions/ConductorThreeMellinLogDerivativeNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/ConductorThreeMellinLogDerivative/Variant19a7c4c97ba4fecffac1583e260245187b84e390f53067597770202af0ea989d.lean#L116).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b34a1352873cd4f39d405602a1a22c90248f91fa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
