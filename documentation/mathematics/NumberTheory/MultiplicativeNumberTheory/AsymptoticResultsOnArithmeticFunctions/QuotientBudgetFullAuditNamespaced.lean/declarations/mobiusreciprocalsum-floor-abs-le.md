## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:20ea9935-9739-9cc8-ed2a-3e65d8d24267`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 117–122.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mobiusReciprocalSum_floor_abs_le (x : ℝ) (hx : 1 ≤ x) :
    |mobiusReciprocalSum ⌊x⌋₊| ≤ 1 + Real.log x :=
  (mobiusReciprocalSum_abs_le_harmonic _).trans (harmonic_floor_le_one_add_log x hx)

/-- In the closed right half-plane, the exact integrand is bounded by an inverse-square-root
weight. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/NumberTheory/MultiplicativeNumberTheory/AsymptoticResultsOnArithmeticFunctions/QuotientBudgetFullAuditNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/QuotientBudgetFullAudit/Variant046d5a2f0512b32c8a3edc222a0fbe57c3b5effe658fc6e6d644d4e2c9b38890.lean#L117).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `830ec3b1ab8eb985f3a9c35e1f11289d2736509e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
