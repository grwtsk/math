## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:114a29b9-bad5-be2e-b05a-93d6b07c55e0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 804–814.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nonneg_smul {a : ℤ√d} {n : ℕ} (ha : Nonneg a) : Nonneg ((n : ℤ√d) * a) := by
  rw [← Int.cast_ofNat n]
  exact
    match a, nonneg_cases ha, ha with
    | _, ⟨x, y, Or.inl rfl⟩, _ => by rw [smul_val]; trivial
    | _, ⟨x, y, Or.inr <| Or.inl rfl⟩, ha => by
      rw [smul_val]; simpa using nonnegg_pos_neg.2 (sqLe_smul n <| nonnegg_pos_neg.1 ha)
    | _, ⟨x, y, Or.inr <| Or.inr rfl⟩, ha => by
      rw [smul_val]; simpa using nonnegg_neg_pos.2 (sqLe_smul n <| nonnegg_neg_pos.1 ha)
#align zsqrtd.nonneg_smul Zsqrtd.nonneg_smul

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/NumberTheory/ZsqrtdBasicNamespacedSourceEdition2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variant1adf26c84c1025a6de6a9c9f99d95e43ced1f5ce2629b93e55bd0349e25229f9.lean#L804).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c0a5bdb580d82bb290f3cfc0d4850611845c94cc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
