## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:661afdf7dca89aa9fb52b46e828eda4f6903df8911f83f0eea40b1db0eb5ac91`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 828–836.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Ring (euclidean.mixedSpace K) :=
  have : Ring (EuclideanSpace ℝ {w : InfinitePlace K // IsReal w}) := (WithLp.equiv 2 _).ring
  have : Ring (EuclideanSpace ℂ {w : InfinitePlace K // IsComplex w}) := (WithLp.equiv 2 _).ring
  (WithLp.equiv 2 _).ring

variable [NumberField K]

open scoped Classical in
/-- The continuous linear equivalence between the Euclidean mixed space and the mixed space. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheoryGlobalFields/CanonicalEmbeddingBasicNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/Basic/Varianteb8a669b3a1c8ef1b2436101da9ce1ba8d751ce50f4d8b39c7b1f13841a83536.lean#L828).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `82a4cd2cca4d1719930333affd8822ea9a3db609` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
