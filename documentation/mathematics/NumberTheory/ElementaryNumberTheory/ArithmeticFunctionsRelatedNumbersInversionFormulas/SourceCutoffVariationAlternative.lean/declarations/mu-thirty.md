## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6a915b3e-74cb-b67c-24d0-4389339913b0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–93.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem mu_thirty : moebius 30 = -1 := by
  rw [show (30 : ℕ) = 6 * 5 by rfl,
    isMultiplicative_moebius.map_mul_of_coprime (show (6 : ℕ).gcd 5 = 1 by decide),
    mu_six, moebius_apply_prime (by norm_num : Nat.Prime 5)]
  norm_num

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctionsRelatedNumbersInversionFormulas/SourceCutoffVariationAlternative.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/377b428153591b67374fce602bd123768445f8159367835f80eddcba2e665b9fSourceCutoffVari/Variant6c73bc9864f7a3b432c0a313e88233c6982e46f425d904609f0ec2e404a78027.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d733458ee4fd3aabddfe275f5f99dc91b270f7f2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
