## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5fe1a36a-fa7f-b7d7-b57b-ffe37c2b95b9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 49–53.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem term_norm_on_line (c t : ℝ) (n : ℕ) :
    ‖LSeries.term actualMangoldtCoefficients ((c:ℂ)+(t:ℂ)*I) n‖ =
      ‖LSeries.term actualMangoldtCoefficients (c:ℂ) n‖ := by
  simp [LSeries.norm_term_eq]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctionsRelatedNumbersInversionFormulas/SourceActualEulerSupportHeadNative01Namespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualEulerSupportHeadNative01/Variant35d80739b06269fdaa920d8816e6011c06483b90e861d321f69ef5cad7a0e6f6.lean#L49).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f5296ceb68e69efbf54b7c12a81c9ae577fad347` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
