## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a47105cc-1009-9603-7cd4-9c3947b466e2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 266–272.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_primeFactorsList_mul {a b : ℕ} (ha : a ≠ 0) (hb : b ≠ 0) {p : ℕ} :
    p ∈ (a * b).primeFactorsList ↔ p ∈ a.primeFactorsList ∨ p ∈ b.primeFactorsList := by
  rw [mem_primeFactorsList (mul_ne_zero ha hb), mem_primeFactorsList ha, mem_primeFactorsList hb,
    ← and_or_left]
  simpa only [and_congr_right_iff] using Prime.dvd_mul

/-- The sets of factors of coprime `a` and `b` are disjoint -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Factors/Variant5cd19d8c1dc88d05aaf7986af9f5b6eaf1cf8d7b82f52bc87bcebac8accfc879.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Factors/Variant5cd19d8c1dc88d05aaf7986af9f5b6eaf1cf8d7b82f52bc87bcebac8accfc879.lean#L266).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `747602f04098ab86237467f1a3966af27f87249d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
