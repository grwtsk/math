## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c15f452daca9d4a92134361040f5078e5cd7445ed38d36cf58b9a9fafdbde2e9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 677–685.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance nontrivial (n : ℕ) [Fact (1 < n)] : Nontrivial (ZMod n) :=
  ⟨⟨0, 1, fun h =>
      zero_ne_one <|
        calc
          0 = (0 : ZMod n).val := by rw [val_zero]
          _ = (1 : ZMod n).val := congr_arg ZMod.val h
          _ = 1 := val_one n
          ⟩⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variant0ba9d578ac3bc2d6d8fc7c0c29964c3042ff8984b5665c758a58fa5cef67d983.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variant0ba9d578ac3bc2d6d8fc7c0c29964c3042ff8984b5665c758a58fa5cef67d983.lean#L677).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1ca4d51e2e33dba33a0fe7e8619264dd8f0f2652` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
