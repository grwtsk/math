## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5dec68a3-63eb-379a-8d64-e378c4140fdf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 292–298.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_primeFactorsList_mul_left {p a b : ℕ} (hpa : p ∈ a.primeFactorsList) (hb : b ≠ 0) :
    p ∈ (a * b).primeFactorsList := by
  rcases eq_or_ne a 0 with (rfl | ha)
  · simp at hpa
  apply (mem_primeFactorsList_mul ha hb).2 (Or.inl hpa)

/-- If `p` is a prime factor of `b` then `p` is also a prime factor of `a * b` for any `a > 0` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/FactorsNamespacedPrimeFactorsList.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Factors/Variant5cd19d8c1dc88d05aaf7986af9f5b6eaf1cf8d7b82f52bc87bcebac8accfc879.lean#L292).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `747602f04098ab86237467f1a3966af27f87249d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
