## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0f709547-e3c1-9450-d613-87f41d1967c5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 203–210.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem norm_eq_norm_of_isMaxOn_of_ball_subset {f : E → F} {s : Set E} {z w : E}
    (hd : DiffContOnCl ℂ f s) (hz : IsMaxOn (norm ∘ f) s z) (hsub : ball z (dist w z) ⊆ s) :
    ‖f w‖ = ‖f z‖ :=
  norm_eqOn_closedBall_of_isMaxOn (hd.mono hsub) (hz.on_subset hsub) (mem_closedBall.2 le_rfl)

/-- **Maximum modulus principle**: if `f : E → F` is complex differentiable in a neighborhood of `c`
and the norm `‖f z‖` has a local maximum at `c`, then `‖f z‖` is locally constant in a neighborhood
of `c`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/FunctionsOfAComplexVariable/AbsMaxPublicNormMaxAux.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/AbsMax/Variant157fab68842ba112c200713e3167904553d76c7021762400512c3a113e1afc35.lean#L203).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac45bb956abae9cc51d77b9872ea1c047a26c741` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
