## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5bf5b59d-7ce4-47f7-979d-6e5826af84bc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1216–1225.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lim_eq_lim_im_add_lim_re (f : CauSeq ℂ Complex.abs) :
    lim f = ↑(lim (cauSeqRe f)) + ↑(lim (cauSeqIm f)) * I :=
  lim_eq_of_equiv_const <|
    calc
      f ≈ _ := equiv_limAux f
      _ = CauSeq.const Complex.abs (↑(lim (cauSeqRe f)) + ↑(lim (cauSeqIm f)) * I) :=
        CauSeq.ext fun _ =>
          Complex.ext (by simp [limAux, cauSeqRe, ofReal']) (by simp [limAux, cauSeqIm, ofReal'])
#align complex.lim_eq_lim_im_add_lim_re Complex.lim_eq_lim_im_add_lim_re

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/FunctionsOfAComplexVariable/ComplexBasicNamespacedSourceEdition3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant9b62e55bff1629e1b59a8c228cd48f79450c81b02751df6b1af1e959dbbbe730.lean#L1216).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `db28a6adb957e834869f76e0c9fef938a2d00f21` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
