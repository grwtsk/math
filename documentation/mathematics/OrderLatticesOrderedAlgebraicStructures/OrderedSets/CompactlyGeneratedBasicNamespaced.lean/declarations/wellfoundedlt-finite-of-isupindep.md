## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c7baa49-2f91-6c37-ac14-dfcba481f9cf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 348–357.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem WellFoundedLT.finite_of_iSupIndep [WellFoundedLT α] {ι : Type*}
    {t : ι → α} (ht : iSupIndep t) (h_ne_bot : ∀ i, t i ≠ ⊥) : Finite ι :=
  haveI := (WellFoundedLT.finite_of_sSupIndep ht.sSupIndep_range).to_subtype
  Finite.of_injective_finite_range (ht.injective h_ne_bot)

@[deprecated (since := "2024-11-24")]
alias CompleteLattice.WellFoundedLT.finite_of_independent := WellFoundedLT.finite_of_iSupIndep

/-- A complete lattice is said to be compactly generated if any
element is the `sSup` of compact elements. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/OrderLatticesOrderedAlgebraicStructures/OrderedSets/CompactlyGeneratedBasicNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variant76cc53a4ed4c0d8870fb0a2fad449aa3676b3aa6201500c6024a242101c7a5bf.lean#L348).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `de0a98ad215d5d6a6a17372a4bff7156263f66e8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
