## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:479e4e45-22c3-d82f-7c22-0fe8af69e302`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 584–589.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rel_imp_eq_of_rel_imp_le [PartialOrder β] (r : α → α → Prop) [IsSymm α r] {f : α → β}
    (h : ∀ a b, r a b → f a ≤ f b) {a b : α} : r a b → f a = f b := fun hab ↦
  le_antisymm (h a b hab) (h b a <| symm hab)
#align rel_imp_eq_of_rel_imp_le rel_imp_eq_of_rel_imp_le

/-- monotonicity of `≤` with respect to `→` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/OrderLatticesOrderedAlgebraicStructures/OrderedSets/OrderBasicNamespacedLeRfl.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variant8a3ebff385e65d813af068cd03c6db652f907e3c8b8a3eb99cbe71a869d19e59.lean#L584).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ccd9346951a4770b130979a34c392ea9498b4510` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
