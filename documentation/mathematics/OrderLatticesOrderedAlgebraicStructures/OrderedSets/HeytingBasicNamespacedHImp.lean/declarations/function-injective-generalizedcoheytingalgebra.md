## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d28613e71c587e590341a0101f508a8ef06221e703ec678c23c925a2681f8bd5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1263–1280.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def Function.Injective.generalizedCoheytingAlgebra [Sup α] [Inf α] [Bot α]
    [SDiff α] [GeneralizedCoheytingAlgebra β] (f : α → β) (hf : Injective f)
    (map_sup : ∀ a b, f (a ⊔ b) = f a ⊔ f b) (map_inf : ∀ a b, f (a ⊓ b) = f a ⊓ f b)
    (map_bot : f ⊥ = ⊥) (map_sdiff : ∀ a b, f (a \ b) = f a \ f b) :
    GeneralizedCoheytingAlgebra α :=
  { hf.lattice f map_sup map_inf, ‹Bot α›, ‹SDiff α› with
    bot_le := fun a => by
      change f _ ≤ _
      rw [map_bot]
      exact bot_le,
    sdiff_le_iff := fun a b c => by
      change f _ ≤ _ ↔ f _ ≤ _
      erw [map_sdiff, map_sup, sdiff_le_iff] }

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/OrderLatticesOrderedAlgebraicStructures/OrderedSets/HeytingBasicNamespacedHImp.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variantd4522b88520823761c019d4f3990689b6f9d806113330344dff9a439e78afbba.lean#L1263).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `70fc503fddc770441c635d0f93b544e571716b2f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
