## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1a4f85c3ef149c90c5602f3fa5d8f57262b0f246caeb04b82e4a7edfdb49dcdc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1591–1595.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance WithBot.WithTop.completeLinearOrder {α : Type*}
    [ConditionallyCompleteLinearOrder α] : CompleteLinearOrder (WithBot (WithTop α)) :=
  { WithBot.WithTop.completeLattice, WithBot.linearOrder with }
#align with_bot.with_top.complete_linear_order WithBot.WithTop.completeLinearOrder

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/OrderLatticesOrderedAlgebraicStructures/OrderedSets/ConditionallyCompleteLatticeBasicConditionallyCompleteLattice.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variante480aec5f1ae58181af8708689d49c6e280fcd29169dd8f17041c359b5a587c3.lean#L1591).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b048c7d0af95722b06b4d0d6521d2ec56425da55` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
