## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c7c8e25a-c0d4-531d-08a1-4b55bd794ca7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 307–320.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma ωScottContinuous_iff_map_ωSup_of_orderHom {f : α →o β} :
    ωScottContinuous f ↔ ∀ c : Chain α, f (ωSup c) = ωSup (c.map f) := by
  rw [ωScottContinuous_iff_monotone_map_ωSup]
  exact exists_prop_of_true f.monotone'

alias ⟨ωScottContinuous.map_ωSup_of_orderHom, ωScottContinuous.of_map_ωSup_of_orderHom⟩ :=
  ωScottContinuous_iff_map_ωSup_of_orderHom

-- Allow `to_fun` to eta-expand `g ∘ f`. Ideally, `Function.comp_def` would be a global pull lemma
-- instead, which is not supported yet: see https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/40183.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/OrderLatticesOrderedAlgebraicStructures/OrderedSets/OrderOmegaCompletePartialOrderOmegaCompletePartialOrderNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/OmegaCompletePartialOrder/Variantef583910667790656aee711fb47acff9665840f4c20743c068548b9f6a91e7f0.lean#L307).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ee61e1960a2e3adf55dcfe18ee22f5b737154067` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
