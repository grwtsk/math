## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a2d51263-b3b5-48ad-12a8-b0d62f35d09a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–92.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma A_diag_eq_two [IsAddTorsionFree L] (i : ι) : b.A i i = 2 := by
  have : NoZeroSMulDivisors ℤ L := IsAddTorsionFree.to_noZeroSMulDivisors_int
  have aux : (b.A i i - 2) • b.e i = 0 := by
    rw [sub_smul, ofNat_smul_eq_nsmul, ← (b.sl2 i).lie_h_e_nsmul, b.lie_h_e i i]; abel
  rwa [IsAddTorsionFree.zsmul_eq_zero_iff_left (b.sl2 i).e_ne_zero, sub_eq_zero] at aux

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/NonassociativeRingsAndAlgebras/LieAlgebrasAndLieSuperalgebras/LieBasisBasicNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant9038d0c4ba7e74f4d9b9c6cd1f14dc72626adf5b882d41240acb6956b6488b25.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f4c4471b0bce51b1a30d98761d0e26abfeb8b0d6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
