## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f76dc600-3c5b-0c41-91df-9b785db75bf1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem fifthHeight_tendsto_zero {C : ℝ} (hc : PositiveCountBound C) :
    Tendsto (fun A : ℝ => tailError A (fifthHeight A)) atTop (𝓝 0) := by
  apply squeeze_zero' (Eventually.of_forall (fun A => norm_nonneg (tailReadout A (fifthHeight A))))
    (eventually_ge_atTop baseRadius |>.mono (fun A hA => fifthHeight_error_bound hc hA))
  simpa only [mul_zero] using
    (tendsto_rpow_neg_atTop (by norm_num : (0:ℝ)<8)).const_mul (logarithmicConstant C/5)

/-- The actual supremum over all A≥R satisfies the same envelope. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/SequencesSeriesSummability/ConvergenceAndDivergenceOfInfiniteLimitingProcesses/SourceLogarithmicTail.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/SourceLogarithmicTail/Variant21567d53e75708402a42b260e5f2aaccaf2a2f7565c256b76d7fb75c421feed8.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `37b488abc557994755ad6487f27e1e41985cccb1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
