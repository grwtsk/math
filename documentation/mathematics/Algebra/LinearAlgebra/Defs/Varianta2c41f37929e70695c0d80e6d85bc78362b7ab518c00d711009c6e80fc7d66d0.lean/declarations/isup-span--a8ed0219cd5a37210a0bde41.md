## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7bb68180-cd64-3da1-683b-8c1f7dfe28c4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 486–489.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem iSup_span {ι : Sort*} (p : ι → Set M) : ⨆ i, span R (p i) = span R (⋃ i, p i) :=
  le_antisymm (iSup_le fun i => span_mono <| subset_iUnion _ i) <|
    span_le.mpr <| iUnion_subset fun i _ hm => mem_iSup_of_mem i <| subset_span hm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../_verification/specifications/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Defs/Varianta2c41f37929e70695c0d80e6d85bc78362b7ab518c00d711009c6e80fc7d66d0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Defs/Varianta2c41f37929e70695c0d80e6d85bc78362b7ab518c00d711009c6e80fc7d66d0.lean#L486).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `29f56a3fa4b45053eb08e6e8f1dfc19d1294b988` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
