## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:902a84acc6579eeb43e2015575edcdc1ce3f05336d2b03d639c2044ed4a81d5d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 161–166.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def map (comm : φ₁ ≫ b = a ≫ φ₂) : mappingCone φ₁ ⟶ mappingCone φ₂ :=
  desc φ₁ ((Cochain.ofHom a).comp (inl φ₂) (zero_add _)) (b ≫ inr φ₂)
    (by simp [reassoc_of% comm])

variable (comm : φ₁ ≫ b = a ≫ φ₂)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/CategoryTheoryHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebraInCategoryTheoryDerivedCategoriesAndFunctors/PretriangulatedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Pretriangulated/Variant60a09978a003f47e1b882a8a0ee29cd8d59ddf3a8fed8990411cc41e8454f933.lean#L161).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `85878911211140df9f83db3e6c6f88c76e3d1d2d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
