## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cdc0b424443621f9c5c966db6401d6bbf89db219265ffc3238f49a86e74d3a8a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 390–396.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def desc (α : Cochain F K (-1)) (β : G ⟶ K)
    (eq : δ (-1) 0 α = Cochain.ofHom (φ ≫ β)) : mappingCone φ ⟶ K :=
  Cocycle.homOf (descCocycle φ α (Cocycle.ofHom β) (neg_add_cancel 1) (by simp [eq]))

variable (α : Cochain F K (-1)) (β : G ⟶ K) (eq : δ (-1) 0 α = Cochain.ofHom (φ ≫ β))

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/CategoryTheoryHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebraInCategoryTheoryDerivedCategoriesAndFunctors/MappingConeNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/MappingCone/Variant8f3684047ba13d9af4bb50e14634e52b990b9e0edb06da076e0389e87180b040.lean#L390).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a045fef3dbb8a0197fae9896d3f4b41fb83029b3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
