## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a070ec43430ff2c9e4516d8ac4ba20a477aa131ad7fff0b66a6f531fa95f5cd5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 289–303.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def single₀IsoSingle : single₀ V ≅ single V _ 0 :=
  NatIso.ofComponents
    (fun X =>
      { hom := { f := fun i => by cases i <;> exact 𝟙 _ }
        inv := { f := fun i => by cases i <;> exact 𝟙 _ }
        hom_inv_id := to_single₀_ext _ _ (by simp)
        inv_hom_id := by
          ext (_|_)
          · dsimp
            simp
          · dsimp
            rw [Category.comp_id] })
    fun f => by ext (_|_) <;> aesop_cat
#align chain_complex.single₀_iso_single ChainComplex.single₀IsoSingle

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/CategoryTheoryHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebraInCategoryTheoryDerivedCategoriesAndFunctors/SingleSingleObjX.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Single/Variant7a0479e6ace67acaf1b1b3cefb3b6e789851f5106eda799ce85245823b970314.lean#L289).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `69ace6a6831676016eb000e6333437c17f47bc60` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
