## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3a86c5378226b3ebd0e2d0e1d3d0cac70aa2b4ad3d9cf9a150f6167066c674fc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 225–239.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : HasForget₂ (DifferentialObject S C) C where
  forget₂ := forget S C

end HasForget

section ConcreteCategory

variable (S : Type*) [AddMonoidWithOne S]
variable (C : Type (u + 1)) [LargeCategory C] [HasZeroMorphisms C]
variable {FC : C → C → Type*} {CC : C → Type*} [∀ X Y, FunLike (FC X Y) (CC X) (CC Y)]
variable [ConcreteCategory C FC] [HasShift C S]

/--
The type of `C`-morphisms that can be lifted back to morphisms in the category `DifferentialObject`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/CategoryTheoryHomologicalAlgebra/GeneralTheoryOfCategoriesAndFunctors/CategoryTheoryDifferentialObjectNamespacedHomSubtype.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/DifferentialObject/Variant79c736aca78bf36b8079ab9f833de0885c2a5e0503e91c914a90f14fcc5a29b7.lean#L225).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2f9d2fea3c69146b39338b90c9c3327174c78ad5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
