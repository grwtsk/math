## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2d628f24d498e289c4c2f69e648e17c46a76c20e131b06e4d945689fccdecd0a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 668–672.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance prod.mono_lift_of_mono_right {W X Y : C} [HasBinaryProduct X Y] (f : W ⟶ X) (g : W ⟶ Y)
    [Mono g] : Mono (prod.lift f g) :=
  mono_of_mono_fac <| prod.lift_snd _ _
#align category_theory.limits.prod.mono_lift_of_mono_right CategoryTheory.Limits.prod.mono_lift_of_mono_right

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/CategoryTheoryHomologicalAlgebra/GeneralTheoryOfCategoriesAndFunctors/LimitsShapesBinaryProductsNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BinaryProducts/Variant28e86d662bbe4972dd8351a0b8c5685badcf363937216de260bf0cd5d0b134c3.lean#L668).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `83b74b9661833a18affbb9b7d69ae3b7f309f548` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
