## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:72fe8ee64b95dbed2fb9ac8464a5ddb0910aa32edffd97078f3ded4510d66eed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 72–84.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def adj : free ⊣ forget AddCommGrpCat.{u} :=
  Adjunction.mkOfHomEquiv
    { homEquiv X Y := by
        refine ConcreteCategory.homEquiv.trans (Equiv.trans ?_ TypeCat.homEquiv.symm)
        exact FreeAbelianGroup.lift.symm
      -- Porting note (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/11041): used to be just `by intros; ext; rfl`.
      homEquiv_naturality_left_symm := by
        intros
        ext
        dsimp [ConcreteCategory.homEquiv]
        rw [← FreeAbelianGroup.lift_comp]
        rfl }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/CategoryTheoryHomologicalAlgebra/GeneralTheoryOfCategoriesAndFunctors/GrpAdjunctionsPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Adjunctions/Variant1014fa2036a77addeeea0ff501f0cee690996c0289d109b6add406198673ab23.lean#L72).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2e160aeea75dc0383eb332ea279df02765f72c3c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
