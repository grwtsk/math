## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fb557457727d53141f53cca2702048b255909bc1198cd59191094de23c964249`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 449–458.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mapRightId [Q.RespectsIso] [W.RespectsIso] :
    mapRight (P := P) (Q := Q) (W := W) L (𝟙 R) (fun X ↦ by simpa using X.prop) ≅ 𝟭 _ :=
  NatIso.ofComponents (fun X => isoMk (Iso.refl _) (Iso.refl _))

set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency.types false in
variable (L) in
/-- The functor `P.Comma L R₁ Q W ⥤ P.Comma L R₃ Q W` induced by the composition of the natural
transformations `r : R₁ ⟶ R₂` and `r' : R₂ ⟶ R₃` is naturally isomorphic to the composition of the
functors induced by these natural transformations. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/CategoryTheoryHomologicalAlgebra/GeneralTheoryOfCategoriesAndFunctors/MorphismPropertyCommaPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Comma/Variant1e263a4cd73fbe9358bf0bb51c1f6a6ccd989246f9ee7767a176b75913d74790.lean#L449).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b9ed750bc5ba48fd64d0d9b5373353575df2584f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
