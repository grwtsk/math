## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:21a87bb876b41201dd3ad91d20f82ba949ee61ec80b4934300c996f1737691fd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 196–207.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def relativeDifferentials' :
    PresheafOfModulesOfCommRing.{u} R :=
  mk (fun X ↦ CommRingCat.KaehlerDifferential (φ'.app X))
    -- Have to hint `g' := R.map f` below, or it gets unfolded weirdly.
    (fun f ↦ CommRingCat.KaehlerDifferential.map (g' := R.map f) (φ'.naturality f))
    -- Without `dsimp`, `ext` doesn't pick up the right lemmas.
    (fun _ ↦ by dsimp; ext; simp)
    (fun _ _ ↦ by dsimp; ext; simp)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/CategoryTheoryHomologicalAlgebra/GeneralTheoryOfCategoriesAndFunctors/PresheafNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/Presheaf/Variant83de36b20e2be112723b71fc203beb1d043a04ffaed65788f84207bbca6a602c.lean#L196).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a523d59b7c91120450ed1474a7d7a1b96d9e51a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
