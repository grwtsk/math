## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3de30c2a6821263dedf97d0f24965de9b7575bd42db33ab807b4e73373ab145c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev Decomposed (J : Type u₁) [Category.{v₁} J] :=
  Σj : ConnectedComponents J, Component j
#align category_theory.decomposed CategoryTheory.Decomposed

-- This name may cause clashes further down the road, and so might need to be changed.
/--
The inclusion of each component into the decomposed category. This is just `sigma.incl` but having
this abbreviation helps guide typeclass search to get the right category instance on `decomposed J`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/CategoryTheoryHomologicalAlgebra/GeneralTheoryOfCategoriesAndFunctors/ConnectedComponentsComponent.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ConnectedComponents/Variant706d5900cb2887c456751231869688e3e32922f6d871d5d92c015d290107c0fa.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `414ea026c12d4d68480cbb0c6abdd86158bf7348` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
