## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:18c3cfed9c1242b5d8dc75c6be35569fb9ccf5c838f7fbd1c536b6ab73457474`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 248–262.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofCoimageImageComparisonIsIso : Abelian C where

end CategoryTheory.Abelian

namespace CategoryTheory.Abelian

variable {C : Type u} [Category.{v} C] [Abelian C]

-- Porting note: the below porting note is from mathlib3!
-- Porting note: this should be an instance,
-- but triggers https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/2055
-- We set it as a local instance instead.
-- instance (priority := 100)
-- Turning it into a global instance breaks `Mathlib/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/Free.lean`.
/-- An abelian category has finite biproducts. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/CategoryTheoryHomologicalAlgebra/CategoricalAlgebra/AbelianBasic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant8820b6a14711a3c41a8da9a1cf85367595f182c423d875bc0ec23f52c230b926.lean#L248).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a4cf1ee9d88e62618593153621d96ac586c8b8f2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
