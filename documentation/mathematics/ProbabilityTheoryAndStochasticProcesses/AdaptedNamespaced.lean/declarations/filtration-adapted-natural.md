## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:11277c63-ec39-eb9c-f7fe-15c7e2d2648c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Filtration.adapted_natural [MetrizableSpace β] [mβ : MeasurableSpace β] [BorelSpace β]
    {u : ι → Ω → β} (hum : ∀ i, StronglyMeasurable[m] (u i)) :
    Adapted (Filtration.natural u hum) u := by
  intro i
  refine StronglyMeasurable.mono ?_ (le_iSup₂_of_le i (le_refl i) le_rfl)
  rw [stronglyMeasurable_iff_measurable_separable]
  exact ⟨measurable_iff_comap_le.2 le_rfl, (hum i).isSeparable_range⟩

/-- Progressively measurable process. A sequence of functions `u` is said to be progressively
measurable with respect to a filtration `f` if at each point in time `i`, `u` restricted to
`Set.Iic i × Ω` is measurable with respect to the product `MeasurableSpace` structure where the
σ-algebra used for `Ω` is `f i`.
The usual definition uses the interval `[0,i]`, which we replace by `Set.Iic i`. We recover the
usual definition for index types `ℝ≥0` or `ℕ`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/ProbabilityTheoryAndStochasticProcesses/AdaptedNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Adapted/Variant91d7bbd56a618257bcc5ca28946ae46aedbb59bc787771dbdfa545dcdcdf44a2.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5742ca511fdf56398d41b15714e476b1e454d9e8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
