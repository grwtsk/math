## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3dbd4232-80cf-5315-fc5e-6b97734a7faf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pdf_eq_zero_of_measure_eq_zero_or_top {X : Ω → E} {s : Set E}
    (hu : IsUniform X s ℙ μ) (hμs : μ s = 0 ∨ μ s = ∞) : pdf X ℙ μ =ᵐ[μ] 0 := by
  rcases hμs with H|H
  · simp only [IsUniform, ProbabilityTheory.cond, H, ENNReal.inv_zero, restrict_eq_zero.mpr H,
    smul_zero] at hu
    simp [pdf, hu]
  · simp only [IsUniform, ProbabilityTheory.cond, H, ENNReal.inv_top, zero_smul] at hu
    simp [pdf, hu]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/ProbabilityTheoryAndStochasticProcesses/DistributionsUniformUniformNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/Uniform/Variante77c9e6f005090b3cd4ee3cba13dd479f855060ab931d21a06df1cc2cc2033d4.lean#L118).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
