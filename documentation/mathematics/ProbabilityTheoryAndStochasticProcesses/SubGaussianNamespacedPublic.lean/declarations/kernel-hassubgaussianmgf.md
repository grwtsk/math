## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8d5a44735cc4541f2229736b2eb50ec91bbf179fda1b33972b67fb5a2865e31e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 150–158.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Kernel.HasSubgaussianMGF (X : Ω → ℝ) (c : ℝ≥0)
    (κ : Kernel Ω' Ω) (ν : Measure Ω' := by volume_tac) : Prop where
  integrable_exp_mul : ∀ t, Integrable (fun ω ↦ exp (t * X ω)) (κ ∘ₘ ν)
  mgf_le : ∀ᵐ ω' ∂ν, ∀ t, mgf X (κ ω') t ≤ exp (c * t ^ 2 / 2)

namespace Kernel.HasSubgaussianMGF

section BasicProperties

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/ProbabilityTheoryAndStochasticProcesses/SubGaussianNamespacedPublic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/SubGaussian/Variant155d73ea56b5b11c2061fea8b29ff7944b9670e53d495e9f64db679eef32676e.lean#L150).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0392f56ed0dce14393aa269b42c8ddc86d59f0e2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
