## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:af5fadb8-99cd-95a3-3545-d3598d2e5b72`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 250–260.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem signedLaplace_analytic (w : ℝ → ℝ) (hw : Continuous w)
    {C q : ℝ} (hC : 0 ≤ C) (hgrowth : L2Growth w C q) :
    AnalyticOnNhd ℂ (signedLaplace w) RHTerminal.PositiveHalfPlane := by
  have hdiff := (positiveLaplace_analytic w hw hC hgrowth).sub
    (positiveLaplace_analytic (fun u => -w u) hw.neg hC (neg_L2Growth hgrowth))
  apply hdiff.congr (isOpen_lt continuous_const Complex.continuous_re)
  intro z hz
  exact (signedLaplace_eq_difference w hw hC hgrowth hz).symm


end EulerP04RH.LaplaceEnergy
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../_verification/specifications/ProbabilityTheoryAndStochasticProcesses/PolynomialEnergyHolomorphyHistoricalSourceEdition2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/PolynomialEnergyHolomorphy/Variant6636d630ba3c72ccfa714f701db566191aa9c8deb3a21c37911da38f24a9d3cf.lean#L250).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0833d66da06bc96a11e965debccacf6306db5cb8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
