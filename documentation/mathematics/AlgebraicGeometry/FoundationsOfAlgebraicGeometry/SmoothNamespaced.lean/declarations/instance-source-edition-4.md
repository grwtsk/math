## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:929c7df9cc266f0a2610b9056b40205540872acab128d2f250b6b6d19553161b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 177–190.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) [hf : IsSmooth f] : LocallyOfFinitePresentation f := by
  rw [HasRingHomProperty.eq_affineLocally @LocallyOfFinitePresentation]
  rw [HasRingHomProperty.eq_affineLocally @IsSmooth] at hf
  refine affineLocally_le (fun hf ↦ ?_) f hf
  apply RingHom.locally_of_locally (Q := RingHom.FinitePresentation) at hf
  · rwa [RingHom.locally_iff_of_localizationSpanTarget finitePresentation_respectsIso
      finitePresentation_ofLocalizationSpanTarget] at hf
  · introv hf
    algebraize [f]
    -- TODO: why is `algebraize` not generating the following instance?
    haveI : Algebra.IsStandardSmooth R S := hf
    exact this.finitePresentation

end AlgebraicGeometry
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../_verification/specifications/AlgebraicGeometry/FoundationsOfAlgebraicGeometry/SmoothNamespaced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../_support/reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Smooth/Variantf09c2fc661b065ebeecc8031a4680109142c7bbd2da4a4e4f80bc068a557208f.lean#L177).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `489322bd32b20e8189e1d46fa6790a9d22682bca` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
