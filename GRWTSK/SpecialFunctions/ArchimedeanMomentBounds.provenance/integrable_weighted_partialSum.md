## Exact declaration and hypotheses

`GRWTSK.SpecialFunctions.ArchimedeanMomentBounds.integrable_weighted_partialSum`
in `../ArchimedeanMomentBounds.lean`.
Source Git blob: `72d24ec6c700c124fcf09d6632f2f56d1010fb66`.
Source SHA-256: `81af8a1d5155ed72f5e7888b2fb7e3df0fdcdf2c276b74feb1c0c58166034975`.
Statement: Under sigma>0, measurable nonnegative w and an integrable second moment, every t |-> w(t)*S_N(sigma,t/2) is integrable.

## Derivation, exact source, and consumer

Prove 0<=S_N<=C using positivity of each retained rational term and the complete source remainder. Apply integrable domination with measurable finite sums.

Exact formal dependencies: integrable_weighted_centered; CenteredDigamma.centered_tail_enclosure; Integrable.mono'.
Mathematical locator: ArchimedeanMomentBounds.md section 2.
Consumer: integrated_series_remainder and the integrable window indicator in finite_window_remainder.
Full primary argument and hostile checks: `../ArchimedeanMomentBounds.md`.

## Provenance and evidence

Local elementary consequence/adaptation of the canonical centered-digamma
source and pinned Mathlib integration APIs, not a direct formalization of
an entire paper. The classical comparator is NIST DLMF 5.7.6,
https://dlmf.nist.gov/5.7.E6 . Exact upstream authors, paths and blob identities
are individually listed in the companion section 6, at Mathlib
`d13f23b723b8a846827a245b89c10fc7d3f11612`; Lean is `leanprover/lean4:v4.34.1`.

SOURCE_PROOF_CANDIDATE. Elaboration, fresh kernel replay, transitive axiom audit,
independent review and numerical certification: NOT_RUN. Originality UNASSESSED;
no novelty or independent reviewer claimed. Publication is not proof acceptance.
The Fourier-to-test moment supplier and certified core integration remain
separate; no full Weil positivity, RH/GRH, or universal certificate existence follows.
