## Exact declaration and hypotheses

`GRWTSK.SpecialFunctions.ArchimedeanMomentBounds.integrated_series_remainder`
in `../ArchimedeanMomentBounds.lean`.
Source Git blob: `72d24ec6c700c124fcf09d6632f2f56d1010fb66`.
Source SHA-256: `81af8a1d5155ed72f5e7888b2fb7e3df0fdcdf2c276b74feb1c0c58166034975`.
Statement: For every sigma>0, N>=0 and measurable nonnegative w with finite second moment mu2, 0<=integral(w*C)-integral(w*S_N)<=b(sigma+N)*mu2.

## Derivation, exact source, and consumer

Prove both integrals are convergent, express their difference as the integral of the pointwise difference, and integrate frequency_remainder_bounds using nonnegative w.

Exact formal dependencies: integrable_weighted_centered; integrable_weighted_partialSum; frequency_remainder_bounds; Mathlib Bochner integral_sub, integral_nonneg, integral_mono_ae and integral_const_mul.
Mathematical locator: ArchimedeanMomentBounds.md equation (5).
Consumer: An all-frequency rational-series error budget independent of T; the coefficient is tied to the actual digamma source.
Full primary argument and hostile checks: `../ArchimedeanMomentBounds.md`.

## Provenance and evidence

Local elementary consequence/adaptation of the canonical centered-digamma
source and pinned Mathlib integration APIs, not a direct formalization of
an entire paper. The classical comparator is NIST DLMF 5.7.6,

are individually listed in the companion section 6, at Mathlib
`d13f23b723b8a846827a245b89c10fc7d3f11612`; Lean is `leanprover/lean4:v4.34.1`.

SOURCE_PROOF_CANDIDATE. Elaboration, fresh kernel replay, transitive axiom audit,
independent review and numerical certification: NOT_RUN. Originality UNASSESSED;
no novelty or independent reviewer claimed. Publication is not proof acceptance.
The Fourier-to-test moment supplier and certified core integration remain
separate; no full Weil positivity, RH/GRH, or universal certificate existence follows.
