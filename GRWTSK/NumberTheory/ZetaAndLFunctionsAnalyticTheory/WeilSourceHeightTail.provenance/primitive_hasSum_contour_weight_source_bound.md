Statement locator: WSHT-v1-01. MSC2020 primary: 11M41.
Fully qualified declaration: `GRWTSK.NumberTheory.WeilQuadraticForm.SourcePrimeCorrelation.primitive_hasSum_contour_weight_source_bound`.
Source: [WeilSourceHeightTail.lean](../WeilSourceHeightTail.lean).
Classification: local consequence / source-specific return, not a direct paper
formalization or a novelty claim. Originality UNASSESSED.

## Literal statement and hypotheses

```lean
theorem primitive_hasSum_contour_weight_source_bound
    (chi : DirichletCharacter ℂ N) (hprim : chi.IsPrimitive)
    (f : ℝ → ℂ) (A : ℝ) (hA : 0 ≤ A) (hf : Admissible f)
    (hs : tsupport f ⊆ Icc (-A) A) :
    let W := fun s : ℂ => ∫ r : ℝ, correlation f r * Complex.exp ((s - 1 / 2) * (r : ℂ))
    HasSum (fun rho : CriticalStripZero chi => (zeroMultiplicity chi rho : ℂ) * W rho.1)
      ((∫ t : ℝ, weilRightArithmeticIntegrand chi W t) / (2 * (Real.pi : ℂ)) +
        (if N = 1 then W 0 + W 1 else 0))
```

The quantified character/test/support/cutoff assumptions above are retained
literally. No RH, GRH, arithmetic count/growth, simple-zero or numerical-list
premise is added. A primitive character at level one is included. The source endpoint is
not silently identified with the physical `primitiveArithmeticValue`.

## Primary argument and dependency correspondence

Apply the unchanged primitive_hasSum_contour_weight_of_heightCount with D=sourceCountConstant chi and L=3. The source-constant nonnegativity and heightCount_le_source_bound supply all three count premises. This is a source integration result, not a newly discovered counting theorem.

Exact declaration suppliers: DirichletZeroCounting.lean: sourceCountConstant_nonneg; heightCount_le_source_bound. WeilZeroSumReturn.lean: primitive_hasSum_contour_weight_of_heightCount.

The complete analytical argument and exact source digests are in
[README.md](README.md). Local source dependencies are pinned to math@3b02408c60b704321cdf7e2afa452d458778ca1d.
The prior count source has blob `9a9fc7bcf6f16b8953ce4d69cf86cbe1b161614a`;
its constants differ from the separately written uniform 324 estimate.

Upstream Apache-2.0 authorship is preserved; local source is MIT.
This mapping records consequences and API use, not an independent upstream replay.

Consumer: The contour endpoint used in primitive_heightWindow_error_le. Pole-inclusive physical-form assembly is a later consumer.

Hostile check: A merely finite count in each window would not suffice. The supplied theorem quantifies EVERY U>=2. No uniform D=324 assertion or test-dependent choice of D is used.

## Evidence and unresolved obligations

SOURCE_PROOF_CANDIDATE. Elaboration, complete dependency build, fresh kernel
replay, transitive axiom audit, certified computation, independent analytical
review and repository-wide validation: NOT_RUN. Imported candidates and known
historical failures are not promoted. Physical gamma/orientation assembly,
full-domain arithmetic nonnegativity and certified finite enumeration remain
separate obligations. Source publication and literal-text checks are not proof
acceptance. No new frontier registry verification status is claimed.
