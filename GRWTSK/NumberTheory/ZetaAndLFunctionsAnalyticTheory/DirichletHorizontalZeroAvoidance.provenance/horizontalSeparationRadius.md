## Exact statement

The source section supplies `{N : ℕ} [NeZero N]` to source-specific declarations.

```lean
def horizontalSeparationRadius (chi : DirichletCharacter ℂ N) (n : ℕ) : ℝ
```

## Argument and source correspondence

Define the displayed source-dependent reciprocal polynomial. This is a mathematical radius with a consumer, not a new zero set or arithmetic target.

Primary provenance: Local definition using [DirichletZeroCounting.lean](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/1f388b830a790ee8ebbcdc1459f39abce6237591/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctionsAnalyticTheory/DirichletZeroCounting.lean), `sourceCountConstant`. No external adapted theorem or novel formula is claimed.

Retained hypotheses and quantifiers: Positive level, actual character, and a natural height index; the positivity theorem separately establishes that the denominator cannot vanish.

Mathematical consumer and return: Consumed by the positive-radius lemma and the actual zero-avoiding height sequence. It is independent of the test, real coordinate, and choice of sign.

The complete analytical argument, source normalizations, hostile checks,
explicit source-dependent constants, and formal limitations are in [README.md](README.md).
The prior inverse-character arithmetic correction and both zeta pole orientations
are unchanged. No root import, dependency pin, arithmetic definition, or target is replaced.

## Evidence and obligations

SOURCE_PROOF_CANDIDATE. Elaboration/build, fresh kernel replay, transitive axiom
audit, repository-wide verification, independent review: NOT_RUN.
Novelty: UNASSESSED. No new frontier claim ID. Existing dependencies retain their
previous evidence and any known failures. Source-text/hash checks do not establish
parsing, elaboration, theorem acceptance, or a transitive axiom report.

Unexecuted source-bound query after successful elaboration:

```lean
#print axioms GRWTSK.NumberTheory.WeilNegativeWitness.horizontalSeparationRadius
```

No axiom-output claim is made. The current canonical proof-automation skill was
inaccessible; dependent execution was stopped. Ordinary source publication and
its readback receipt are recorded in math#1801, not treated as verification.
