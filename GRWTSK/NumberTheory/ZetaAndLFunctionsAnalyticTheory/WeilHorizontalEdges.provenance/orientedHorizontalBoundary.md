## Exact statement

```lean
def orientedHorizontalBoundary (F : ℂ → ℂ) (f : ℝ → ℂ) (T : ℝ) : ℂ
```

## Proof, source return and consumer

The top edge is reversed and the bottom edge is forward. The denominator is exactly 2*pi*i. The definitions are instantiated only after the actual integrability theorem is supplied.

The signature retains every supplier in the generic lemma. The final primitive
application derives the suppliers from the original completed source and selects
one sequence before all admissible tests. The consumer is horizontal removal in
the pole-inclusive finite-to-infinite Weil contour route, not arithmetic positivity.
No new RH/GRH, simplicity or pole-neutral premise is introduced. The inverse-character
arithmetic convention and both zeta poles remain unchanged.

## Evidence and open obligations

SOURCE_PROOF_CANDIDATE. Elaboration/build, fresh kernel replay, transitive axiom
audit, independent review and repository-wide verification: NOT_RUN. No axiom
report is available. Novelty: UNASSESSED. Text/scalar checks and publication do
not establish Lean acceptance. Finite contour residues, Fourier inversion,
compensated arithmetic evaluation and full arithmetic assembly remain separate.
Fixed-test vanishing does not control unbounded varying-test derivative costs.
