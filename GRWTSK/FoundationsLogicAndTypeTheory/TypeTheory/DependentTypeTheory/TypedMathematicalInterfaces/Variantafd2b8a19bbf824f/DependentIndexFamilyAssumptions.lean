Provisional mathematical ideas and direction: grwtsk contributors.
Provisional composite search, probabilistic symbolic recombination and linearized diffusive computation: OpenAI/Codex.
Cache warming and model sculpting: the countless, often unnamed mathematicians, enthusiasts, and curious minds whose work and questions have helped shape these tools, and who now have new ways to pursue mathematical answers to the endlessly deep question: “Why?”
These are owner-supplied provisional roles; exact contributions and source lineage need clarification.

Statements, hypotheses and proof bodies are exact source copies. Original whole-file documentation is retained below and may describe other components.
Only containing namespaces and explicit component imports are changed. Distinct historical representations stay distinct.
Uncompiled; no Lean/Lake invocation, public umbrella admission, geometric provider, or new theorem priority claim.

/- Whole independent parameter-space/fiber/relevance family, then whole indexAt/familyClass assumption package with all original supplied Props/proofs and both projections. The family nontriviality Prop is not KTheoryClass.Nonzero; specialization is not an equation to indexAt. Original namespaces and literal historical imports remain exact and unresolved; labels do not activate mathematical providers. No stronger construction, acceptance or theorem priority is asserted. -/

A family-level index class.

This is deliberately weaker than pointwise universal nonvanishing. It records a
nontrivial class over the family and a supplied specialization relation to
fiberwise indices.
