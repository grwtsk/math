/-!
The actual adaptive attenuation retains a uniformly positive near-diagonal band.
Together with the retained growing harmonic log bands, this tests the optional
uniform-frame approach. It is not a bound on the actual signed arithmetic rows.
Research direction: grwtsk contributors. Formal construction: OpenAI Codex.
