# Quotients of manifolds

This file contains results about quotients of manifolds by group actions.

## Main results

* `MulAction.instChartedSpaceQuotient`: a choice of charted space structure on the quotient of a
  charted space by a free, properly-discontinuous group action.

## TODO

* if `G` acts smoothly, the quotient is an `IsManifold I n` for a suitable `ModelWithCorners I`.
* if `G` acts smoothly, the projection map is smooth
