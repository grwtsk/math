# Theorem-cell seed emitted from an extracted theorem declaration

A seed records compiled statement, proof, dependency, trust, source, and module
identities.  It is evidence for theorem-cell axes; it is not itself a closed
cell and does not promote an external extraction artifact to theorem authority.
