## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3b4c5947-20e3-233f-8ce6-9cf7a742ff62`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 271–289.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma extendMap_add [Preadditive C] {K L : HomologicalComplex C c} (φ φ' : K ⟶ L)
    (e : c.Embedding c') : extendMap (φ + φ' : K ⟶ L) e = extendMap φ e + extendMap φ' e := by
  ext i'
  by_cases hi' : ∃ i, e.f i = i'
  · obtain ⟨i, hi⟩ := hi'
    simp [extendMap_f _ e hi]
  · apply (K.isZero_extend_X e i' (fun i hi => hi' ⟨i, hi⟩)).eq_of_src

end HomologicalComplex

namespace ComplexShape.Embedding

variable (e : Embedding c c') (C : Type*) [Category C] [HasZeroObject C]

/-- Given an embedding `e : c.Embedding c'` of complex shapes, this is
the functor `HomologicalComplex C c ⥤ HomologicalComplex C c'` which
extend complexes along `e`: the extended complexes are zero
in the degrees that are not in the image of `e.f`. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Extend/Variantdc8d5452de5bf2763cbb3b60862050cea3546626b666632aa283d277ee2a37fd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Extend/Variantdc8d5452de5bf2763cbb3b60862050cea3546626b666632aa283d277ee2a37fd.lean#L271).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f7324babd79b38d233a0ce9562c0f65a95bec0d0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
