## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6f93fff78efc133dbf9fe0929a2c0e79ddb72a46b0872cc1870f488b9e7416dc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 160–167.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def descCompHomotopy {X Y Z : C} (f : X ⟶ Y) (g : Y ⟶ Z) (I : InjectiveResolution X)
    (J : InjectiveResolution Y) (K : InjectiveResolution Z) :
    Homotopy (desc (f ≫ g) K I) (desc f J I ≫ desc g K J) := by
  apply descHomotopy (f ≫ g) <;> simp
#align category_theory.InjectiveResolution.desc_comp_homotopy CategoryTheory.InjectiveResolution.descCompHomotopy

-- We don't care about the actual definitions of these homotopies.
/-- Any two injective resolutions are homotopy equivalent. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/InjectiveResolution/Variant363ad724b9add54bda1898a6a8bdce35b4a501800f391318e0d0fe3a0f447711.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/InjectiveResolution/Variant363ad724b9add54bda1898a6a8bdce35b4a501800f391318e0d0fe3a0f447711.lean#L160).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1cf6bd7ccde0865f7108ecfa0d1d99b8a01a9dca` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
