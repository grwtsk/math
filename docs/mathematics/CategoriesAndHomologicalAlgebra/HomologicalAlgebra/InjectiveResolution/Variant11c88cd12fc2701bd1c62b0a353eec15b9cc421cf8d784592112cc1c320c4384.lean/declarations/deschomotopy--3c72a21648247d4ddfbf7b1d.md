## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4de234a40784c8e325744d74c8fcc24740d5afc1d46aa4f2d3967811f1e145db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–161.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def descHomotopy {Y Z : C} (f : Y ⟶ Z) {I : InjectiveResolution Y} {J : InjectiveResolution Z}
    (g h : I.cocomplex ⟶ J.cocomplex) (g_comm : I.ι ≫ g = (CochainComplex.single₀ C).map f ≫ J.ι)
    (h_comm : I.ι ≫ h = (CochainComplex.single₀ C).map f ≫ J.ι) : Homotopy g h :=
  Homotopy.equivSubZero.invFun (descHomotopyZero _ (by simp [g_comm, h_comm]))
#align category_theory.InjectiveResolution.desc_homotopy CategoryTheory.InjectiveResolution.descHomotopy

/-- The descent of the identity morphism is homotopic to the identity cochain map. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/InjectiveResolution/Variant11c88cd12fc2701bd1c62b0a353eec15b9cc421cf8d784592112cc1c320c4384.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/InjectiveResolution/Variant11c88cd12fc2701bd1c62b0a353eec15b9cc421cf8d784592112cc1c320c4384.lean#L155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b8e27831190922dcd4254730a41ee4fd6dc851d4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
