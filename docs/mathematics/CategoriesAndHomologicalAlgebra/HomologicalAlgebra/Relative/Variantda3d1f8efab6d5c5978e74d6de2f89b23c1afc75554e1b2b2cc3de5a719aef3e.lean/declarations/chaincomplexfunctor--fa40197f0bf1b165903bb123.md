## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:918b682af8810e7e50a3be7875d82032f227ab426067d53c58466cdad013f1c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def chainComplexFunctor : C ⥤ SSetPair.{w} ⥤ ChainComplex C ℕ :=
  cokernel (chainComplexFunctorLeftToRight.{w} C)

/--
For any pair of simplicial sets `i : X ⟶ Y` (with `i` a monomorphism)
and any `R : C`, this is the map from the chain complex of `Y`
(with coefficients in `R`) to the chain complex of the pair,
as a natural transformation of bifunctors `C ⥤ SSetPair ⥤ ChainComplex C ℕ`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Relative/Variantda3d1f8efab6d5c5978e74d6de2f89b23c1afc75554e1b2b2cc3de5a719aef3e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Relative/Variantda3d1f8efab6d5c5978e74d6de2f89b23c1afc75554e1b2b2cc3de5a719aef3e.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93c5c477d3afa4b973820a29ae5c54e7b15f44cb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
