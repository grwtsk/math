## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3ae74c26-b9fa-be34-4564-68705825c154`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–106.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma BoundaryGE.false_of_isTruncLE {j : ι} (hj : e.BoundaryGE j) [e.IsTruncLE] : False := by
  obtain ⟨i, hi⟩ := e.mem_prev hj.1
  exact hj.2 i (by simpa only [hi] using hj.1)

/-- The upper boundary of an embedding `e : Embedding c c'`, as a predicate on `ι`.
It is satisfied by `j : ι` when there exists `k' : ι'` not in the image of `e.f`
such that `c'.Rel (e.f j) k'`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Boundary/Variant1931ff740a967dfe696b286441b620ebdd77b924a2220b1dc8b98a22a7e1623a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Boundary/Variant1931ff740a967dfe696b286441b620ebdd77b924a2220b1dc8b98a22a7e1623a.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `494578335c26f753f67c60f860e82f98dd7b9c93` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
