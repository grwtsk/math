## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:20205a3edcbd03b90a9369a01334bf9302fa8c25f83294287128e85631eb7ae9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 46–55.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def shortComplexFunctor' (i j k : ι) : HomologicalComplex C c ⥤ ShortComplex C where
  obj K := ShortComplex.mk (K.d i j) (K.d j k) (K.d_comp_d i j k)
  map f :=
    { τ₁ := f.f i
      τ₂ := f.f j
      τ₃ := f.f k }

/-- The functor `HomologicalComplex C c ⥤ ShortComplex C` which sends a homological
complex `K` to the short complex `K.X (c.prev i) ⟶ K.X i ⟶ K.X (c.next i)`. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalComplex/Variant2d058d7bc29d53f8e242d9027e04c8a527a0f16dc1eba9f4f2544eb5e5125dd5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalComplex/Variant2d058d7bc29d53f8e242d9027e04c8a527a0f16dc1eba9f4f2544eb5e5125dd5.lean#L46).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1e069893509f834ef89e9b6b927cc3afeff0fc26` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
