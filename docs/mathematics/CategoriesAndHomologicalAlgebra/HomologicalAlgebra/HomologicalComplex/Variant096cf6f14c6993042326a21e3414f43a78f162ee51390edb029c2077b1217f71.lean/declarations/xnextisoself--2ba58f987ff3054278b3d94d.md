## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e754b6d79f6ccdd839ff8a60d3c0fc954cd30d93161f151ab0b8e4172e2c3f37`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 428–438.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def xNextIsoSelf {i : ι} (h : ¬c.Rel i (c.next i)) : C.xNext i ≅ C.X i :=
  eqToIso <|
    congr_arg C.X
      (by
        dsimp [ComplexShape.next]
        rw [dif_neg]; rintro ⟨j, hj⟩
        have : c.next i = j := c.next_eq' hj
        rw [this] at h; contradiction)

/-- The differential mapping into `C.X j`, or zero if there isn't one.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalComplex/Variant096cf6f14c6993042326a21e3414f43a78f162ee51390edb029c2077b1217f71.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalComplex/Variant096cf6f14c6993042326a21e3414f43a78f162ee51390edb029c2077b1217f71.lean#L428).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `be7aafdcb846fec1407c9c3fa2ae7b8530188539` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
