## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cca95ea4-2a98-0d0f-bc7a-004948a89bfc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 214–222.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma truncGE'Map_comp : truncGE'Map (φ ≫ φ') e = truncGE'Map φ e ≫ truncGE'Map φ' e := by
  ext i
  by_cases hi : e.BoundaryGE i
  · simp [truncGE'Map_f_eq_opcyclesMap _ _ hi rfl, opcyclesMap_comp]
  · simp [truncGE'Map_f_eq _ _ hi rfl]

variable [HasZeroObject C]

/-- The morphism `K.truncGE e ⟶ L.truncGE e` induced by a morphism `K ⟶ L`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/TruncGE/Variantc1cee0ca1ccdfb1054faaae26b9427e4c4da2f9da77b518f3b5ef349b7a1d621.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/TruncGE/Variantc1cee0ca1ccdfb1054faaae26b9427e4c4da2f9da77b518f3b5ef349b7a1d621.lean#L214).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `75e493ba5831951e5acbb88c3323bcea99d9fabc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
