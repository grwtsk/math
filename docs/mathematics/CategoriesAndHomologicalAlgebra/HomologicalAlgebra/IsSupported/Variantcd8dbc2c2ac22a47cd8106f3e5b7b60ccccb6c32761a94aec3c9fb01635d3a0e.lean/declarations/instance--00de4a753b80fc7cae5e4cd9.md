## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:db67abec1447ebd3809abaf0ca2b05e58280df7f63b74e62b51ac2151e4933c6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 68–75.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [K.IsStrictlySupported e] :
    K.op.IsStrictlySupported e.op := by
  rw [isStrictlySupported_op_iff]
  infer_instance

/-- If `K : HomologicalComplex C c'`, then `K.IsStrictlySupported e` holds for
an embedding `e : c.Embedding c'` of complex shapes if `K` is exact at `i'`
whenever `i'` is not of the form `e.f i` for some `i`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/IsSupported/Variantcd8dbc2c2ac22a47cd8106f3e5b7b60ccccb6c32761a94aec3c9fb01635d3a0e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/IsSupported/Variantcd8dbc2c2ac22a47cd8106f3e5b7b60ccccb6c32761a94aec3c9fb01635d3a0e.lean#L68).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7554c07f7e1d04039458b5455c116af3ac280207` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
