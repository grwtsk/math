## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f0e95eeacc225e11ec1b162a647f6b46376f0339dfb424ea239e05c4007e1403`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 224–234.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def isLimitKernelFork :
    IsLimit (kernelFork K e hj' hi hi' hk hk' cocone hcocone cone) :=
  KernelFork.isLimitOfIsLimitOfIff' hcone _
    (d_comp_desc_eq_zero_iff K e hj' hi hi' hk hk' cocone hcocone)

end rightHomologyData

open rightHomologyData in
/-- The right homology data of `(K.extend e).sc' i' j' k'` that is deduced
from a right homology data of `K.sc' i j k`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/ExtendHomology/Variantfc6f78e56cf348ed80de1867ae9fec55221429ed31bae71e331f76f59daa3158.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/ExtendHomology/Variantfc6f78e56cf348ed80de1867ae9fec55221429ed31bae71e331f76f59daa3158.lean#L224).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6d28939108e240243c1843b6570c9ed6de78e111` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
