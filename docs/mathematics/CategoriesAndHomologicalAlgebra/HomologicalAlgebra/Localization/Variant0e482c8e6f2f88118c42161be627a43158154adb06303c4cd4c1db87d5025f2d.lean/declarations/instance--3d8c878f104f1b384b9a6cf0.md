## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:16058702de1fef90b3459117cff42f96ef2bd4fcc74b5a93410b9c0495dc341e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 328–334.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : (ComplexShape.up ℤ).QFactorsThroughHomotopy C :=
  (ComplexShape.up ℤ).QFactorsThroughHomotopy_of_exists_prev (fun n => ⟨n - 1, by simp⟩) C

/-- When we define the derived category as `HomologicalComplexUpToQuasiIso C (ComplexShape.up ℤ)`,
i.e. as the localization of cochain complexes with respect to quasi-isomorphisms, this
example shall say that the derived category is also the localization of the homotopy
category with respect to quasi-isomorphisms. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Localization/Variant0e482c8e6f2f88118c42161be627a43158154adb06303c4cd4c1db87d5025f2d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Localization/Variant0e482c8e6f2f88118c42161be627a43158154adb06303c4cd4c1db87d5025f2d.lean#L328).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `abf88c7ffddb2b3c52c9375fcc271516a9d29acd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
