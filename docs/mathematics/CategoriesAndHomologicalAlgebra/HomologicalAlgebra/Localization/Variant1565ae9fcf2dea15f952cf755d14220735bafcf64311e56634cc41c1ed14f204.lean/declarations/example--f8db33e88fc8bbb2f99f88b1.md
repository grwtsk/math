## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:430efa1ae45c5c127baf3f915b3f8ab2a1f7408fcd01c0708c6746e7abfef69e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 289–310.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example [(HomologicalComplex.quasiIso C (ComplexShape.up ℤ)).HasLocalization] :
    HomologicalComplexUpToQuasiIso.Qh.IsLocalization
      (HomotopyCategory.quasiIso C (ComplexShape.up ℤ)) :=
  inferInstance

end CochainComplex

namespace CategoryTheory.Functor

variable {C D : Type*} [Category C] [Category D] (F : C ⥤ D)
  {ι : Type*} (c : ComplexShape ι)

section

variable [Preadditive C] [Preadditive D]
  [CategoryWithHomology C] [CategoryWithHomology D]
  [(HomologicalComplex.quasiIso D c).HasLocalization]
  [F.Additive] [F.PreservesHomology]

/-- The localizer morphism which expresses that `F.mapHomologicalComplex c` preserves
quasi-isomorphisms. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Localization/Variant1565ae9fcf2dea15f952cf755d14220735bafcf64311e56634cc41c1ed14f204.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Localization/Variant1565ae9fcf2dea15f952cf755d14220735bafcf64311e56634cc41c1ed14f204.lean#L289).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `18cc2c00a4d9dce63c39dcde483588621831e653` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
