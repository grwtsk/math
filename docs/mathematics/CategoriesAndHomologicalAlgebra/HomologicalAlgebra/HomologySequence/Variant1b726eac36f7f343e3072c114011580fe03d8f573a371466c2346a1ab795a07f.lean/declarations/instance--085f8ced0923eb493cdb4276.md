## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cb6cd9b69dbdec428f92e610d95fd07f97631d77c5cf8b199a2e7bb0aa3aadb8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 116–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [K.HasHomology i] [K.HasHomology j] :
    Mono ((composableArrows₃ K i j).map' 0 1) := by
  dsimp
  infer_instance

#adaptation_note /-- nightly-2024-03-11
We turn off simprocs here.
Ideally someone will investigate whether `simp` lemmas can be rearranged
so that this works without the `set_option`,
*or* come up with a proposal regarding finer control of disabling simprocs. -/
set_option simprocs false in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomologySequence/Variant1b726eac36f7f343e3072c114011580fe03d8f573a371466c2346a1ab795a07f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomologySequence/Variant1b726eac36f7f343e3072c114011580fe03d8f573a371466c2346a1ab795a07f.lean#L116).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93426cb64c1e46fa454e7b7c030b6de2da429e93` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
