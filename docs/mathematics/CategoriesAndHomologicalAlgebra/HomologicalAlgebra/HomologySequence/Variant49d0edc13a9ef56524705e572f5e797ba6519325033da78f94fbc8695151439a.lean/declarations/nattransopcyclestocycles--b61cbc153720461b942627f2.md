## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c3f419f35a424fef99da9c0bb739efe03c839cf9824b3594266ca7255e6f515e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 93–107.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def natTransOpCyclesToCycles [CategoryWithHomology C] :
    opcyclesFunctor C c i ⟶ cyclesFunctor C c j where
  app K := K.opcyclesToCycles i j

end HasZeroMorphisms

section Preadditive

variable {C ι : Type*} [Category* C] [Preadditive C] {c : ComplexShape ι}
  (K : HomologicalComplex C c) (i j : ι) (hij : c.Rel i j)

namespace HomologySequence

/-- The diagram `K.homology i ⟶ K.opcycles i ⟶ K.cycles j ⟶ K.homology j`. -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomologySequence/Variant49d0edc13a9ef56524705e572f5e797ba6519325033da78f94fbc8695151439a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomologySequence/Variant49d0edc13a9ef56524705e572f5e797ba6519325033da78f94fbc8695151439a.lean#L93).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3c1f7c810ab91d41268aa5c5cf3f498c5215a687` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
