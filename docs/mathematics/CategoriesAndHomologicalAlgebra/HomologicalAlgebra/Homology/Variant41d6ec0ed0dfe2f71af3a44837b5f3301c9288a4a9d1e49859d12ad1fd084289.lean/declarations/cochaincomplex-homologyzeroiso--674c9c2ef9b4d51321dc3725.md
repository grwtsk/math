## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:96761bebb7156be8a89ae554cae0ac2aa257f9ac506ad651e066035e7dd5704f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 159–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

          (Iso.refl _) (by simp) : Arrow.mk (C.dTo 0) ≅ Arrow.mk 0)
      (Arrow.isoMk (Iso.refl _) (C.xNextIso rfl) (by simp) :

/-- The `n + 1`th homology of a chain complex (as kernel of 'the differential from `Cₙ₊₁`' modulo
the image of 'the differential to `Cₙ₊₁`') is isomorphic to the kernel of `d : Cₙ₊₁ → Cₙ` modulo
the image of `d : Cₙ₊₂ → Cₙ₊₁`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Homology/Variant41d6ec0ed0dfe2f71af3a44837b5f3301c9288a4a9d1e49859d12ad1fd084289.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Homology/Variant41d6ec0ed0dfe2f71af3a44837b5f3301c9288a4a9d1e49859d12ad1fd084289.lean#L159).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b22e4e18ade5de3e43e61479d8bf5ab205f79761` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
