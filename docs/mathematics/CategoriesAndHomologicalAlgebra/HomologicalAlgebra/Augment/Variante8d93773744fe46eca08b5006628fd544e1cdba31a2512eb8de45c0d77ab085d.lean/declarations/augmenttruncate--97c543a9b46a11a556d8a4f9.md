## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:99c43b330160379fc73c8126ab3e467f400a8eb4403b87f989ed1a5fbabbe3ec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 139–165.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def augmentTruncate (C : ChainComplex V ℕ) :
    augment (truncate.obj C) (C.d 1 0) (C.d_comp_d _ _ _) ≅ C where
  hom :=
    { f := fun i => by cases i <;> exact 𝟙 _
      comm' := fun i j => by
        -- Porting note: was an rcases n with (_|_|n) but that was causing issues
        match i with
        | 0 | 1 | n+2 => cases' j with j <;> dsimp [augment, truncate] <;> simp }
  inv :=
    { f := fun i => by cases i <;> exact 𝟙 _
      comm' := fun i j => by
        -- Porting note: was an rcases n with (_|_|n) but that was causing issues
        match i with
        | 0 | 1 | n+2 => cases' j with j <;> dsimp [augment, truncate] <;> simp }

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Augment/Variante8d93773744fe46eca08b5006628fd544e1cdba31a2512eb8de45c0d77ab085d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Augment/Variante8d93773744fe46eca08b5006628fd544e1cdba31a2512eb8de45c0d77ab085d.lean#L139).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fe2d9689017c8f461f669e04758e45f7137f4203` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
