## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2e799b53138246014fb0aeceaef39751be29994ce82e1c3bd14916cfcdc8d52d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def truncateAugment (C : ChainComplex V ℕ) {X : V} (f : C.X 0 ⟶ X) (w : C.d 1 0 ≫ f = 0) :
    truncate.obj (augment C f w) ≅ C where
  hom := { f := fun _ => 𝟙 _ }
  inv :=
    { f := fun _ => 𝟙 _
      comm' := fun i j => by
        cases j <;>
          · dsimp
            simp }
  hom_inv_id := by
    ext (_ | i) <;>
      · dsimp
        simp
  inv_hom_id := by
    ext (_ | i) <;>
      · dsimp
        simp

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Augment/Variantd3318b4f96e83eb0b916de3051600e0720badb7dcaa00037abc911808b000ca8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Augment/Variantd3318b4f96e83eb0b916de3051600e0720badb7dcaa00037abc911808b000ca8.lean#L97).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0fb8e7c63414374b16daf601668400a3fd1ec808` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
