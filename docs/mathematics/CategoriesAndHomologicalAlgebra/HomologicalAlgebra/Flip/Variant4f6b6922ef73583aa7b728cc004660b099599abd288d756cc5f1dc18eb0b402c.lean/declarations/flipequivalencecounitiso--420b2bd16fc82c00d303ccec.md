## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:46dad4a1c21b2d61a2c2eb0a48ee1226af59da30db01da3ff0716937fb2becdf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–123.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

def flipEquivalenceCounitIso :
    flip V c' c ⋙ flip V c c' ≅ 𝟭 (HomologicalComplex (HomologicalComplex V c') c) :=
  NatIso.ofComponents
    (fun C =>
      { hom :=
          { f := fun i => { f := fun j => 𝟙 ((C.X i).X j) }
            comm' := fun i j _ => by
              ext

              simp only [Category.id_comp, Category.comp_id] }
        inv :=
          { f := fun i => { f := fun j => 𝟙 ((C.X i).X j) }
            comm' := fun i j _ => by
              ext
              dsimp
              simp only [Category.id_comp, Category.comp_id] } })

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Flip/Variant4f6b6922ef73583aa7b728cc004660b099599abd288d756cc5f1dc18eb0b402c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Flip/Variant4f6b6922ef73583aa7b728cc004660b099599abd288d756cc5f1dc18eb0b402c.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b82aa952fa338fb6bb10019f26d175c2ac751fdc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
