## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dff9422b-c75d-a2b2-d655-58c27f6bbb24`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 268–275.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nullHomotopicMap_comp (hom : ∀ i j, C.X i ⟶ D.X j) (g : D ⟶ E) :
    nullHomotopicMap hom ≫ g = nullHomotopicMap fun i j => hom i j ≫ g.f j := by
  ext n
  dsimp [nullHomotopicMap, fromNext, toPrev, AddMonoidHom.mk'_apply]
  simp only [Preadditive.add_comp, assoc, g.comm]

/-- Compatibility of `nullHomotopicMap'` with the postcomposition by a morphism
of complexes. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Homotopy/Variant7767fdf7022ee1e76e3de12c3dc49f4e546d74f052c23385776fd38eb9c7019f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Homotopy/Variant7767fdf7022ee1e76e3de12c3dc49f4e546d74f052c23385776fd38eb9c7019f.lean#L268).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6428bdc5ba13fddda5f428de0a2c3f462d0a6be0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
