## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fa73057c-8e8a-5d33-10cb-24e1fa1966b8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 373–379.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nullHomotopicMap_f {k₂ k₁ k₀ : ι} (r₂₁ : c.Rel k₂ k₁) (r₁₀ : c.Rel k₁ k₀)
    (hom : ∀ i j, C.X i ⟶ D.X j) :
    (nullHomotopicMap hom).f k₁ = C.d k₁ k₀ ≫ hom k₀ k₁ + hom k₁ k₂ ≫ D.d k₂ k₁ := by
  dsimp only [nullHomotopicMap]
  rw [dNext_eq hom r₁₀, prevD_eq hom r₂₁]

-- Cannot be @[simp] because `k₀` and `k₂` cannot be inferred by `simp`.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Homotopy/Variant7767fdf7022ee1e76e3de12c3dc49f4e546d74f052c23385776fd38eb9c7019f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Homotopy/Variant7767fdf7022ee1e76e3de12c3dc49f4e546d74f052c23385776fd38eb9c7019f.lean#L373).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6428bdc5ba13fddda5f428de0a2c3f462d0a6be0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
