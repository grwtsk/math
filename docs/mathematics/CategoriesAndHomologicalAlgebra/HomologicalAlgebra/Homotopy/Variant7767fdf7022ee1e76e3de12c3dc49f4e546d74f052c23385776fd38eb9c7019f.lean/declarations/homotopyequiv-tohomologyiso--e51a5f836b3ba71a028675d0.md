## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:00aa52dd6900bff88dad962686883dab02bef045f8801741b13f27bef1fb238c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 956–963.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def HomotopyEquiv.toHomologyIso (h : HomotopyEquiv K L) (i : ι)
    [K.HasHomology i] [L.HasHomology i] : K.homology i ≅ L.homology i where
  hom := homologyMap h.hom i
  inv := homologyMap h.inv i
  hom_inv_id := by rw [← homologyMap_comp, h.homotopyHomInvId.homologyMap_eq, homologyMap_id]
  inv_hom_id := by rw [← homologyMap_comp, h.homotopyInvHomId.homologyMap_eq, homologyMap_id]

end
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Homotopy/Variant7767fdf7022ee1e76e3de12c3dc49f4e546d74f052c23385776fd38eb9c7019f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Homotopy/Variant7767fdf7022ee1e76e3de12c3dc49f4e546d74f052c23385776fd38eb9c7019f.lean#L956).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6428bdc5ba13fddda5f428de0a2c3f462d0a6be0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
