## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:01c18dca18f7e79ef93652e18c82fa88fc5d621a5103a41244ced7666b65d446`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 477–490.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkInductiveAux₁ :
    ∀ n,
      Σ' (f : P.X n ⟶ Q.X (n + 1)) (f' : P.X (n + 1) ⟶ Q.X (n + 2)),
        e.f (n + 1) = P.d (n + 1) n ≫ f + f' ≫ Q.d (n + 2) (n + 1)
  | 0 => ⟨zero, one, comm_one⟩
  | 1 => ⟨one, (succ 0 ⟨zero, one, comm_one⟩).1, (succ 0 ⟨zero, one, comm_one⟩).2⟩
  | n + 2 =>
    ⟨(mkInductiveAux₁ (n + 1)).2.1, (succ (n + 1) (mkInductiveAux₁ (n + 1))).1,
      (succ (n + 1) (mkInductiveAux₁ (n + 1))).2⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Homotopy/Variant5929aafd73a11b4157ab7871c82af73d6e45d78746b18cd0952f7e1234c83966.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Homotopy/Variant5929aafd73a11b4157ab7871c82af73d6e45d78746b18cd0952f7e1234c83966.lean#L477).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8fcd279cc14596e19dc6634845551fbd0729615c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
