## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:994ee247-f163-2ee2-5dc5-4228b157c924`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 115–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem prevD_nat (C D : CochainComplex V ℕ) (i : ℕ) (f : ∀ i j, C.X i ⟶ D.X j) :
    prevD i f = f i (i - 1) ≫ D.d (i - 1) i := by
  dsimp [prevD]
  cases i
  · simp only [shape, CochainComplex.prev_nat_zero, ComplexShape.up_Rel, Nat.one_ne_zero,
      not_false_iff, comp_zero, reduceCtorEq]
  · congr <;> simp

/-- A homotopy `h` between chain maps `f` and `g` consists of components `h i j : C.X i ⟶ D.X j`
which are zero unless `c.Rel j i`, satisfying the homotopy condition.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Homotopy/Variant5929aafd73a11b4157ab7871c82af73d6e45d78746b18cd0952f7e1234c83966.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Homotopy/Variant5929aafd73a11b4157ab7871c82af73d6e45d78746b18cd0952f7e1234c83966.lean#L115).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8fcd279cc14596e19dc6634845551fbd0729615c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
