## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dcbf9df80ef0a57d873c5a2a4a636dd4f48172d33030033cb82bef2d76b1496a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 241–253.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def nullHomotopicMap (hom : ∀ i j, C.X i ⟶ D.X j) : C ⟶ D where
  f i := dNext i hom + prevD i hom
  comm' i j hij := by
    have eq1 : prevD i hom ≫ D.d i j = 0 := by
      simp only [prevD, AddMonoidHom.mk'_apply, assoc, d_comp_d, comp_zero]
    have eq2 : C.d i j ≫ dNext j hom = 0 := by
      simp only [dNext, AddMonoidHom.mk'_apply, d_comp_d_assoc, zero_comp]
    rw [dNext_eq hom hij, prevD_eq hom hij, Preadditive.comp_add, Preadditive.add_comp, eq1, eq2,
      add_zero, zero_add, assoc]

/-- Variant of `nullHomotopicMap` where the input consists only of the
relevant maps `C_i ⟶ D_j` such that `c.Rel j i`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Homotopy/Variant4febe7b150e681b0616fcc7f861f213c196ae6a29de9d273a8946ac601912057.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/Homotopy/Variant4febe7b150e681b0616fcc7f861f213c196ae6a29de9d273a8946ac601912057.lean#L241).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `250f50ab6117c9ef3c5cf5daf68c0b6a1f7e0328` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
