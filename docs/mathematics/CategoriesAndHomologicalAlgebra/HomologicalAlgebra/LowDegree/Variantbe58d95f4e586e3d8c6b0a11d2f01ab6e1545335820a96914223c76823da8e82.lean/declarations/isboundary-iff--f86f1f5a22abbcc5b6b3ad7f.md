## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:23ad7077-4ee0-ad62-2180-3212f070ca70`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 578–587.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isBoundary₀_iff (a : A) :
    IsBoundary₀ G a ↔ ∃ x : G →₀ A, x.sum (fun g z => g • z - z) = a := by
  constructor
  · rintro ⟨x, hx⟩
    use x.sum (fun g a => single g (-(g⁻¹ • a)))
    simp_all [sum_neg_index, sum_sum_index, neg_add_eq_sub]
  · rintro ⟨x, hx⟩
    use x.sum (fun g a => single g (-(g • a)))
    simp_all [sum_neg_index, sum_sum_index, neg_add_eq_sub]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/LowDegree/Variantbe58d95f4e586e3d8c6b0a11d2f01ab6e1545335820a96914223c76823da8e82.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/LowDegree/Variantbe58d95f4e586e3d8c6b0a11d2f01ab6e1545335820a96914223c76823da8e82.lean#L578).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8dd456866147588b348a0b16b5ea928e6ab81586` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
