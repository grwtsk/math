## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:284a1b8aa55505b8dba79f461bf087d55c9f9eec6ffbdbb37cad94fe9980b332`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 275–283.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def shortComplexH2 : ShortComplex (ModuleCat k) :=
  mk (d₁₂ A) (d₂₃ A) (d₁₂_comp_d₂₃ A)

end Differentials

section Cocycles

/-- The 1-cocycles `Z¹(G, A)` of `A : Rep k G`, defined as the kernel of the map
`Fun(G, A) → Fun(G × G, A)` sending `(f, (g₁, g₂)) ↦ ρ_A(g₁)(f(g₂)) - f(g₁g₂) + f(g₁).` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/LowDegree/Variant83a64edc8f58670369a28d3cf55c5f02ddd932e4cc9a660952b31004873d3226.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/LowDegree/Variant83a64edc8f58670369a28d3cf55c5f02ddd932e4cc9a660952b31004873d3226.lean#L275).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a6e53aa4eaff2e4f9cf230191b46bdf74f43019` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
