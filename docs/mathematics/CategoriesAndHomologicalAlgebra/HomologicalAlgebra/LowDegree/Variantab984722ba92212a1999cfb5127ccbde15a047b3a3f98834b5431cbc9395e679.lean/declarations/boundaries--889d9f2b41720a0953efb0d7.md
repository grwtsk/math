## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:11b958207c3181ce609e20ea56f06f0a3c4a5d2bea2ce9b5681f9fc8d51af349`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 398–403.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def boundaries₁ : Submodule k (G →₀ A) :=
  LinearMap.range (d₂₁ A).hom

/-- The 2-boundaries `B₂(G, A)` of `A : Rep k G`, defined as the image of the map
`(G³ →₀ A) → (G² →₀ A)` defined by
`a·(g₁, g₂, g₃) ↦ ρ_A(g₁⁻¹)(a)·(g₂, g₃) - a·(g₁g₂, g₃) + a·(g₁, g₂g₃) - a·(g₁, g₂)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/LowDegree/Variantab984722ba92212a1999cfb5127ccbde15a047b3a3f98834b5431cbc9395e679.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/LowDegree/Variantab984722ba92212a1999cfb5127ccbde15a047b3a3f98834b5431cbc9395e679.lean#L398).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6c7ff337eb8bd6257d3aada1ec1b9cccacbed085` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
