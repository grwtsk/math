## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3ab73eac95dd2a6716c519e00e1d942d63b4b3aa951d03bcdb128884ba944521`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 733–736.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def coboundariesOfIsMulCoboundary₂ {f : G × G → M} (hf : IsMulCoboundary₂ f) :
    coboundaries₂ (Rep.ofMulDistribMulAction G M) :=
  ⟨Additive.ofMul ∘ f, hf.choose, funext fun g ↦ hf.choose_spec g.1 g.2⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/LowDegree/Variant32c37df86754e60d015037a2c7a14df9cd443df67c1831734c7e0d8824e880b8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/LowDegree/Variant32c37df86754e60d015037a2c7a14df9cd443df67c1831734c7e0d8824e880b8.lean#L733).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `023ea16e8534ddc5d6d3bafccea77930a8b78afe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
