## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8b2b4f11-86ba-5fc0-1585-3908d943236c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 320–327.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma inl_v_descCochain_v (p₁ p₂ p₃ : ℤ) (h₁₂ : p₁ + (-1) = p₂) (h₂₃ : p₂ + n = p₃) :
    (inl φ).v p₁ p₂ h₁₂ ≫ (descCochain φ α β h).v p₂ p₃ h₂₃ =
        α.v p₁ p₃ (by rw [← h₂₃, ← h₁₂, ← h, add_comm m, add_assoc, neg_add_cancel_left]) := by
  simpa only [Cochain.comp_v _ _ (show -1 + n = m by omega) p₁ p₂ p₃
    (by omega) (by omega)] using
      Cochain.congr_v (inl_descCochain φ α β h) p₁ p₃ (by omega)

@[reassoc (attr := simp)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/MappingCone/Variantb00dab5e66186d03cd2cacdafabb8365ac90bed40b3f7d95cce5761d6e2859b2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/MappingCone/Variantb00dab5e66186d03cd2cacdafabb8365ac90bed40b3f7d95cce5761d6e2859b2.lean#L320).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `43ec787b1163378f40577e42768b40d6516ee645` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
