## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:13d24aa40a77daf249aee096884656dd79fcdfdf8e8b4d234ebd1b7cd2ab02a7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 684–694.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def equivHom : (F ⟶ G) ≃+ Cocycle F G 0 where
  toFun := ofHom
  invFun := homOf
  left_inv := homOf_ofHom_eq_self
  right_inv := ofHom_homOf_eq_self
  map_add' := by cat_disch

variable (K)

/-- The `1`-cocycle given by the differential on a cochain complex. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomComplex/Variant458d2765721e325248b9de80a7adbec5dc02e56938edadbc9812e22d387c3144.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomComplex/Variant458d2765721e325248b9de80a7adbec5dc02e56938edadbc9812e22d387c3144.lean#L684).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `449c1a6db4b04e7ab81a49e244cf8a586cfc29f6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
