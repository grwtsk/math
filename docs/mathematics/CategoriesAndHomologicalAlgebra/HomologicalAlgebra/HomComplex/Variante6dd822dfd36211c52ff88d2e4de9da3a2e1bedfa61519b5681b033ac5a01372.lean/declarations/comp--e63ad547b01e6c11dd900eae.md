## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2e802c9ecadc5ad9f74666a105fb84c41aacde7b1829669798bdc4037156466e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 221–237.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def comp {n₁ n₂ n₁₂ : ℤ} (z₁ : Cochain F G n₁) (z₂ : Cochain G K n₂) (h : n₁ + n₂ = n₁₂) :
    Cochain F K n₁₂ :=
  Cochain.mk (fun p q hpq => z₁.v p (p + n₁) rfl ≫ z₂.v (p + n₁) q (by omega))

/-! If `z₁` is a cochain of degree `n₁` and `z₂` is a cochain of degree `n₂`, and that
we have a relation `h : n₁ + n₂ = n₁₂`, then `z₁.comp z₂ h` is a cochain of degree `n₁₂`.
The following lemma `comp_v` computes the value of this composition `z₁.comp z₂ h`
on a triplet `⟨p₁, p₃, _⟩` (with `p₁ + n₁₂ = p₃`). In order to use this lemma,
we need to provide an intermediate integer `p₂` such that `p₁ + n₁ = p₂`.
It is advisable to use a `p₂` that has good definitional properties
(i.e. `p₁ + n₁` is not always the best choice.)

When `z₁` or `z₂` is a `0`-cochain, there is a better choice of `p₂`, and this leads
to the two simplification lemmas `comp_zero_cochain_v` and `zero_cochain_comp_v`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomComplex/Variante6dd822dfd36211c52ff88d2e4de9da3a2e1bedfa61519b5681b033ac5a01372.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomComplex/Variante6dd822dfd36211c52ff88d2e4de9da3a2e1bedfa61519b5681b033ac5a01372.lean#L221).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1777784ebf73f8a194d44a540f4fbf94a3f076d3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
