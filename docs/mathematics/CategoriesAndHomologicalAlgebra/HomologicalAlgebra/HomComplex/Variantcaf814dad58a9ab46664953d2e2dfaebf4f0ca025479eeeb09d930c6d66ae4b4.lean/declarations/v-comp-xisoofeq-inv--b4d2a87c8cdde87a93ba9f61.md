## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e5758b8b-49cc-e261-ce46-d2b7cdfd92e4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 220–226.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma v_comp_XIsoOfEq_inv
    (γ : Cochain F G n) (p q q' : ℤ) (hpq : p + n = q) (hq' : q' = q) :
    γ.v p q hpq ≫ (HomologicalComplex.XIsoOfEq G hq').inv = γ.v p q' (by rw [hq', hpq]) := by
  subst hq'
  simp only [HomologicalComplex.XIsoOfEq, eqToIso_refl, Iso.refl_inv, comp_id]

/-- The composition of cochains. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomComplex/Variantcaf814dad58a9ab46664953d2e2dfaebf4f0ca025479eeeb09d930c6d66ae4b4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomComplex/Variantcaf814dad58a9ab46664953d2e2dfaebf4f0ca025479eeeb09d930c6d66ae4b4.lean#L220).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d7e9361b612653516a97c345f76344d476ee5410` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
