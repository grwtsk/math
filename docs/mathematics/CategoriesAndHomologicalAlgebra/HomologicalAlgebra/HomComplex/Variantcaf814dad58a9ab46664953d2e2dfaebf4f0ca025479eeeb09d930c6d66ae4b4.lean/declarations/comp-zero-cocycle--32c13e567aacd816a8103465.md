## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:03e9de3b-869e-6926-1af8-77cc4ac5a16e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 746–753.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma δ_comp_zero_cocycle {n : ℤ} (z₁ : Cochain F G n) (z₂ : Cocycle G K 0) (m : ℤ) :
    δ n m (z₁.comp z₂.1 (add_zero n)) =
      (δ n m z₁).comp z₂.1 (add_zero m) := by
  by_cases hnm : n + 1 = m
  · simp [δ_comp_zero_cochain _ _ _ hnm]
  · simp [δ_shape _ _ hnm]

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomComplex/Variantcaf814dad58a9ab46664953d2e2dfaebf4f0ca025479eeeb09d930c6d66ae4b4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomComplex/Variantcaf814dad58a9ab46664953d2e2dfaebf4f0ca025479eeeb09d930c6d66ae4b4.lean#L746).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d7e9361b612653516a97c345f76344d476ee5410` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
