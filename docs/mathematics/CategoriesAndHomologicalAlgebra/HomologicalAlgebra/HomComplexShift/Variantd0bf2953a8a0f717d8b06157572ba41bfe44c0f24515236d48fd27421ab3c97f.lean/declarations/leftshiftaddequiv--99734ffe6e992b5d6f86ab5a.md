## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7016fd7bd9834e97328196e7f9046c7f062b9882768fc961d1d51221c9e6b466`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 567–576.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def leftShiftAddEquiv (n a n' : ℤ) (hn' : n + a = n') :
    Cocycle K L n ≃+ Cocycle (K⟦a⟧) L n' where
  toFun γ := γ.leftShift a n' hn'
  invFun γ := γ.leftUnshift n hn'
  left_inv γ := by cat_disch
  right_inv γ := by cat_disch
  map_add' γ γ' := by cat_disch

/-- The additive equivalence `(K⟦n⟧) ⟶ L ≃+ Cocycle K L m` when `m + n = 0`. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomComplexShift/Variantd0bf2953a8a0f717d8b06157572ba41bfe44c0f24515236d48fd27421ab3c97f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/HomologicalAlgebra/HomComplexShift/Variantd0bf2953a8a0f717d8b06157572ba41bfe44c0f24515236d48fd27421ab3c97f.lean#L567).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b8e212634b5f53e0741408ea2c3ee9cdd7d94893` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
