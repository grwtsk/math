## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2176a9e1-d1c6-9d40-62a4-65101d838a46`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 101–109.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma IsHomological.of_iso {F₁ F₂ : C ⥤ A} [F₁.IsHomological] (e : F₁ ≅ F₂) :
    F₂.IsHomological :=
  have := preservesZeroMorphisms_of_iso e
  ⟨fun T hT => ShortComplex.exact_of_iso (ShortComplex.mapNatIso _ e)
    (F₁.map_distinguished_exact T hT)⟩

/-- The kernel of a homological functor `F : C ⥤ A` is the strictly full
triangulated subcategory consisting of objects `X` such that
for all `n : ℤ`, `F.obj (X⟦n⟧)` is zero. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HomologicalFunctor/Variantd227861db3975780113281ca1dd7f506c03ee64809a6f62aebc076835d7cdcdd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HomologicalFunctor/Variantd227861db3975780113281ca1dd7f506c03ee64809a6f62aebc076835d7cdcdd.lean#L101).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3dbc67a8b1a4bc4ef9928fe78e75720c5b32df5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
