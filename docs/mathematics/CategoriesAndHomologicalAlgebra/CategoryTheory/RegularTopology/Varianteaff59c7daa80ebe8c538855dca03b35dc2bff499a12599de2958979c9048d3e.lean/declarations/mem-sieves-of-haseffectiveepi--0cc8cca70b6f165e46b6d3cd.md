## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:44b63fa1-65ad-0ad8-e2a9-b696c5ee5787`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 38–51.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem mem_sieves_of_hasEffectiveEpi (S : Sieve X) :
    (∃ (Y : C) (π : Y ⟶ X), EffectiveEpi π ∧ S.arrows π) → (S ∈ (regularTopology C) X) := by
  rintro ⟨Y, π, h⟩
  have h_le : Sieve.generate (Presieve.ofArrows (fun () ↦ Y) (fun _ ↦ π)) ≤ S := by
    rw [Sieve.generate_le_iff (Presieve.ofArrows _ _) S]
    apply Presieve.le_of_factorsThru_sieve (Presieve.ofArrows _ _) S _
    intro W g f

  apply Coverage.saturate_of_superset (regularCoverage C) h_le
  exact Coverage.Saturate.of X _ ⟨Y, π, rfl, h.1⟩

/-- Effective epis in a preregular category are stable under composition. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/RegularTopology/Varianteaff59c7daa80ebe8c538855dca03b35dc2bff499a12599de2958979c9048d3e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/RegularTopology/Varianteaff59c7daa80ebe8c538855dca03b35dc2bff499a12599de2958979c9048d3e.lean#L38).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8f0db8af25882293a4fb4474a4f680db47afddac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
