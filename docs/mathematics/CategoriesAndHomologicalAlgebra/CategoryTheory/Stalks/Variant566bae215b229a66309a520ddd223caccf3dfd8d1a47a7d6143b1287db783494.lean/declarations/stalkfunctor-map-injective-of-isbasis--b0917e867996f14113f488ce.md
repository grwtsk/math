## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c4b9be43-5b1f-9f8e-37fb-9d10d5507b3a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 508–525.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma stalkFunctor_map_injective_of_isBasis
    {F G : X.Presheaf C} {α : F ⟶ G} (hα : ∀ U ∈ B, Function.Injective (α.app (op U))) (x : X) :
    Function.Injective ((stalkFunctor _ x).map α) := by
  intro s t hst
  obtain ⟨U₁, hxU₁, hU₁, s, rfl⟩ := exists_mem_germ_eq_of_isBasis hB _ x s
  obtain ⟨U₂, hxU₂, hU₂, t, rfl⟩ := exists_mem_germ_eq_of_isBasis hB _ x t
  rw [stalkFunctor_map_germ_apply, stalkFunctor_map_germ_apply] at hst
  obtain ⟨W, hxW, hW, iWU₁, iWU₂, heq⟩ := germ_eq_of_isBasis hB _ _ hxU₁ hxU₂ hst
  simp only [← α.naturality_apply, (hα W hW).eq_iff] at heq
  simpa [germ_res_apply'] using congr(F.germ W x hxW $heq)

end IsBasis

variable [HasLimits C] [PreservesLimits (forget C)] [(forget C).ReflectsIsomorphisms]

/-- Let `F` be a sheaf valued in a concrete category, whose forgetful functor reflects isomorphisms,
preserves limits and filtered colimits. Then two sections who agree on every stalk must be equal.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Stalks/Variant566bae215b229a66309a520ddd223caccf3dfd8d1a47a7d6143b1287db783494.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Stalks/Variant566bae215b229a66309a520ddd223caccf3dfd8d1a47a7d6143b1287db783494.lean#L508).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0ec33ddcff63ecf8702fa7553958511a1dd4d021` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
