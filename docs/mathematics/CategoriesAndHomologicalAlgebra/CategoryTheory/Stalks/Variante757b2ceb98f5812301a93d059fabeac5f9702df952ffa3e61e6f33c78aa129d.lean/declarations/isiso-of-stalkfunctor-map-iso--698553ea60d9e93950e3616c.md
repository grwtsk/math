## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d7d2614d-1a75-d790-8e81-c29c8e9b6126`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 625–641.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem isIso_of_stalkFunctor_map_iso {F G : Sheaf C X} (f : F ⟶ G)
    [∀ x : X, IsIso ((stalkFunctor C x).map f.1)] : IsIso f := by
  -- Since the inclusion functor from sheaves to presheaves is fully faithful, it suffices to
  -- show that `f`, as a morphism between _presheaves_, is an isomorphism.
  suffices IsIso ((Sheaf.forget C X).map f) by exact isIso_of_fully_faithful (Sheaf.forget C X) f
  -- We show that all components of `f` are isomorphisms.

/-- Let `F` and `G` be sheaves valued in a concrete category, whose forgetful functor reflects
isomorphisms, preserves limits and filtered colimits. Then a morphism `f : F ⟶ G` is an
isomorphism if and only if all of its stalk maps are isomorphisms.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Stalks/Variante757b2ceb98f5812301a93d059fabeac5f9702df952ffa3e61e6f33c78aa129d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Stalks/Variante757b2ceb98f5812301a93d059fabeac5f9702df952ffa3e61e6f33c78aa129d.lean#L625).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d620ea12831b2d3f8861cfe9574d7736220242f4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
