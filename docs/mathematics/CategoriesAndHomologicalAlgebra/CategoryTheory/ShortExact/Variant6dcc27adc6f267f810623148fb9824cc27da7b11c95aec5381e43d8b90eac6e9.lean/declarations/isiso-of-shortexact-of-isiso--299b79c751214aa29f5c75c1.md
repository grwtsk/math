## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dd6d521f-11e6-3189-376b-e0b41aead302`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 150–159.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isIso₂_of_shortExact_of_isIso₁₃ [Balanced C] {S₁ S₂ : ShortComplex C} (φ : S₁ ⟶ S₂)
    (h₁ : S₁.ShortExact) (h₂ : S₂.ShortExact) [IsIso φ.τ₁] [IsIso φ.τ₃] : IsIso φ.τ₂ := by
  have := h₁.mono_f
  have := h₂.mono_f
  have := h₁.epi_g
  have := h₂.epi_g
  have := mono_τ₂_of_exact_of_mono φ h₁.exact
  have := epi_τ₂_of_exact_of_epi φ h₂.exact
  apply isIso_of_mono_of_epi

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ShortExact/Variant6dcc27adc6f267f810623148fb9824cc27da7b11c95aec5381e43d8b90eac6e9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ShortExact/Variant6dcc27adc6f267f810623148fb9824cc27da7b11c95aec5381e43d8b90eac6e9.lean#L150).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `841bdf36f5a332d995438389ca15b3a86656ff9d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
