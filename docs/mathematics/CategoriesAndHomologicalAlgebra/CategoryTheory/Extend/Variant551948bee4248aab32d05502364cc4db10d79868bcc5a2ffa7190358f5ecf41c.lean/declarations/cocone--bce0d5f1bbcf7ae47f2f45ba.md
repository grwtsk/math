## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6af4f897bb32891bf5c9a2d5546e61f0058749958f007b3114843dc00afafaaa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 161–171.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def cocone (S : Profinite) :
    Cocone (CostructuredArrow.proj toProfinite.op ⟨S⟩ ⋙ toProfinite.op ⋙ G) where
  pt := G.obj ⟨S⟩
  ι := {
    app := fun i ↦ G.map i.hom
    naturality := fun _ _ f ↦ (by
      have := f.w
      simp only [op_obj, const_obj_obj, op_map, CostructuredArrow.right_eq_id, const_obj_map,
        Category.comp_id] at this
      simp [← map_comp, this]) }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Extend/Variant551948bee4248aab32d05502364cc4db10d79868bcc5a2ffa7190358f5ecf41c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Extend/Variant551948bee4248aab32d05502364cc4db10d79868bcc5a2ffa7190358f5ecf41c.lean#L161).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0e0bbd31cebb1f65946416b59eabff9910e5dd11` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
