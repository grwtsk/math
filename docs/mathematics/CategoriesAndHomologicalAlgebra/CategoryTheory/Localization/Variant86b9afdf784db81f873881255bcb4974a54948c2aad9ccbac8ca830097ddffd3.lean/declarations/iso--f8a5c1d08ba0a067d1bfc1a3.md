## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:67a946b6c8d431dbd9feef6b4e3b2a9e7463d0621d15facec552e23b89d7cd09`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 143–154.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def iso (a : A) :
    shiftFunctor D a ⋙ F' ≅ F' ⋙ shiftFunctor E a :=
  Localization.liftNatIso L W (L ⋙ shiftFunctor D a ⋙ F')
    (L ⋙ F' ⋙ shiftFunctor E a) _ _
      ((Functor.associator _ _ _).symm ≪≫
        isoWhiskerRight (L.commShiftIso a).symm F' ≪≫
        Functor.associator _ _ _ ≪≫
        isoWhiskerLeft _ (Lifting.iso L W F F') ≪≫
        F.commShiftIso a ≪≫
        isoWhiskerRight (Lifting.iso L W F F').symm _ ≪≫ Functor.associator _ _ _)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Localization/Variant86b9afdf784db81f873881255bcb4974a54948c2aad9ccbac8ca830097ddffd3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Localization/Variant86b9afdf784db81f873881255bcb4974a54948c2aad9ccbac8ca830097ddffd3.lean#L143).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b4a25de78fb9586f5ed0aed0c3b9685c04abd197` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
