## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d94f633c-9a85-b8fa-8af2-14dcd3bbdd20`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 403–424.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isNormalEpiCategory : IsNormalEpiCategory D where
  normalEpiOfEpi f hf := by
    rw [epi_iff L P] at hf
    obtain ⟨X', Y', f', _, ⟨e⟩⟩ := hf
    let hf' := normalEpiOfEpi f'
    have := preservesCokernel L P hf'.g
    refine ⟨NormalEpi.ofArrowIso ?_ e⟩
    exact {
      W := L.obj hf'.W
      g := L.map hf'.g
      w := by rw [← L.map_comp]; simp [hf'.w]
      isColimit :=
        (CokernelCofork.isColimitMapCoconeEquiv _ L).1
          (isColimitOfPreserves L hf'.isColimit) }

/-- If `L : C ⥤ D` is a localization functor with respect to a Serre class `P` in
the abelian category `C`, then `D` is an abelian category.
Note that we assume that `D` has already been equipped with a preadditive structure,
and that `L` is additive. Otherwise, see the results in the file
`Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Localization/CalculusOfFractions/Preadditive.lean`
which applies because `P.isoModSerre` has a calculus of left and right fractions. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Localization/Variant53519313b8670894f3a7ac9f801aa8624e9a69390cbdaf057b59aab96cef61c5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Localization/Variant53519313b8670894f3a7ac9f801aa8624e9a69390cbdaf057b59aab96cef61c5.lean#L403).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4130052f3d18974b68f21b9e01884c8691187023` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
