## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:63ae08237460ba08ba919cf78a1038ccb6f67e180cc0c6a3bc382f9702a61307`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 251–275.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def inclusionOfMooreComplexMap (X : SimplicialObject A) :
    (normalizedMooreComplex A).obj X ⟶ (alternatingFaceMapComplex A).obj X := by
  dsimp only [normalizedMooreComplex, NormalizedMooreComplex.obj,
    alternatingFaceMapComplex, AlternatingFaceMapComplex.obj]
  apply ChainComplex.ofHom _ _ _ _ _ _ (fun n => (NormalizedMooreComplex.objX X n).arrow)
  /- we have to show the compatibility of the differentials on the alternating
           face map complex with those defined on the normalized Moore complex:
           we first get rid of the terms of the alternating sum that are obviously
           zero on the normalized_Moore_complex -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/AlternatingFaceMapComplex/Variant376e45d736707d516cdc9cf6dea1aa41f97efac65d529117cfe2416287bc7fdd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/AlternatingFaceMapComplex/Variant376e45d736707d516cdc9cf6dea1aa41f97efac65d529117cfe2416287bc7fdd.lean#L251).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8928078f8f13b7fd7608094d474f306eb793b81d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
