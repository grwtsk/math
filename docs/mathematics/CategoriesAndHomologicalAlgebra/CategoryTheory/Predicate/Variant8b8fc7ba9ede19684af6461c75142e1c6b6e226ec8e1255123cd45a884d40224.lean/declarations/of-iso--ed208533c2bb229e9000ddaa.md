## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8671205a-03e6-ae5c-0dff-7a389b10aeb5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 396–406.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem of_iso {L₁ L₂ : C ⥤ D} (e : L₁ ≅ L₂) [L₁.IsLocalization W] : L₂.IsLocalization W := by
  have h := Localization.inverts L₁ W
  rw [MorphismProperty.IsInvertedBy.iff_of_iso W e] at h
  let F₁ := Localization.Construction.lift L₁ (Localization.inverts L₁ W)
  let F₂ := Localization.Construction.lift L₂ h
  exact
    { inverts := h
      isEquivalence := Functor.isEquivalence_of_iso (liftNatIso W.Q W L₁ L₂ F₁ F₂ e) }

/-- If `L : C ⥤ D` is a localization for `W : MorphismProperty C`, then it is also
the case of a functor obtained by post-composing `L` with an equivalence of categories. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Predicate/Variant8b8fc7ba9ede19684af6461c75142e1c6b6e226ec8e1255123cd45a884d40224.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Predicate/Variant8b8fc7ba9ede19684af6461c75142e1c6b6e226ec8e1255123cd45a884d40224.lean#L396).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7c375399b5b6158fadd5c062a65a9eabed27d2a4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
