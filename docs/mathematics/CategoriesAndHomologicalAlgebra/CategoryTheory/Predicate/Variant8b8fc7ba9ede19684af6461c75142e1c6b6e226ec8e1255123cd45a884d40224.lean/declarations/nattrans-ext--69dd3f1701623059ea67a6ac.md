## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a1f17bd3-2af6-2b37-79a8-cbe6be6bc73a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 277–287.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem natTrans_ext (L : C ⥤ D) (W) [L.IsLocalization W] {F₁ F₂ : D ⥤ E} {τ τ' : F₁ ⟶ F₂}
    (h : ∀ X : C, τ.app (L.obj X) = τ'.app (L.obj X)) : τ = τ' := by
  haveI := essSurj L W
  ext Y
  rw [← cancel_epi (F₁.map (L.objObjPreimageIso Y).hom), τ.naturality, τ'.naturality, h]

-- Porting note: the field `iso` was renamed `Lifting.iso'` and it was redefined as
-- `Lifting.iso` with explicit parameters
/-- When `L : C ⥤ D` is a localization functor for `W : MorphismProperty C` and
`F : C ⥤ E` is a functor, we shall say that `F' : D ⥤ E` lifts `F` if the obvious diagram
is commutative up to an isomorphism. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Predicate/Variant8b8fc7ba9ede19684af6461c75142e1c6b6e226ec8e1255123cd45a884d40224.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Predicate/Variant8b8fc7ba9ede19684af6461c75142e1c6b6e226ec8e1255123cd45a884d40224.lean#L277).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7c375399b5b6158fadd5c062a65a9eabed27d2a4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
