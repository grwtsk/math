## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f94c7c06-3e5c-8e81-7a89-441f9bddab28`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 59–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (i : Y ⟶ (functorToAction F).obj X) [Mono i] [IsConnected Y] : ∃ (Z : C) (f : Z ⟶ X)

    IsConnected Z ∧ Mono f ∧ i = u.hom ≫ (functorToAction F).map f := by

  obtain ⟨Z, f, z, hz, hc, hm⟩ := fiber_in_connected_component F X (i.hom y)
  have : IsConnected ((functorToAction F).obj Z) := PreservesIsConnected.preserves
  obtain ⟨u, hu⟩ := connected_component_unique
    (forget₂ (Action FintypeCat (Aut F)) FintypeCat) (B := (functorToAction F).obj Z)

/--
Let `X` be an object of a Galois category with fiber functor `F` and `Y` a sub-`Aut F`-set
of `F.obj X`. Then there exists a sub-object `Z` of `X` and an isomorphism
`Y ≅ F.obj X` as `Aut F`-sets such that the obvious triangle commutes.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Full/Variant0f21c0bb6e62a723f17e0bce8890b2942fe4e9eff20d06ca3d8e88b80375a4df.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Full/Variant0f21c0bb6e62a723f17e0bce8890b2942fe4e9eff20d06ca3d8e88b80375a4df.lean#L59).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7848a9cdb7a371f728f4e90f5890640abc687ca2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
