## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:50e38b600902ef180d732a1cf43f3ec1f28c1bd69083b00d9bf6cf8d05574a6b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 26–41.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure PartOrd where
  /-- Construct a bundled `PartOrd` from the underlying type and typeclass. -/
  of ::
  /-- The underlying partially ordered type. -/
  (carrier : Type*)
  [str : PartialOrder carrier]

attribute [instance] PartOrd.str

initialize_simps_projections PartOrd (carrier → coe, -str)

namespace PartOrd

open Lean.PrettyPrinter.Delaborator in
/-- This prints `PartOrd.of X` as `↧X`. -/
@[app_delab PartOrd.of]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/PartOrd/Variant10d9dc435d751b8e9ce36ab3076c6105c227fdc860d9d277212c8af468f79075.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/PartOrd/Variant10d9dc435d751b8e9ce36ab3076c6105c227fdc860d9d277212c8af468f79075.lean#L26).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cfd8c20088d27b8e9bbdaf30a7df279a43b1a839` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
