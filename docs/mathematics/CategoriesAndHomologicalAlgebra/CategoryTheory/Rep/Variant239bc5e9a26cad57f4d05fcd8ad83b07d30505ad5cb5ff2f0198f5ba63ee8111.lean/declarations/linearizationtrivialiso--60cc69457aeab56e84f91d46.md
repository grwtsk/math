## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ec521689a4f8481671ec227a30b101432526a9d447482ab104fc8d22358c8a23`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 271–277.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def linearizationTrivialIso (X : Type u) :
    (linearization k G).obj (Action.mk X 1) ≅ trivial k G (X →₀ k) :=
  Action.mkIso (Iso.refl _) fun _ => ModuleCat.hom_ext <| Finsupp.lhom_ext' fun _ => LinearMap.ext
    fun _ => linearization_single ..

/-- Given a `G`-action on `H`, this is `k[H]` bundled with the natural representation
`G →* End(k[H])` as a term of type `Rep k G`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Rep/Variant239bc5e9a26cad57f4d05fcd8ad83b07d30505ad5cb5ff2f0198f5ba63ee8111.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Rep/Variant239bc5e9a26cad57f4d05fcd8ad83b07d30505ad5cb5ff2f0198f5ba63ee8111.lean#L271).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cf6d99921ecfae964bd2e8586132f2431d1fe616` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
