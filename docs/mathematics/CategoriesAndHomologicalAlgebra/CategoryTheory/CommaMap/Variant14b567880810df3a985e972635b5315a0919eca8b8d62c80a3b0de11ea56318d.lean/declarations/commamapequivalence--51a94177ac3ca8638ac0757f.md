## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e63725571aebc4b0661942c07245298083aa62d68193502ea63925671f142f7d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def commaMapEquivalence [IsIso β] (X : Comma L' R') :
    StructuredArrow X (Comma.map α β) ≌ Comma (map₂ (𝟙 _) α) (map₂ X.hom (inv β)) where
  functor := commaMapEquivalenceFunctor α β X
  inverse := commaMapEquivalenceInverse α β X
  unitIso := commaMapEquivalenceUnitIso α β X
  counitIso := commaMapEquivalenceCounitIso α β X

end

end StructuredArrow

end CategoryTheory
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CommaMap/Variant14b567880810df3a985e972635b5315a0919eca8b8d62c80a3b0de11ea56318d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CommaMap/Variant14b567880810df3a985e972635b5315a0919eca8b8d62c80a3b0de11ea56318d.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aecdf961e3479159c62063ee9e422e0f603ed6f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
