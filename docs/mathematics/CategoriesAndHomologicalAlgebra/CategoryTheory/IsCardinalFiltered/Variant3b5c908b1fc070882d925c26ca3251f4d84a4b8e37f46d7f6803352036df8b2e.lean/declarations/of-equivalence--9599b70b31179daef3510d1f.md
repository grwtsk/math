## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3ff5602e-18b6-cc36-ec5f-c3aeedbb1fce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 81–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma of_equivalence {J' : Type u'} [Category.{v'} J'] (e : J ≌ J') :
    IsCardinalFiltered J' κ where
  nonempty_cocone F hA := ⟨e.inverse.mapCoconeInv (cocone (F ⋙ e.inverse) hA)⟩

section max

variable {K : Type u'} (S : K → J) (hS : HasCardinalLT K κ)

/-- If `S : K → J` is a family of objects of cardinality `< κ` in a `κ`-filtered category,
this is a  choice of objects in `J` which is the target of a map from any of
the objects `S k`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsCardinalFiltered/Variant3b5c908b1fc070882d925c26ca3251f4d84a4b8e37f46d7f6803352036df8b2e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsCardinalFiltered/Variant3b5c908b1fc070882d925c26ca3251f4d84a4b8e37f46d7f6803352036df8b2e.lean#L81).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c07023a2fd2c1a61dfc17a699082c4f2f4eb017` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
