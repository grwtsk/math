## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:85cf4243d0d24d37582a807336c0789bb0cbde1adb6f15368d689aa353a59574`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 260–272.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def descMorphism (s : Cocone F) : colimit F ⟶ s.pt := ofHom
  { toFun := descFun F s
    map_one' := rfl
    map_zero' := rfl
    map_add' := fun x y ↦ by
      refine Quot.induction_on₂ x y fun a b => ?_
      dsimp [descFun]
      rw [← quot_add]
      rfl
    map_mul' := fun x y ↦ by exact Quot.induction_on₂ x y fun a b => rfl }

/-- Evidence that the proposed colimit is the colimit. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Colimits/Variant6d48e73ec844cbe1d8c3a23f03d679fffc09b5ff88f20df1e0faa0862d27fed0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Colimits/Variant6d48e73ec844cbe1d8c3a23f03d679fffc09b5ff88f20df1e0faa0862d27fed0.lean#L260).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `31092bcece65090d2a8e1b39694c69ba382d1402` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
