## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f0b337c9330dfb6c6043f4dd4f2add01f31ad4802d3c320cda527191a3f0b3a3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 210–221.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def descMorphism (s : Cocone F) : colimit F ⟶ s.pt :=
  ofHom
  { toFun := descFun F s
    map_one' := rfl
    map_mul' x y := by
      induction x using Quot.inductionOn
      induction y using Quot.inductionOn
      dsimp [descFun]
      rw [← quot_mul]
      simp only [descFunLift] }

/-- Evidence that the proposed colimit is the colimit. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Colimits/Variant8a280487cf14a7716c68ee478ea696381d3ab8c7d5120f90812685b287a36385.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Colimits/Variant8a280487cf14a7716c68ee478ea696381d3ab8c7d5120f90812685b287a36385.lean#L210).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `342735cd3fbeba2923f78daf5f061eb37361e474` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
