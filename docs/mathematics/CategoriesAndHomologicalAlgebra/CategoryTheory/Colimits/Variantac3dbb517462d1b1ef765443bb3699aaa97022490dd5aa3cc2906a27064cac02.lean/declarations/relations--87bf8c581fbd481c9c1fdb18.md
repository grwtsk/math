## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:09702a97d68786ad6bc7ad3e5d07dff0bd7321a9f11a50e120c1536438bdabcf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 49–57.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev Relations [DecidableEq J] : AddSubgroup (DFinsupp (fun j ↦ F.obj j)) :=
  AddSubgroup.closure {x | ∃ (j j' : J) (u : j ⟶ j') (a : F.obj j),
    x = DFinsupp.single j' (F.map u a) - DFinsupp.single j a}

/--
The candidate for the colimit of `F`, defined as the quotient of the direct sum
of the commutative groups `F.obj j` by the relations given by the morphisms in
the diagram.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Colimits/Variantac3dbb517462d1b1ef765443bb3699aaa97022490dd5aa3cc2906a27064cac02.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Colimits/Variantac3dbb517462d1b1ef765443bb3699aaa97022490dd5aa3cc2906a27064cac02.lean#L49).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5fd9ec92be411800742200d67562dc53230598cb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
