## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a2a993b8-0105-6ee1-5cfc-5a3463398fb0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 251–274.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

section PullbackMap

variable (f g)

/-- The functoriality of `pullbackObj f g` in both arguments: Given a map from the pullback cospans
of `f' : Y' ⟶ X'` and `g' : Z' ⟶ X'` to the pullback cospan of `f : Y ⟶ X` and `g : Z ⟶ X`
as in the diagram below
```
Y' ⟶ Y
  ↘   ↘
  X' ⟶ X
  ↗   ↗
Z' ⟶ Z
```
if the morphisms `g'` and `g` both have chosen pullbacks, then we get an induced morphism
`pullbackMap f g f' g' comm₁ comm₂` from the chosen pullback of
`f' : Y' ⟶ X'` along `g'` to the chosen pullback of `f : Y ⟶ X` along `g`.
Here `comm₁` and `comm₂` are the commutativity conditions of the squares in the diagram above.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ChosenPullbacksAlong/Variant5fb952c1b2cc2bc4dd91bfdbfbb35c2bea7bcc50cf0d591102f72aca50927065.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ChosenPullbacksAlong/Variant5fb952c1b2cc2bc4dd91bfdbfbb35c2bea7bcc50cf0d591102f72aca50927065.lean#L251).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3f01b0ba88c1460b6cb4fc8daa65803dbe5628e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
