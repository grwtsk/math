## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dc69736c4609769472464a062db03a62a1f2b2f40fd5c465c7c6a6ee7c9fcf1b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 36–51.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure DifferentialObject where
  /-- The underlying object of a differential object. -/
  obj : C
  /-- The differential of a differential object. -/
  d : obj ⟶ obj⟦(1 : S)⟧
  /-- The differential `d` satisfies that `d² = 0`. -/
  d_squared : d ≫ d⟦(1 : S)⟧' = 0 := by aesop_cat

attribute [reassoc (attr := simp)] DifferentialObject.d_squared

variable {S C}

namespace DifferentialObject

/-- A morphism of differential objects is a morphism commuting with the differentials. -/
@[ext]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/DifferentialObject/Variant64ea2d489af36fa2f1f2f7eaf1faacc823f88c5f9d5f2d4df1b162a44adfdd28.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/DifferentialObject/Variant64ea2d489af36fa2f1f2f7eaf1faacc823f88c5f9d5f2d4df1b162a44adfdd28.lean#L36).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a211d4f74bcd4faaa69d1e24605bc2adb730d252` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
