## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d32ceb74a414c92456eff42df41012c31e8711eced9c6e85cec7ceb3d95fefa9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 938–954.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def ofSigmaCofork
    (a : Cofork (I.fstSigmaMapOfIsColimit d hc) (I.sndSigmaMapOfIsColimit d hc)) :
    Multicofork I where
  pt := a.pt
  ι :=
    { app := fun x =>
        match x with
        | WalkingMultispan.left _ => c.inj _ ≫ I.fstSigmaMapOfIsColimit d hc ≫ a.π
        | WalkingMultispan.right _ => d.inj _ ≫ a.π
      naturality := by
        rintro (_ | _) (_ | _) (_ | _ | _)

        · simp [a.condition]
        · simp }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Multiequalizer/Variant3cb2759e82f77788e0865a85fa09fd9f85a936430b746cdbeef95543ffcc5394.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Multiequalizer/Variant3cb2759e82f77788e0865a85fa09fd9f85a936430b746cdbeef95543ffcc5394.lean#L938).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d45c557b49c2b30ad1d455900acf9eacfa974d6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
