## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8508d9c142569f5c4548fde7a09f944919c62e9c204a8c844e8e187bfac021bb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 72–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example [Reflective i] {B : D} : IsIso ((reflectorAdjunction i).unit.app (i.obj B)) :=
  inferInstance

variable {i}

/-- If `A` is essentially in the image of a reflective functor `i`, then `η_A` is an isomorphism.
This gives that the "witness" for `A` being in the essential image can instead be given as the
reflection of `A`, with the isomorphism as `η_A`.

(For any `B` in the reflective subcategory, we automatically have that `ε_B` is an iso.)
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Reflective/Variant606a1fd4a8c902f4e8abe909d93fce9c1540e33fee371281844f205d0a2ddf5b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Reflective/Variant606a1fd4a8c902f4e8abe909d93fce9c1540e33fee371281844f205d0a2ddf5b.lean#L72).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0438f47effee11c3b2f4a52eb194af2abef0f4f4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
