## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ef02a434-f470-6c83-94f4-1869320a370c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 113–128.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem unitCompPartialBijectiveAux_symm_apply [Reflective i] {A : C} {B : D}
    (f : i.obj ((reflector i).obj A) ⟶ i.obj B) :
    (unitCompPartialBijectiveAux _ _).symm f = (reflectorAdjunction i).unit.app A ≫ f := by
  simp [unitCompPartialBijectiveAux, Adjunction.homEquiv_unit]

/-- If `i` has a reflector `L`, then the function `(i.obj (L.obj A) ⟶ B) → (A ⟶ B)` given by
precomposing with `η.app A` is a bijection provided `B` is in the essential image of `i`.
That is, the function `fun (f : i.obj (L.obj A) ⟶ B) ↦ η.app A ≫ f` is bijective,
as long as `B` is in the essential image of `i`.
This definition gives an equivalence: the key property that the inverse can be described
nicely is shown in `unitCompPartialBijective_symm_apply`.

This establishes there is a natural bijection `(A ⟶ B) ≃ (i.obj (L.obj A) ⟶ B)`. In other words,
from the point of view of objects in `D`, `A` and `i.obj (L.obj A)` look the same: specifically
that `η.app A` is an isomorphism.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Reflective/Variant606a1fd4a8c902f4e8abe909d93fce9c1540e33fee371281844f205d0a2ddf5b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Reflective/Variant606a1fd4a8c902f4e8abe909d93fce9c1540e33fee371281844f205d0a2ddf5b.lean#L113).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0438f47effee11c3b2f4a52eb194af2abef0f4f4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
