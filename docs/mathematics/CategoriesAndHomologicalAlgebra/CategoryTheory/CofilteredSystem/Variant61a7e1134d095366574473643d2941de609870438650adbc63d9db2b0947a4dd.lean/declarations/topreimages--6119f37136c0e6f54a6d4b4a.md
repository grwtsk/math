## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:14392c5fdbcd7b2d807a962396e0c8e018ef0a88b443b023df574a659d0d09b2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 173–187.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toPreimages : J ⥤ Type v where
  obj j := ⋂ f : j ⟶ i, F.map f ⁻¹' s
  map g := MapsTo.restrict (F.map g) _ _ fun x h => by
    rw [mem_iInter] at h ⊢
    intro f
    rw [← mem_preimage, preimage_preimage, mem_preimage]
    convert h (g ≫ f); rw [F.map_comp]; rfl
  map_id j := by
    simp +unfoldPartialApp only [MapsTo.restrict, Subtype.map, F.map_id]
    ext
    rfl
  map_comp f g := by
    simp +unfoldPartialApp only [MapsTo.restrict, Subtype.map, F.map_comp]
    rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CofilteredSystem/Variant61a7e1134d095366574473643d2941de609870438650adbc63d9db2b0947a4dd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CofilteredSystem/Variant61a7e1134d095366574473643d2941de609870438650adbc63d9db2b0947a4dd.lean#L173).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ad9baf55666fe1a3a9ef49e443dc90075f87f215` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
