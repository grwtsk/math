## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:32895f5c-387c-7b02-aeb5-cba36d8ddab1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 320–330.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eval_section_surjective_of_surjective (i : J) :
    (fun s : F.sections => s.val i).Surjective := fun x => by
  let s : Set (F.obj i) := {x}
  have := F.toPreimages_nonempty_of_surjective s Fsur (singleton_nonempty x)
  obtain ⟨sec, h⟩ := nonempty_sections_of_finite_cofiltered_system (F.toPreimages s)
  refine ⟨⟨fun j => (sec j).val, fun jk => by simpa [Subtype.ext_iff] using! h jk⟩, ?_⟩
  · have := (sec i).prop
    simp only [mem_iInter, mem_preimage] at this
    have := this (𝟙 i)
    rwa [map_id, id_apply] at this

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CofilteredSystem/Variantb9fc8d07a847c6641d10f950e818785d5a2cf00af2c96c23bb26831e0bf7408b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CofilteredSystem/Variantb9fc8d07a847c6641d10f950e818785d5a2cf00af2c96c23bb26831e0bf7408b.lean#L320).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `08c5d6ceed1884c90345672370ca04b311ffe423` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
