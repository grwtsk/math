## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d0f39291-93ed-5ccf-11cc-a02763f915d0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 352–358.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma congr_φK {γ₁ γ₂ : LeftHomologyMapData φ h₁ h₂} (eq : γ₁ = γ₂) : γ₁.φK = γ₂.φK := by rw [eq]

set_option backward.defeqAttrib.useBackward true in
set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false in
/-- When `S₁.f`, `S₁.g`, `S₂.f` and `S₂.g` are all zero, the action on left homology of a
morphism `φ : S₁ ⟶ S₂` is given by the action `φ.τ₂` on the middle objects. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LeftHomology/Variant07f841967d674baf73153a4fe7378e9f2dfe274e1c9298de1a7eadf3e6cb6270.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LeftHomology/Variant07f841967d674baf73153a4fe7378e9f2dfe274e1c9298de1a7eadf3e6cb6270.lean#L352).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3b85472eef291fd83e327c73f53b3986ace107ab` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
