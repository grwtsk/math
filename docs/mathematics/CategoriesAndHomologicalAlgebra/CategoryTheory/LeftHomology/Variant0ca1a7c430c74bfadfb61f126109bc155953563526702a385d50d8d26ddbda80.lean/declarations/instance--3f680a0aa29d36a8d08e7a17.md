## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a586d4515daa9f5703adb4e08f3e2dc1288b2f8ef4ebf51faf016a5e3e5c22ea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 963–978.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (φ : S₁ ⟶ S₂) (h₁ : S₁.LeftHomologyData) (h₂ : S₂.LeftHomologyData)
    [Epi φ.τ₁] [IsIso φ.τ₂] [Mono φ.τ₃] :
    IsIso (leftHomologyMap' φ h₁ h₂) := by
  let h₂' := LeftHomologyData.ofEpiOfIsIsoOfMono φ h₁
  have : IsIso (leftHomologyMap' φ h₁ h₂') := by
    rw [(LeftHomologyMapData.ofEpiOfIsIsoOfMono φ h₁).leftHomologyMap'_eq]

/-- If a morphism of short complexes `φ : S₁ ⟶ S₂` is such that `φ.τ₁` is epi, `φ.τ₂` is an iso,
and `φ.τ₃` is mono, then the induced morphism on left homology is an isomorphism. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LeftHomology/Variant0ca1a7c430c74bfadfb61f126109bc155953563526702a385d50d8d26ddbda80.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LeftHomology/Variant0ca1a7c430c74bfadfb61f126109bc155953563526702a385d50d8d26ddbda80.lean#L963).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `09103be0097f0884291ab0600425a78927802c0e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
