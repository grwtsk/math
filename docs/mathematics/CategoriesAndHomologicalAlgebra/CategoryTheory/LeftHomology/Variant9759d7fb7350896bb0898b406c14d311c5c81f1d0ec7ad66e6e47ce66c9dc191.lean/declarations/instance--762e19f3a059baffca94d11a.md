## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:703e53872774107dc25ac7b412ffa5613ddad73ecea39403262b9c72fff0084a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 302–309.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Subsingleton (LeftHomologyMapData φ h₁ h₂) :=
  ⟨fun ψ₁ ψ₂ => by
    have hK : ψ₁.φK = ψ₂.φK := by rw [← cancel_mono h₂.i, commi, commi]
    have hH : ψ₁.φH = ψ₂.φH := by rw [← cancel_epi h₁.π, commπ, commπ, hK]
    cases ψ₁
    cases ψ₂
    congr⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LeftHomology/Variant9759d7fb7350896bb0898b406c14d311c5c81f1d0ec7ad66e6e47ce66c9dc191.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LeftHomology/Variant9759d7fb7350896bb0898b406c14d311c5c81f1d0ec7ad66e6e47ce66c9dc191.lean#L302).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `69189da39baaaa8165d5b3f3b6330f2b7251f6cc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
