## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6b92044b-5103-b81d-b71b-cf7c8169d027`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 185–191.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma ofIsLimitKernelFork_f' (hf : S.f = 0) (c : KernelFork S.g) (hc : IsLimit c) :
    (ofIsLimitKernelFork S hf c hc).f' = 0 := by
  rw [← cancel_mono (ofIsLimitKernelFork S hf c hc).i, f'_i, hf, zero_comp]

/-- When the first map `S.f` is zero, this is the left homology data on `S` given
by the chosen `kernel S.g` -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LeftHomology/Variant8d0b8faec1a66a5ba6051833ce0ddec051af0b066b98d419f176db0664755bbf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LeftHomology/Variant8d0b8faec1a66a5ba6051833ce0ddec051af0b066b98d419f176db0664755bbf.lean#L185).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ed1f52ae89029d0a5f25173db8e311761130adb1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
