## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7f6fa2ff-5ab8-6361-7d28-fbe5e99409de`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–124.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem toΓSpecMapBasicOpen_eq : X.toΓSpecMapBasicOpen r = X.toRingedSpace.basicOpen r :=
  Opens.ext (X.toΓSpec_preim_basicOpen_eq r)
#align algebraic_geometry.LocallyRingedSpace.to_Γ_Spec_map_basic_open_eq AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.toΓSpecMapBasicOpen_eq

/-- The map from the global sections `Γ(X)` to the sections on the (preimage of) a basic open. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/GammaSpecAdjunction/Variant5820c5d3eb2fb57472aec23bff056cf34d5217233eaf16824a8d3577e455d1ca.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/GammaSpecAdjunction/Variant5820c5d3eb2fb57472aec23bff056cf34d5217233eaf16824a8d3577e455d1ca.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b6fbd7fd54059fc19b4a4117c86887875597888a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
