## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ec56283c-3e6a-4ed9-ecf4-8fee236cf47d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 219–229.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coconeOfRepresentable_naturality {P₁ P₂ : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ Type v₁} (α : P₁ ⟶ P₂) (j : P₁.Elementsᵒᵖ) :
    (coconeOfRepresentable P₁).ι.app j ≫ α =
      (coconeOfRepresentable P₂).ι.app ((CategoryOfElements.map α).op.obj j) := by
  ext T f
  simpa [coconeOfRepresentable_ι_app] using FunctorToTypes.naturality _ _ α f.op _

/-- The cocone with point `P` given by `coconeOfRepresentable` is a colimit:
that is, we have exhibited an arbitrary presheaf `P` as a colimit of representables.

The result of [MM92], Chapter I, Section 5, Corollary 3.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Presheaf/Variant7611c675d9d0ea15af47f2b0f9379c5858072e25e3a91fd1915287fdcf1351d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Presheaf/Variant7611c675d9d0ea15af47f2b0f9379c5858072e25e3a91fd1915287fdcf1351d7.lean#L219).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `accfc3d8296025cbdf3c5b552bc5329b8e5e2e6f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
