## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c70e46f9d26dcf877c0ac2649821b8f6cec6646928def6d3fbbd9407ce38c440`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 199–210.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def coconeOfRepresentable (P : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ Type v₁) :
    Cocone (functorToRepresentables P) where
  pt := P
  ι :=
    { app := fun x => yonedaEquiv.symm x.unop.2
      naturality := fun {x₁ x₂} f => by
        dsimp
        rw [comp_id, ← yonedaEquiv_symm_map]
        congr 1
        rw [f.unop.2] }

/-- The legs of the cocone `coconeOfRepresentable` are natural in the choice of presheaf. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Presheaf/Variant29d8cd1d54b5d0e4a122dc5f8d6b8742235e9fbd61a2e47e5c60b81027dc5584.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Presheaf/Variant29d8cd1d54b5d0e4a122dc5f8d6b8742235e9fbd61a2e47e5c60b81027dc5584.lean#L199).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac43a287dad7b1a0e1b11331b070f3c64e45d0a2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
