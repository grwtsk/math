## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5871da93e33f293e29753f031f9093540ceead412f006af724c95f3d08b1f9ed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 266–274.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance distribMulAction : DistribMulAction S <| (restrictScalars f).obj ⟨S⟩ →ₗ[R] M :=
  { CoextendScalars.mulAction f _ with
    smul_add := fun s g h => LinearMap.ext fun t : S => by simp
    smul_zero := fun s => LinearMap.ext fun t : S => by simp }
#align category_theory.Module.coextend_scalars.distrib_mul_action CategoryTheory.ModuleCat.CoextendScalars.distribMulAction

/-- `S` acts on Hom(S, M) by `s • g = x ↦ g (x • s)`, this action defines an `S`-module structure on
Hom(S, M).
 -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ChangeOfRings/Variant55647887f3ae0c9ed0c80973d90370f298f8536511bf3b2d2bf878bf28aaa570.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ChangeOfRings/Variant55647887f3ae0c9ed0c80973d90370f298f8536511bf3b2d2bf878bf28aaa570.lean#L266).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ddee0fd1ce72b50ccdb91956c214c2980ed3b477` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
