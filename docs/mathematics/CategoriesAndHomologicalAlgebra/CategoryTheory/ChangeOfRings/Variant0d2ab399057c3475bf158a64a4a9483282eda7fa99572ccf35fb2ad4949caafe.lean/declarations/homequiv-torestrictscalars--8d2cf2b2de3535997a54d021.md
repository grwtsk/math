## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9173699e0b25cbe7b749aab71551fe6194054270ecda85a8845dc00573f44726`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 702–721.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def HomEquiv.toRestrictScalars {X : ModuleCat R} {Y : ModuleCat S}
    (g : (extendScalars f).obj X ⟶ Y) :
    X ⟶ (restrictScalars f).obj Y :=
  -- TODO: after https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/19511 we need to hint `(Y := ...)`.
  -- This suggests `restrictScalars` needs to be redesigned.
  ofHom (Y := (restrictScalars f).obj Y)
  { toFun := fun x => g <| (1 : S) ⊗ₜ[R,f] x
    map_add' := fun _ _ => by dsimp; rw [tmul_add, map_add]
    map_smul' := fun r s => by
      dsimp
      rw [RestrictScalars.smul_def, ← LinearMap.map_smul]
      erw [tmul_smul]
      congr }

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ChangeOfRings/Variant0d2ab399057c3475bf158a64a4a9483282eda7fa99572ccf35fb2ad4949caafe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ChangeOfRings/Variant0d2ab399057c3475bf158a64a4a9483282eda7fa99572ccf35fb2ad4949caafe.lean#L702).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e8bef8c81dcc7ccc6a83544e71dff8c6c491851a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
