## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:580f10060df9c9be38e8b3367233ada2575d4cf13ef7b769d21609084c5bd3f9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 297–302.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def BinaryFan.mk {P : C} (π₁ : P ⟶ X) (π₂ : P ⟶ Y) : BinaryFan X Y where
  pt := P
  π := { app := fun | { as := j } => match j with | left => π₁ | right => π₂ }

/-- A binary cofan with vertex `P` consists of the two inclusions `ι₁ : X ⟶ P` and `ι₂ : Y ⟶ P`. -/
@[simps pt]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BinaryProducts/Variantc80afa4d60fc1d8440d405707db5099ed39d7c5f548a820e71c2d77603a74937.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BinaryProducts/Variantc80afa4d60fc1d8440d405707db5099ed39d7c5f548a820e71c2d77603a74937.lean#L297).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7e73a7e2bbae2297ba2a7b5666c19f2b8210925f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
