## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:914397689dff3c0ba422e972be8c327d6a23573245dacd3b995d5f389bdf5a8c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 653–668.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def Over.coprod [HasBinaryCoproducts C] {A : C} : Over A ⥤ Over A ⥤ Over A where
  obj f := Over.coprodObj f
  map k :=
    { app := fun g => Over.homMk (coprod.map k.left (𝟙 _)) (by
        dsimp; rw [coprod.map_desc, Category.id_comp, Over.w k])
      naturality := fun f g k => by
        ext
        simp }
  map_id X := by
    ext
    simp
  map_comp f g := by
    ext
    simp

end CategoryTheory
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BinaryProducts/Variant1a5e5a503cccdaef83dee8647823e0360835e33eaac952d4df9854dea8e20bca.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BinaryProducts/Variant1a5e5a503cccdaef83dee8647823e0360835e33eaac952d4df9854dea8e20bca.lean#L653).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a5e02f331b6bad70e42c2007eaceaf4aa7b73a7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
