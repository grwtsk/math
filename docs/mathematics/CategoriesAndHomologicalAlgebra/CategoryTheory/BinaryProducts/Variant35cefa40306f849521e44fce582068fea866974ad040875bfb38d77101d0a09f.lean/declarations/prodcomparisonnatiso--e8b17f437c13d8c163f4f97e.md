## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:982c950ee1150f01a83b52fea2cd4a16f4205893eaffb37908c061c0cfe94652`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1123–1128.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def prodComparisonNatIso [HasBinaryProducts C] [HasBinaryProducts D] (A : C)
    [∀ B, IsIso (prodComparison F A B)] :
    prod.functor.obj A ⋙ F ≅ F ⋙ prod.functor.obj (F.obj A) := by
  refine { @asIso _ _ _ _ _ (?_) with hom := prodComparisonNatTrans F A }
  apply NatIso.isIso_of_isIso_app

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BinaryProducts/Variant35cefa40306f849521e44fce582068fea866974ad040875bfb38d77101d0a09f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BinaryProducts/Variant35cefa40306f849521e44fce582068fea866974ad040875bfb38d77101d0a09f.lean#L1123).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d37bd955f38a3e476ad5121d1db346d4c969a9c5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
