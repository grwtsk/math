## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4ecc6fb9faa2f4a1a5bff666744d0039bd5c9962a81e62ef28185264a348ba56`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 191–202.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def colimitCoconeOfInitialAndPushouts [HasInitial C] [HasPushouts C]
    (F : Discrete WalkingPair ⥤ C) : ColimitCocone F where
  cocone :=
    { pt := pushout (initial.to (F.obj ⟨WalkingPair.left⟩)) (initial.to (F.obj ⟨WalkingPair.right⟩))
      ι :=
        Discrete.natTrans fun x =>
          Discrete.casesOn x fun x => WalkingPair.casesOn x (pushout.inl _ _) (pushout.inr _ _) }
  isColimit := isBinaryCoproductOfIsInitialIsPushout F _ initialIsInitial _ _ (pushoutIsPushout _ _)

variable (C) in
-- This is not an instance, as it is not always how one wants to construct binary coproducts!
/-- Any category with pushouts and initial object has binary coproducts. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BinaryProducts/Variant2eea3bccd96c55c6278b480f0b7d84cbfb1910020ca1b041bc614c08ef761228.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BinaryProducts/Variant2eea3bccd96c55c6278b480f0b7d84cbfb1910020ca1b041bc614c08ef761228.lean#L191).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `89d02148d7a274e23ed0a8ac50774abb76bab725` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
