## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7892e56299b6d22d1903ecc440883d1bbd464c491a6b7e65ab753e49e58e78b6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 229–239.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def isLimitEmptyConeEquiv (c₁ : Cone F₁) (c₂ : Cone F₂) (h : c₁.pt ≅ c₂.pt) :
    IsLimit c₁ ≃ IsLimit c₂ where
  toFun hl := isLimitChangeEmptyCone C hl c₂ h
  invFun hl := isLimitChangeEmptyCone C hl c₁ h.symm
  left_inv := by dsimp [Function.LeftInverse]; intro; simp only [eq_iff_true_of_subsingleton]
  right_inv := by
    dsimp [Function.LeftInverse,Function.RightInverse]; intro
    simp only [eq_iff_true_of_subsingleton]

/-- If `F` is an empty diagram, then a cone over `F` is limiting iff the cone point is terminal. -/
noncomputable
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsTerminal/Variant2809fdcfc5d670ce2b19bfd3f3ca1b72322db7bb45d604438ee860f728b891ed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsTerminal/Variant2809fdcfc5d670ce2b19bfd3f3ca1b72322db7bb45d604438ee860f728b891ed.lean#L229).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `19985040d5554b11fdd2e53f607f26c8b0969037` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
