## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2dc469f6-ee1b-94f3-1914-322616a67438`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 229–235.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsInitial.mono_from [InitialMonoClass C] {I} {X : C} (hI : IsInitial I) (f : I ⟶ X) :
    Mono f := by
  rw [hI.hom_ext f (hI.to X)]
  apply InitialMonoClass.isInitial_mono_from

/-- To show a category is an `InitialMonoClass` it suffices to give an initial object such that
every morphism out of it is a monomorphism. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsTerminal/Variantfbeed09479e7bfa8a0382bda474f2b59e068a98a5d9c5a56ffa560f7441ee899.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsTerminal/Variantfbeed09479e7bfa8a0382bda474f2b59e068a98a5d9c5a56ffa560f7441ee899.lean#L229).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e6ce53f60c8cc7bc88d0a485c58e68ac7b6c1c12` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
