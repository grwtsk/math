## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:37b6998d216376515dbaf8403699b6f721d347624224a5ddc1e58c177c7a9019`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 92–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {M N : C} [Mon_Class M] [Mon_Class N] (f : M ≅ N) [IsMon_Hom f.hom] :
   IsMon_Hom f.inv where
  one_hom := by simp [Iso.comp_inv_eq]
  mul_hom := by simp [Iso.comp_inv_eq]

variable (C) in
/-- A monoid object internal to a monoidal category.

When the monoidal category is preadditive, this is also sometimes called an "algebra object".
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Mon/Variant41cd7dbea5af9a108cc50b4d32008c4b483f6104ee5862c5b4d3b97e62e34e4c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Mon/Variant41cd7dbea5af9a108cc50b4d32008c4b483f6104ee5862c5b4d3b97e62e34e4c.lean#L92).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a24c902eff6112a61b8b3e122483a1035f2d2953` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
