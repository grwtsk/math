## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9c7362b6-6d45-f26d-2680-6177f1c25cf1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 323–342.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isSheaf_isSeparated {C : SmallCategory.{u, v}}
    {J : GrothendieckTopology C} {F : Presheaf.{u, v, w} C} :
    IsSheaf J F → IsSeparated J F := by
  intro hSheaf X S hS a b hlocal
  let m : MatchingFamily F S := {
    sectionAt := fun f _hf => Presheaf.res F f a
    compatible := by
      intro Y Z f hf g
      change F.map g (F.map f a) = F.map (C.comp g f) a
      exact (congrFun (F.map_comp f g) a).symm
  }
  rcases hSheaf S hS m with ⟨x, _hx, uniq⟩
  have ha : Amalgamates F a m := by
    intro Y f hf
    rfl
  have hb : Amalgamates F b m := by
    intro Y f hf
    exact (hlocal f hf).symm
  exact (uniq a ha).trans (uniq b hb).symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NativeSyntacticTopos/Variant93fc784e380be82de6be9599c8d0a97abdfb34e45a03ab66f4ebb3b85cb2d74b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NativeSyntacticTopos/Variant93fc784e380be82de6be9599c8d0a97abdfb34e45a03ab66f4ebb3b85cb2d74b.lean#L323).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `423dbf547c1240656d1117f5eb6f10595e8d6748` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
