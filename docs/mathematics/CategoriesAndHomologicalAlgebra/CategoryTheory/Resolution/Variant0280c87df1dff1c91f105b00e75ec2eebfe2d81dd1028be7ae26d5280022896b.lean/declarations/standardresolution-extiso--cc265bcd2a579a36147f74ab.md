## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:af4206d5f76830e8543e95c853c5a772b4a553079b785bc49646bd4f264354d6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 330–344.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def standardResolution.extIso (V : Rep k G) (n : ℕ) :
    ((Ext k (Rep k G) n).obj (Opposite.op <| Rep.trivial k G k)).obj V ≅
      ((standardComplex k G).linearYonedaObj k V).homology n :=
  (standardResolution k G).isoExt n V

namespace barComplex

open Rep Finsupp

variable (n)

/-- The differential from `Gⁿ⁺¹ →₀ k[G]` to `Gⁿ →₀ k[G]` in the bar resolution of `k` as a trivial
`k`-linear `G`-representation. It sends `(g₀, ..., gₙ)` to
`g₀·(g₁, ..., gₙ) + ∑ (-1)ʲ⁺¹·(g₀, ..., gⱼgⱼ₊₁, ..., gₙ) + (-1)ⁿ⁺¹·(g₀, ..., gₙ₋₁)` for
`j = 0, ..., n - 1`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Resolution/Variant0280c87df1dff1c91f105b00e75ec2eebfe2d81dd1028be7ae26d5280022896b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Resolution/Variant0280c87df1dff1c91f105b00e75ec2eebfe2d81dd1028be7ae26d5280022896b.lean#L330).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4090623d8bb6f4b1448591080bcb02470b7b2ff6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
