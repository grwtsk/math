## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e7f730061c6fac62b819982add115edc95b0e7eac67ce1cad27f48cd6b3a2b5a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 177–186.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Rep.standardComplex [Monoid G] :=
  (AlgebraicTopology.alternatingFaceMapComplex (Rep k G)).obj
    (classifyingSpaceUniversalCover G ⋙ linearization k G)

namespace Rep.standardComplex

open classifyingSpaceUniversalCover AlgebraicTopology CategoryTheory.Limits

/-- The `k`-linear map underlying the differential in the standard resolution of `k` as a trivial
`k`-linear `G`-representation. It sends `(g₀, ..., gₙ) ↦ ∑ (-1)ⁱ • (g₀, ..., ĝᵢ, ..., gₙ)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Resolution/Variant76e180441faa35b9b8266c1c5ce086b0ce8b4310cfcaa159f2bdafac9d623b89.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Resolution/Variant76e180441faa35b9b8266c1c5ce086b0ce8b4310cfcaa159f2bdafac9d623b89.lean#L177).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e434666d906e19735d3f51c8d78a6b6720cdbaa0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
