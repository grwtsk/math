## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:42a16dd745c92bde682d8ba00001aedbfce3c1680bf037589d83d5049fcca99d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 327–342.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def lift : s.pt ⟶ enrichedHom V F₁ F₂ :=
  end_.lift (fun j ↦ s.π.app j ≫ enrichedHomπ V _ _ (Under.mk (𝟙 j))) (fun j j' f ↦ by
    dsimp
    rw [← s.w f, assoc, assoc, assoc]
    -- this was produced by `simp?`
    simp only [functorEnrichedHom_obj, functorEnrichedHom_map, end_.lift_π_assoc, diagram_obj_obj,
      Functor.comp_obj, Under.forget_obj, Under.mk_right, Under.map_obj_right, Iso.refl_inv,
      NatTrans.id_app, eHomWhiskerRight_id, Iso.refl_hom, eHomWhiskerLeft_id, comp_id]
    have := enrichedHom_condition V (Under.forget j ⋙ F₁) (Under.forget j ⋙ F₂)
      (Under.homMk f : Under.mk (𝟙 j) ⟶ Under.mk f)
    dsimp at this
    rw [this]
    congr 3
    simp [Under.map, Comma.mapLeft]
    rfl)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FunctorCategory/Variantf5ce70a6d6814b364302cf0f7a86ee1021829301d1614bb8b5a8e7586bb9fa4f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FunctorCategory/Variantf5ce70a6d6814b364302cf0f7a86ee1021829301d1614bb8b5a8e7586bb9fa4f.lean#L327).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `964746b1888763c4112af60a841300762aca73ad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
