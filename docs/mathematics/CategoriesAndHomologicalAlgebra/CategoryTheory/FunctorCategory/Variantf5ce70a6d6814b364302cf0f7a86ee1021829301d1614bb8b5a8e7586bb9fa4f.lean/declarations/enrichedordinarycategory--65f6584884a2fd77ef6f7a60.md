## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:22e73a816ba0c86db11b51d5a9dd11c792028b8a06adb845c143e3c94c541a8f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 225–246.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def enrichedOrdinaryCategory [∀ (F₁ F₂ : J ⥤ C), HasEnrichedHom V F₁ F₂] :
    EnrichedOrdinaryCategory V (J ⥤ C) where
  Hom F₁ F₂ := enrichedHom V F₁ F₂
  id F := enrichedId V F
  comp F₁ F₂ F₃ := enrichedComp V F₁ F₂ F₃
  assoc _ _ _ _ := enriched_assoc _ _ _ _ _
  homEquiv := homEquiv V
  homEquiv_id _ := homEquiv_id V _
  homEquiv_comp f g := homEquiv_comp V f g

variable {J C}

section

variable (G : K ⥤ J) [HasEnrichedHom V F₁ F₂]

variable {F₁ F₂} in
/-- If `F₁` and `F₂` are functors `J ⥤ C`, `G : K ⥤ J`, and
`F₁'` and `F₂'` are functors `K ⥤ C` that are respectively
isomorphic to `G ⋙ F₁` and `G ⋙ F₂`, then this is the
induced morphism `enrichedHom V F₁ F₂ ⟶ enrichedHom V F₁' F₂'` in `V`
when `C` is a category enriched in `V`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FunctorCategory/Variantf5ce70a6d6814b364302cf0f7a86ee1021829301d1614bb8b5a8e7586bb9fa4f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FunctorCategory/Variantf5ce70a6d6814b364302cf0f7a86ee1021829301d1614bb8b5a8e7586bb9fa4f.lean#L225).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `964746b1888763c4112af60a841300762aca73ad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
