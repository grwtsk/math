## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:15373ee70ab9190576c5e8dd0518f319c787d3d40567f593f1e92cf5184ec3ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 200–212.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance evaluationPreservesLimitsOfShape [HasLimitsOfShape J C] (k : K) :
    PreservesLimitsOfShape J ((evaluation K C).obj k) where
  preservesLimit {F} := by
    -- Porting note: added a let because X was not inferred
    let X : (k:K) → LimitCone (Prefunctor.obj (Functor.flip F).toPrefunctor k) :=
      fun k => getLimitCone (Prefunctor.obj (Functor.flip F).toPrefunctor k)

      IsLimit.ofIsoLimit (limit.isLimit _) (evaluateCombinedCones F X k).symm
#align category_theory.limits.evaluation_preserves_limits_of_shape CategoryTheory.Limits.evaluationPreservesLimitsOfShape

/-- If `F : J ⥤ K ⥤ C` is a functor into a functor category which has a limit,
then the evaluation of that limit at `k` is the limit of the evaluations of `F.obj j` at `k`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FunctorCategory/Variantcc2d04996ca806d5d90c2c0d502a5d80990b306e2156349a80e3704c868ae7f8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FunctorCategory/Variantcc2d04996ca806d5d90c2c0d502a5d80990b306e2156349a80e3704c868ae7f8.lean#L200).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4dbebefbe5dc6f2ad3b7dcb411751419c7a9b4a1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
