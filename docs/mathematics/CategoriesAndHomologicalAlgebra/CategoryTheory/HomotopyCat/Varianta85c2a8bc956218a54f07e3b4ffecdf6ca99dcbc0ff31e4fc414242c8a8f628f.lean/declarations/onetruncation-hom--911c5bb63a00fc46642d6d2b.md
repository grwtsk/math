## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:383c68d5fe3f0fb640b3513e39a71542ecf1c42b12476dc4c033f911b81f9f68`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure OneTruncation₂.Hom {S : SSet.Truncated 2} (X Y : OneTruncation₂ S) where
  /-- An arrow in `OneTruncation₂.Hom X Y` includes the data of a 1-simplex. -/
  edge : S _⦋1⦌₂
  /-- An arrow in `OneTruncation₂.Hom X Y` includes a source equality. -/
  src_eq : S.map (δ₂ 1).op edge = X
  /-- An arrow in `OneTruncation₂.Hom X Y` includes a target equality. -/
  tgt_eq : S.map (δ₂ 0).op edge = Y

/-- A 2-truncated simplicial set `S` has an underlying refl quiver `SSet.OneTruncation₂ S`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HomotopyCat/Varianta85c2a8bc956218a54f07e3b4ffecdf6ca99dcbc0ff31e4fc414242c8a8f628f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HomotopyCat/Varianta85c2a8bc956218a54f07e3b4ffecdf6ca99dcbc0ff31e4fc414242c8a8f628f.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `69b86d6bb6331f2184e7ee447ebe2688df28aaac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
