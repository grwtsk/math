## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9aa3124d9454094ecd0c28d2673f3b028c5bfc74c344d1903fff189207a52727`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 128–135.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def effectiveEpiFamilyStructCompIso : EffectiveEpiFamilyStruct X (fun a ↦ π a ≫ i) where
  desc e h := inv i ≫ EffectiveEpiFamily.desc X π e (effectiveEpiFamilyStructCompIso_aux X π i e h)
  fac _ _ _ := by simp
  uniq e h m hm := by
    simp only [Category.assoc] at hm
    simp [← EffectiveEpiFamily.uniq X π e
      (effectiveEpiFamilyStructCompIso_aux X π i e h) (i ≫ m) hm]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Comp/Variant9fc771995ab981fc010c69f3a64cdb7e0bef1ac283de96524c00851d8ca2fa83.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Comp/Variant9fc771995ab981fc010c69f3a64cdb7e0bef1ac283de96524c00851d8ca2fa83.lean#L128).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4284db6872071bc5e9e05f35980d8b1c89c2d86c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
