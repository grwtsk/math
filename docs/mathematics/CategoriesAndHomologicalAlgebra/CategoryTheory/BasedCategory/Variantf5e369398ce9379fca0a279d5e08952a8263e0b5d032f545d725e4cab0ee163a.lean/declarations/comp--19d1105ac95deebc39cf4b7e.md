## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3b9084ba25ed73de670b283b2a94df6dbb8f54c9200294af95286450a5b27feb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 89–96.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def comp {𝒵 : BasedCategory.{v₄, u₄} 𝒮} (F : 𝒳 ⥤ᵇ 𝒴) (G : 𝒴 ⥤ᵇ 𝒵) : 𝒳 ⥤ᵇ 𝒵 where
  toFunctor := F.toFunctor ⋙ G.toFunctor
  w := by rw [Functor.assoc, G.w, F.w]

/-- Notation for composition of based functors. -/
scoped infixr:80 " ⋙ " => BasedFunctor.comp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BasedCategory/Variantf5e369398ce9379fca0a279d5e08952a8263e0b5d032f545d725e4cab0ee163a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BasedCategory/Variantf5e369398ce9379fca0a279d5e08952a8263e0b5d032f545d725e4cab0ee163a.lean#L89).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2b6c019d70ed69b0ff39daaf8c7c8ee081566e72` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
