## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:92221857b363c1f1c6d1079d73c30558a82697a6655e0e6f22365083306fa1d8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 111–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance preserves_isHomLift [IsHomLift 𝒳.p f φ] : IsHomLift 𝒴.p f (F.map φ) := by
  apply of_fac 𝒴.p f (F.map φ) (Eq.trans (F.w_obj a) (domain_eq 𝒳.p f φ))
    (Eq.trans (F.w_obj b) (codomain_eq 𝒳.p f φ))
  rw [← Functor.comp_map, congr_hom F.w]
  simpa using (fac 𝒳.p f φ)

/-- For a based functor `F : 𝒳 ⟶ 𝒴`, and an arrow `φ` in `𝒳`, then `φ` lifts an arrow `f` in `𝒮`
if `F(φ)` does. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BasedCategory/Variant3c98dafc025ed43abb68b95debad2cb0426e09998a7067f3089ca66244b8b30c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BasedCategory/Variant3c98dafc025ed43abb68b95debad2cb0426e09998a7067f3089ca66244b8b30c.lean#L111).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a41ad926d48b9690a539d2e3bd34b68c5bfee3f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
