## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:68a7f1377ab9fa203213cdb67c5de4758f531fd1d87e8d0ed60994f896a0ab97`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 59–68.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def adj : free ⊣ forget CommRingCat.{u} :=
  Adjunction.mkOfHomEquiv
    { homEquiv := fun _ _ ↦
        { toFun := fun f ↦ ↾(homEquiv f.hom)
          invFun := fun f ↦ ofHom <| homEquiv.symm f
          left_inv := fun f ↦ congrArg ofHom (homEquiv.left_inv f.hom)
          right_inv := by cat_disch }
      homEquiv_naturality_left_symm := fun {_ _ Y} f g =>
        hom_ext <| RingHom.ext fun x ↦ eval₂_cast_comp f (Int.castRingHom Y) g x }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Adjunctions/Variant680b8e06bc976ae22f0a202af8a09e56a2365471c4ce1e6809740972d7226bfc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Adjunctions/Variant680b8e06bc976ae22f0a202af8a09e56a2365471c4ce1e6809740972d7226bfc.lean#L59).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `39b4b1bc731bff1d8b9fff59638d7dc81b7cb435` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
