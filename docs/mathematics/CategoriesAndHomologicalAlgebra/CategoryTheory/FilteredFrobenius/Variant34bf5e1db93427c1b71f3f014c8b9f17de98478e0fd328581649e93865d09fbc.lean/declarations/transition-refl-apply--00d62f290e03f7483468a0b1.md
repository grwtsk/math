## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:00d7b840-05d9-ff34-745e-69ffcec3a9b2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–70.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem transition_refl_apply
    (r : Int)
    (A : P.DerivedAlgᵒᵖ) :
    (N.transition (le_refl r)).app A =
      𝟙 ((N.level r).obj A) := by
  exact congrArg (fun α ↦ α.app A) (N.transition_refl r)

end NygaardDatum

/--
A source comparison with explicit Frobenius and shifted-Nygaard coherence.

For `algebraMap : A ⟶ B`, contravariance makes `valueMap` point from the
value of `B` to the value of `A`.  At level `r`, `nygaardMap` lands in level
`r + filtrationShift`; shift zero is the filtration-preserving case.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FilteredFrobenius/Variant34bf5e1db93427c1b71f3f014c8b9f17de98478e0fd328581649e93865d09fbc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FilteredFrobenius/Variant34bf5e1db93427c1b71f3f014c8b9f17de98478e0fd328581649e93865d09fbc.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `067b07836ffb0d682cf1215111855e62818cdcfa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
