## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0dded5f3f08e1fdbfd3d983a6a57f378a0ffe7d00a0ba297d768629f398bb840`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 635–643.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [IsTriangulated C] [P.IsTriangulated] : P.trW.IsCompatibleWithTriangulation := ⟨by
  rintro T₁ T₃ mem₁ mem₃ a b ⟨Z₅, g₅, h₅, mem₅, mem₅'⟩ ⟨Z₄, g₄, h₄, mem₄, mem₄'⟩ comm
  obtain ⟨Z₂, g₂, h₂, mem₂⟩ := distinguished_cocone_triangle (T₁.mor₁ ≫ b)
  have H := someOctahedron rfl mem₁ mem₄ mem₂
  have H' := someOctahedron comm.symm mem₅ mem₃ mem₂
  let φ : T₁ ⟶ T₃ := H.triangleMorphism₁ ≫ H'.triangleMorphism₂
  exact ⟨φ.hom₃, P.trW.comp_mem _ _ (trW.mk P H.mem mem₄') (trW.mk' P H'.mem mem₅'),
    by simpa [φ] using φ.comm₂, by simpa [φ] using φ.comm₃⟩⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Subcategory/Variant58e20f6776141774e268244025ec4c3f8f7a91bd80b824b634d2b4c7a51f047b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Subcategory/Variant58e20f6776141774e268244025ec4c3f8f7a91bd80b824b634d2b4c7a51f047b.lean#L635).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `759c0feaf72a037ccb164922c16fae1aea809c53` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
