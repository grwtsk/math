## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:06a28378fb7287d127ac453e973d55ec346f6c8985b0cb61eb2e34e5cedbd2c6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 53–59.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (B : C) : (preadditiveYoneda.obj B).IsHomological where
  exact T hT := by
    rw [ShortComplex.ab_exact_iff]
    intro (x₂ : T.obj₂.unop ⟶ B) (hx₂ : T.mor₂.unop ≫ x₂ = 0)
    obtain ⟨x₃, hx₃⟩ := Triangle.yoneda_exact₂ _ (unop_distinguished T hT) x₂ hx₂
    exact ⟨x₃, hx₃.symm⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Yoneda/Variant79993ff6a9a1f16c6b72e98669ae9058e5f769439d7e769726c5142465240839.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Yoneda/Variant79993ff6a9a1f16c6b72e98669ae9058e5f769439d7e769726c5142465240839.lean#L53).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5990fb38a21ae0f12db4acc3091319bc3344d34c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
