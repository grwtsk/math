## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:105d3a3f-c498-d44e-ff1b-91886dc8f972`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 439–448.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma spine_δ_arrow_eq (h : j = i.succ.castSucc) :
    (X.spine n (X.δ j (sx.spineToSimplex f))).arrow i =
      sx.spineToDiagonal (f.interval i 2 (by lia)) := by
  simp only [SimplicialObject.δ, spine_arrow]
  rw [← Functor.map_comp_apply, ← op_comp]
  rw [mkOfSucc_δ_eq h, spineToSimplex_edge]

end StrictSegal

/-- Helper structure in order to show that a simplicial set is strict Segal. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/StrictSegal/Variant29dd7c81d274f65d0f11859bf889621f21faa3aa63a9b8c9bbe2d333c852c7fb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/StrictSegal/Variant29dd7c81d274f65d0f11859bf889621f21faa3aa63a9b8c9bbe2d333c852c7fb.lean#L439).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
