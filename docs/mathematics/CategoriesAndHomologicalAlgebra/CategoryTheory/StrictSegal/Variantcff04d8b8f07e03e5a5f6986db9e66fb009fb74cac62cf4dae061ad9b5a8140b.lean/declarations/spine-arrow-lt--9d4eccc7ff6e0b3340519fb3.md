## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a381f6ed-0657-937c-1756-72cd743b6a8c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 185–193.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma spine_δ_arrow_lt (hij : i.succ.castSucc < j) :
    (X.spine m _ (X.map (tr (δ j)).op
      (sx.spineToSimplex (m + 1) _ f))).arrow i = f.arrow i.castSucc := by
  rw [spine_arrow, ← FunctorToTypes.map_comp_apply, ← op_comp, ← tr_comp,
    mkOfSucc_δ_lt hij, spineToSimplex_arrow]

/-- If we take the path along the spine of the `j`th face of a `spineToSimplex`,
an arrow `i` with `i + 1 > j` can be identified with arrow `i + 1` in the
original path. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/StrictSegal/Variantcff04d8b8f07e03e5a5f6986db9e66fb009fb74cac62cf4dae061ad9b5a8140b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/StrictSegal/Variantcff04d8b8f07e03e5a5f6986db9e66fb009fb74cac62cf4dae061ad9b5a8140b.lean#L185).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d1598c3ddb4d30b6b7e6b71734f5f9a78c4d68f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
