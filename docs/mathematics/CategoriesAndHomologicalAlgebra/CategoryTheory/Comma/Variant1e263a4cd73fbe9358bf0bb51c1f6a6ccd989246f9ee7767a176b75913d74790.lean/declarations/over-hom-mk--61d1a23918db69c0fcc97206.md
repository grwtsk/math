## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b701068d9e5b6241adf570203e2e484c7a9c180706d515486788a77bb80aa3b2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 629–637.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Over.Hom.mk {A B : P.Over Q X}
    (f : (Over.forget _ _ _).obj A ⟶ (Over.forget _ _ _).obj B) (hf : Q f.left) : A ⟶ B where
  __ := f
  prop_hom_left := hf
  prop_hom_right := trivial

variable (Q) in
/-- Make an object of `P.Over Q X` from a morphism `f : A ⟶ X` and a proof of `P f`. -/
@[simps hom left]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Comma/Variant1e263a4cd73fbe9358bf0bb51c1f6a6ccd989246f9ee7767a176b75913d74790.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Comma/Variant1e263a4cd73fbe9358bf0bb51c1f6a6ccd989246f9ee7767a176b75913d74790.lean#L629).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b9ed750bc5ba48fd64d0d9b5373353575df2584f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
