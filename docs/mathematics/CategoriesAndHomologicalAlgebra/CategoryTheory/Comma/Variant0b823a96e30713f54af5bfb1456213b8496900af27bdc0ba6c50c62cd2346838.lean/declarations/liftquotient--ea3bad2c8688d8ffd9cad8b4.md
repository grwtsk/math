## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ee72691b15114aa65a60f4d2721b4adc1e15b30b16b5b529e0e5087118246157`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 169–175.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def liftQuotient {A : CostructuredArrow S T} (P : Subobject (op A.left)) {q}
    (hq : S.map P.arrow.unop ≫ q = A.hom) : Subobject (op A) :=
  Subobject.mk (homMk P.arrow.unop hq : A ⟶ mk q).op
#align category_theory.costructured_arrow.lift_quotient CategoryTheory.CostructuredArrow.liftQuotient

/-- Technical lemma for `lift_projectQuotient`. -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Comma/Variant0b823a96e30713f54af5bfb1456213b8496900af27bdc0ba6c50c62cd2346838.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Comma/Variant0b823a96e30713f54af5bfb1456213b8496900af27bdc0ba6c50c62cd2346838.lean#L169).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4d9efff285e12caf400aa98dbfcd07e1e733e37f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
