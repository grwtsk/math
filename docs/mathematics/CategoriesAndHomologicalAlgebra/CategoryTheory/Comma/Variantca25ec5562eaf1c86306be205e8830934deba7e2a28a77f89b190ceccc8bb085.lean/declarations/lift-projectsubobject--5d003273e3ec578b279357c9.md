## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:86031f2f-b44e-986c-f525-bd7339a7a877`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 92–108.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lift_projectSubobject [HasFiniteLimits C] [PreservesFiniteLimits T]
    {A : StructuredArrow S T} :
    ∀ (P : Subobject A) {q} (hq : q ≫ T.map (projectSubobject P).arrow = A.hom),
      liftSubobject (projectSubobject P) hq = P :=
  Subobject.ind _
    (by
      intro P f hf q hq

        · exact (cancel_mono (T.map f.right)).1 (by dsimp; simpa [← T.map_comp] using hq)
      · exact ext _ _ (by simp))

/-- If `A : S → T.obj B` is a structured arrow for `S : D` and `T : C ⥤ D`, then we can explicitly
    describe the subobjects of `A` as the subobjects `P` of `B` in `C` for which `A.hom` factors
    through the image of `P` under `T`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Comma/Variantca25ec5562eaf1c86306be205e8830934deba7e2a28a77f89b190ceccc8bb085.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Comma/Variantca25ec5562eaf1c86306be205e8830934deba7e2a28a77f89b190ceccc8bb085.lean#L92).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fee4f1f5a92a2b108022dd7b7a7dd07ed3330188` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
