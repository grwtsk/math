## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5ffd6e00d3475b91525e8b4ddf6ef86c6e24ad855562d30468c1a1e4ede5494c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 224–232.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def π₁ : J κ f ⥤ J₁ κ f where
  obj g := g.fst
  map φ := CostructuredArrow.homMk (ObjectProperty.homMk (by exact φ.left.hom.left))
    (by exact congr_arg CommaMorphism.left (CostructuredArrow.w φ))

/-- The second projection `J κ f ⥤ J₂ κ f`. (Note: this functor could be
defined using `CostructuredArrow.map₂`, but it would not have the same
definitional properties.) -/
@[implicit_reducible, simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Comma/Variantb5b44920da24a21b4ab4a7eb069ff5b7e4407afacbba76205864e76a9b5dff1b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Comma/Variantb5b44920da24a21b4ab4a7eb069ff5b7e4407afacbba76205864e76a9b5dff1b.lean#L224).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e236b1ee32fcb3a431bb977f90a0eeedbda6db35` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
