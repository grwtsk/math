## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cfaeb011-46e7-22f0-519f-7d8d187435fc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 481–489.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma homologyMap_eq :
    homologyMap φ = h₁.homologyIso.hom ≫ γ.φH ≫ h₂.homologyIso.inv := by
  dsimp [homologyMap, homologyMap', RightHomologyData.homologyIso,
    rightHomologyIso, RightHomologyData.rightHomologyIso]
  have γ' : HomologyMapData φ S₁.homologyData S₂.homologyData := default
  simp only [← γ.rightHomologyMap'_eq, assoc, ← rightHomologyMap'_comp_assoc,
    id_comp, comp_id, γ'.left.leftHomologyMap'_eq, γ'.right.rightHomologyMap'_eq, ← γ'.comm_assoc,
    Iso.hom_inv_id]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Homology/Variantdd6997af035b48adedaaefe9cc75c27fa628e090f2032c1ce7e7e20e998f67ef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Homology/Variantdd6997af035b48adedaaefe9cc75c27fa628e090f2032c1ce7e7e20e998f67ef.lean#L481).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `deb9d618262e919e690bb9b05f394b56ab67b91a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
