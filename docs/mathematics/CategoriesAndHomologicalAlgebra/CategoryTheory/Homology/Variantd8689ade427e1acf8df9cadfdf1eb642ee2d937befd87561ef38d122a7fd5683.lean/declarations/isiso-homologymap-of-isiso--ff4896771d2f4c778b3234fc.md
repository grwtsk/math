## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bf9c24552a5b35e79798d0bdbe774d068ea43a69e080f828ea31c60a63225de4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 865–875.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isIso_homologyMap_of_isIso (φ : S₁ ⟶ S₂) [S₁.HasHomology] [S₂.HasHomology] [IsIso φ] :
    IsIso (homologyMap φ) := by
  dsimp only [homologyMap, homologyMap']
  infer_instance

section

variable (S) {A : C}
variable [HasHomology S]

/-- The canonical morphism `S.cycles ⟶ S.homology` for a short complex `S` that has homology. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Homology/Variantd8689ade427e1acf8df9cadfdf1eb642ee2d937befd87561ef38d122a7fd5683.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Homology/Variantd8689ade427e1acf8df9cadfdf1eb642ee2d937befd87561ef38d122a7fd5683.lean#L865).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `12b71a88e6b6e8c53e5abe4e794864e7d653e664` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
