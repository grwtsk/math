## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a103d960647cfc681aa29c59af3046841233a45fcb728ed72415c8eb28e55fd9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 89–98.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class IsPreservedBy (F : C ⥤ D) (K : GrothendieckTopology D) : Prop where
  mem₀ : (E.toPreOneHypercover.map F).sieve₀ ∈ K (F.obj X)
  mem₁ (i₁ i₂ : E.I₀) ⦃W : D⦄ (p₁ : W ⟶ F.obj (E.X i₁)) (p₂ : W ⟶ F.obj (E.X i₂))
    (w : p₁ ≫ F.map (E.f i₁) = p₂ ≫ F.map (E.f i₂)) :
      (E.toPreOneHypercover.map F).sieve₁ p₁ p₂ ∈ K W

/-- Given a 1-hypercover `E : J.OneHypercover X` of an object of `C`, a functor `F : C ⥤ D`
such that `E.IsPreversedBy F K` for a Grothendieck topology `K` on `D`, this is
the image of `E` by `F`, as a 1-hypercover of `F.obj X` for `K`. -/
@[simps toPreOneHypercover]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Continuous/Variant93f4117c23a18fe8f5ce690a84437d02adf3d2c1cabe9955ab586e2793f2dc05.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Continuous/Variant93f4117c23a18fe8f5ce690a84437d02adf3d2c1cabe9955ab586e2793f2dc05.lean#L89).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f9d89636315aaff22e560c5c50cfdbab3fce633e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
