## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5ad71f44e924c062ba7201502391c0355cb9d0ba21016556543f203f3682b71d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–105.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkHasForget₂ {d : Type u → Type u} {hom_d : ∀ ⦃α β : Type u⦄ (_ : d α) (_ : d β), Type u}
    [BundledHom hom_d] (obj : ∀ ⦃α⦄, c α → d α)
    (map : ∀ {X Y : Bundled c}, (X ⟶ Y) → (Bundled.map @obj X ⟶ (Bundled.map @obj Y)))
    (h_map : ∀ {X Y : Bundled c} (f : X ⟶ Y), ⇑(map f) = ⇑f) :
    HasForget₂ (Bundled c) (Bundled d) :=
  HasForget₂.mk' (Bundled.map @obj) (fun _ => rfl) map (by
    intros X Y f
    rw [heq_eq_eq, forget_map_eq_coe, forget_map_eq_coe, h_map f])

variable {d : Type u → Type u}
variable (hom)

section

/-- The `hom` corresponding to first forgetting along `F`, then taking the `hom` associated to `c`.

For typical usage, see the construction of `CommMonCat` from `MonCat`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BundledHom/Variantb1a37da003ce3a492d2e02ea8ad4044b3b97389526b11485f5f8a12c2af2a13b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BundledHom/Variantb1a37da003ce3a492d2e02ea8ad4044b3b97389526b11485f5f8a12c2af2a13b.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e11132d51ad19236ce7d0c9bab04474801e231f4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
