## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:50a604fc90a544de8d350bb80fb051e8ab92bfc4ab821b40b0bc23f2663499b6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def op : Triple H.op G.op F.op where
  adj₁ := t.adj₂.op
  adj₂ := t.adj₁.op

section InnerFullyFaithful

variable [G.Full] [G.Faithful]

/-- The natural transformation `H ⟶ F` that exists for every adjoint triple `F ⊣ G ⊣ H` where `G`
is fully faithful, given here as the preimage of `adj₂.counit ≫ adj₁.unit : H ⋙ G ⟶ F ⋙ G`
under whiskering with `G`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Triple/Variant3de6e854aee583e3bd941803b8d6728564db6ae76a30d341e71b7b18a8ee4e6a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Triple/Variant3de6e854aee583e3bd941803b8d6728564db6ae76a30d341e71b7b18a8ee4e6a.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `590068e8d75e42a0846ad2cd59d59393cf2d2fd3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
