## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b1e661f04db2c3e754a11b563231aa55fb9c9bf6c9bfa8282c65b46c58e277bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 181–197.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance cyclesFunctor_additive [HasKernels C] [HasCokernels C] :
  (cyclesFunctor C).Additive where

end LeftHomology


section RightHomology

variable {φ φ' : S₁ ⟶ S₂} {h₁ : S₁.RightHomologyData} {h₂ : S₂.RightHomologyData}

namespace RightHomologyMapData

variable (γ : RightHomologyMapData φ h₁ h₂) (γ' : RightHomologyMapData φ' h₁ h₂)

/-- Given a right homology map data for morphism `φ`, this is the induced right homology
map data for `-φ`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Preadditive/Variantac25fa387aeb28bf0dade589983dc6cbedadfee310c3db52e05c5d34352477fd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Preadditive/Variantac25fa387aeb28bf0dade589983dc6cbedadfee310c3db52e05c5d34352477fd.lean#L181).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5ff2aef1454d2c0355f6fa61ad10736bad67186f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
