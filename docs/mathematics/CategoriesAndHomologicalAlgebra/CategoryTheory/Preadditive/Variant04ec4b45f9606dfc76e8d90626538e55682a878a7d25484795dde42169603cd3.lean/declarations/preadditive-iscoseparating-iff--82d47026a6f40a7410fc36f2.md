## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:683783ed-d808-2d49-25cf-af32eab26c87`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 39–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Preadditive.isCoseparating_iff (𝒢 : Set C) :
    IsCoseparating 𝒢 ↔ ∀ ⦃X Y : C⦄ (f : X ⟶ Y), (∀ G ∈ 𝒢, ∀ (h : Y ⟶ G), f ≫ h = 0) → f = 0 :=
  ⟨fun h𝒢 X Y f hf => h𝒢 _ _ (by simpa only [Limits.zero_comp] using hf), fun h𝒢 X Y f g hfg =>
    sub_eq_zero.1 <| h𝒢 _ (by simpa only [Preadditive.sub_comp, sub_eq_zero] using hfg)⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Preadditive/Variant04ec4b45f9606dfc76e8d90626538e55682a878a7d25484795dde42169603cd3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Preadditive/Variant04ec4b45f9606dfc76e8d90626538e55682a878a7d25484795dde42169603cd3.lean#L39).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8de606d58c913af9e409b98acbd775d0c78f417c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
