## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:60724099-bd34-b1e1-274e-ddadac112cc4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 221–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma add'_map (f₁ f₂ : X ⟶ Y) :
    add' W (L.map f₁) (L.map f₂) = L.map (f₁ + f₂) :=
  (add'_eq W (L.map f₁) (L.map f₂) (LeftFraction₂.mk f₁ f₂ (𝟙 _) (W.id_mem _))
    (LeftFraction.map_ofHom _ _ _ _).symm (LeftFraction.map_ofHom _ _ _ _).symm).trans
    (LeftFraction.map_ofHom _ _ _ _)

variable (L X Y)

/-- The abelian group structure on `L.obj X ⟶ L.obj Y` when `L : C ⥤ D` is a localization
functor, `C` is preadditive and there is a left calculus of fractions. -/
@[instance_reducible]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Preadditive/Variante54d38a671f284d70334f0002993ec8599d99c322cf5ff8c48c63c8bec7a2750.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Preadditive/Variante54d38a671f284d70334f0002993ec8599d99c322cf5ff8c48c63c8bec7a2750.lean#L221).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f195bb716ca5dbb9b6e2a5f98175fe9485e86bb0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
