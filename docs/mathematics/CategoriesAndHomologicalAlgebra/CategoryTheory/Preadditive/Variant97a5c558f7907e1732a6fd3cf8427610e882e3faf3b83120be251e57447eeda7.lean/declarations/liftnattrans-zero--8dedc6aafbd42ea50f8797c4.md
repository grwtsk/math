## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3ca9b26f-e458-2c52-0567-b65c0c6c2014`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 32–39.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma liftNatTrans_zero (F₁ F₂ : C ⥤ E) (F₁' F₂' : D ⥤ E)
    [Lifting L W F₁ F₁'] [Lifting L W F₂ F₂']
    [HasZeroMorphisms E] :
    liftNatTrans L W F₁ F₂ F₁' F₂' 0 = 0 :=
  natTrans_ext L W (by simp)

variable [Preadditive E]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Preadditive/Variant97a5c558f7907e1732a6fd3cf8427610e882e3faf3b83120be251e57447eeda7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Preadditive/Variant97a5c558f7907e1732a6fd3cf8427610e882e3faf3b83120be251e57447eeda7.lean#L32).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9da667209bf50554b14b149ca717971099e30bc3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
