## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ff353e90-b7bb-16ff-781a-0f168e97e61f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 278–290.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma mulRight_one (A : C) [GrpObj A] : mulRight η[A] = Iso.refl A := by
  ext; simp

/-- The associativity diagram of a group object is Cartesian.

In fact, any monoid object whose associativity diagram is Cartesian can be made into a group object
(we do not prove this in this file), so we should expect that many properties of group objects
follow from this result. -/
@[to_additive /-- The associativity diagram of an additive group object is Cartesian.

In fact, any additive monoid object whose associativity diagram is Cartesian can be made into an
additive group object (we do not prove this in this file), so we should expect that many properties
of additive group objects follow from this result. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Grp/Variant3d789a7817624111c521b1196d9518be9cebc11fe128ef369ff2663362d13f6e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Grp/Variant3d789a7817624111c521b1196d9518be9cebc11fe128ef369ff2663362d13f6e.lean#L278).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9b77b60395bf5488948106dd5c1597a6ec6dd700` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
