## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b6b9a23954dae59a3258f36658bf9b80602a477f164b82406b343c4d867dda30`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 616–625.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected instance Faithful.mapGrp [F.Faithful] : F.mapGrp.Faithful where
  map_injective hfg :=
    (Grp.forget₂Mon _).map_injective
      (F.mapMon.map_injective ((Grp.forget₂Mon _).congr_map hfg))

set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency.types false in
/-- If `F : C ⥤ D` is a fully faithful monoidal functor, then
`F.mapGrp : Grp C ⥤ Grp D` is fully faithful too. -/
@[to_additive /-- If `F : C ⥤ D` is a fully faithful monoidal functor, then
`F.mapAddGrp : AddGrp C ⥤ AddGrp D` is fully faithful too. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Grp/Variant3d789a7817624111c521b1196d9518be9cebc11fe128ef369ff2663362d13f6e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Grp/Variant3d789a7817624111c521b1196d9518be9cebc11fe128ef369ff2663362d13f6e.lean#L616).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9b77b60395bf5488948106dd5c1597a6ec6dd700` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
