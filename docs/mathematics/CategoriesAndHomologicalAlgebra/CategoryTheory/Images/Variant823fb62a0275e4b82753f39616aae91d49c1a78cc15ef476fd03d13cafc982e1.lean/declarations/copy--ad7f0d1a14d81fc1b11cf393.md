## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6b39087b8f664830b4263984c80918c96a55a2541e3555e432fa55d2d5da3ce3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 270–279.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def copy {F : MonoFactorisation f} (hF : IsImage F) (m : F.I ⟶ Y) (e : X ⟶ F.I)
    (hm : m = F.m := by cat_disch) (he : e = F.e := by cat_disch) :
    IsImage (F.copy m e) where
  lift := hF.lift

end IsImage

variable (f)

/-- Data exhibiting that a morphism `f` has an image. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Images/Variant823fb62a0275e4b82753f39616aae91d49c1a78cc15ef476fd03d13cafc982e1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Images/Variant823fb62a0275e4b82753f39616aae91d49c1a78cc15ef476fd03d13cafc982e1.lean#L270).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e9eb35a6ce94bd3c53eebd289e9b1cb48e42a036` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
