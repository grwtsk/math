## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c5363003fcc2747853b0305ff432b2bdab192c35f6ddb389593c686060d11b69`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 503–524.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (h : f = f') : IsIso (image.eqToHom h) :=
  ⟨⟨image.eqToHom h.symm,
      ⟨(cancel_mono (image.ι f)).1 (by
          -- Porting note: added let's for used to be a simp[image.eqToHom]
          let F : MonoFactorisation f' :=
            ⟨image f, image.ι f, factorThruImage f, (by aesop_cat)⟩
          dsimp [image.eqToHom]
          rw [Category.id_comp,Category.assoc,image.lift_fac F]
          let F' : MonoFactorisation f :=
            ⟨image f', image.ι f', factorThruImage f', (by aesop_cat)⟩
          rw [image.lift_fac F'] ),
        (cancel_mono (image.ι f')).1 (by
          -- Porting note: added let's for used to be a simp[image.eqToHom]
          let F' : MonoFactorisation f :=
            ⟨image f', image.ι f', factorThruImage f', (by aesop_cat)⟩
          dsimp [image.eqToHom]
          rw [Category.id_comp,Category.assoc,image.lift_fac F']
          let F : MonoFactorisation f' :=
            ⟨image f, image.ι f, factorThruImage f, (by aesop_cat)⟩
          rw [image.lift_fac F])⟩⟩⟩

/-- An equation between morphisms gives an isomorphism between the images. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Images/Variantaf70105f2b7d5c17353cdc052f8da15388f9ae5401811782b29c20c99b9e1cc5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Images/Variantaf70105f2b7d5c17353cdc052f8da15388f9ae5401811782b29c20c99b9e1cc5.lean#L503).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5799f5f17fe78ff97a16424cdd949070e746095c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
