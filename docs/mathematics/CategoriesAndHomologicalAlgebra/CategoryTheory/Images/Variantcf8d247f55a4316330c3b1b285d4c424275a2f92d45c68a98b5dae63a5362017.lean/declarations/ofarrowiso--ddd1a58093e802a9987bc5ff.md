## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:44fe19fead76db0c5bb226194b434de26ed632094a80cab8cfedc61394d2e418`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 156–168.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofArrowIso {f g : Arrow C} (F : MonoFactorisation f.hom) (sq : f ⟶ g) [IsIso sq] :
    MonoFactorisation g.hom where
  I := F.I
  m := F.m ≫ sq.right
  e := inv sq.left ≫ F.e
  m_mono := mono_comp _ _
  fac := by simp only [fac_assoc, Arrow.w, IsIso.inv_comp_eq, Category.assoc]

end MonoFactorisation

variable {f}

/-- Data exhibiting that a given factorisation through a mono is initial. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Images/Variantcf8d247f55a4316330c3b1b285d4c424275a2f92d45c68a98b5dae63a5362017.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Images/Variantcf8d247f55a4316330c3b1b285d4c424275a2f92d45c68a98b5dae63a5362017.lean#L156).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fbb2cbb450c2e31ed532d75a8aa84ee99835b9bb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
