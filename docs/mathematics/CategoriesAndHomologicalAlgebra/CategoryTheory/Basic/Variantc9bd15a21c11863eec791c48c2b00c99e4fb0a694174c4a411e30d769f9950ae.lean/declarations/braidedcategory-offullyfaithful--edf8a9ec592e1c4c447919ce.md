## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c0adb88d814bba8042c702c0788a47a258be9285d0443bbd4dc838e9e0277893`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 264–285.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def BraidedCategory.ofFullyFaithful {C D : Type*} [Category* C] [Category* D]
    [MonoidalCategory C] [MonoidalCategory D] (F : C ⥤ D) [F.Monoidal] [F.Full]
    [F.Faithful] [BraidedCategory D] : BraidedCategory C :=
  .ofFaithful F fun X Y ↦ F.preimageIso ((μIso F _ _).symm ≪≫ β_ (F.obj X) (F.obj Y) ≪≫ μIso F _ _)

section

/-!
We now establish how the braiding interacts with the unitors.

I couldn't find a detailed proof in print, but this is discussed in:

* Proposition 1 of André Joyal and Ross Street,
  "Braided monoidal categories", Macquarie Math Reports 860081 (1986).
* Proposition 2.1 of André Joyal and Ross Street,
  "Braided tensor categories", Adv. Math. 102 (1993), 20–78.
* Exercise 8.1.6 of Etingof, Gelaki, Nikshych, Ostrik,
  "Tensor categories", vol 25, Mathematical Surveys and Monographs (2015), AMS.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantc9bd15a21c11863eec791c48c2b00c99e4fb0a694174c4a411e30d769f9950ae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantc9bd15a21c11863eec791c48c2b00c99e4fb0a694174c4a411e30d769f9950ae.lean#L264).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9c51dc420e2fde22614285fbab50ce82d1fb4c5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
