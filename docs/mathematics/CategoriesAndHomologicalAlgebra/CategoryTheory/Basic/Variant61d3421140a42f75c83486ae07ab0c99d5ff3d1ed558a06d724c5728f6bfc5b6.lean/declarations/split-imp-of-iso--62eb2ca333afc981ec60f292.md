## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:05c5cc39-6f2a-e095-e29e-c0ff060e158d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 131–138.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem split_imp_of_iso {X X' : C} (φ : X ≅ X') (p : X ⟶ X) (p' : X' ⟶ X')
    (hpp' : p ≫ φ.hom = φ.hom ≫ p')
    (h : ∃ (Y : C) (i : Y ⟶ X) (e : X ⟶ Y), i ≫ e = 𝟙 Y ∧ e ≫ i = p) :
    ∃ (Y' : C) (i' : Y' ⟶ X') (e' : X' ⟶ Y'), i' ≫ e' = 𝟙 Y' ∧ e' ≫ i' = p' := by
  rcases h with ⟨Y, i, e, ⟨h₁, h₂⟩⟩
  use Y, i ≫ φ.hom, φ.inv ≫ e
  grind

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant61d3421140a42f75c83486ae07ab0c99d5ff3d1ed558a06d724c5728f6bfc5b6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant61d3421140a42f75c83486ae07ab0c99d5ff3d1ed558a06d724c5728f6bfc5b6.lean#L131).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `41e7bc9075f9f2b2366788db82ee44101a986fdc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
