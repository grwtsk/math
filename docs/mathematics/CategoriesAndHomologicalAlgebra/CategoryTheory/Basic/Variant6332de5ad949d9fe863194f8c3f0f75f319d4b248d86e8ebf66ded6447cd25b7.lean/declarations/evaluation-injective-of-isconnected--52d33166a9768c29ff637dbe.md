## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:88fdf914-3ae3-8256-1709-d25f9b5d66f6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 312–320.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma evaluation_injective_of_isConnected (A X : C) [IsConnected A] (a : F.obj A) :
    Function.Injective (fun (f : A ⟶ X) ↦ F.map f a) := by
  intro f g (h : F.map f a = F.map g a)
  haveI : IsIso (equalizer.ι f g) := by
    apply IsConnected.noTrivialComponent _ (equalizer.ι f g)
    exact not_initial_of_inhabited F ((fiberEqualizerEquiv F f g).symm ⟨a, h⟩)
  exact eq_of_epi_equalizer

/-- The evaluation map on automorphisms is injective for connected objects. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant6332de5ad949d9fe863194f8c3f0f75f319d4b248d86e8ebf66ded6447cd25b7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant6332de5ad949d9fe863194f8c3f0f75f319d4b248d86e8ebf66ded6447cd25b7.lean#L312).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7d16013b86fdcff78db9ad98331974958f929f69` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
