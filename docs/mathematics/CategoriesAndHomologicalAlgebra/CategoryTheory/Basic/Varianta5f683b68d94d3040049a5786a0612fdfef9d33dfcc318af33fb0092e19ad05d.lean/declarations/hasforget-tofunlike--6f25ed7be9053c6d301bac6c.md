## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4ea961e21495e7ed93498fff8ea9d7d6511fdefaf86dfe00efb496a7b54b31bf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 390–402.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev HasForget.toFunLike [HasForget C] (X Y : C) :
    FunLike (X ⟶ Y) ((forget C).obj X) ((forget C).obj Y) where
  coe := (forget C).map
  coe_injective' _ _ h := Functor.Faithful.map_injective h

/-- Build a concrete category out of `HasForget`.

The intended usecase is to prove theorems referencing only `(forget C)`
and not `(forget C).obj X` nor `(forget C).map f`: those should be written
as `ToType X` and `ConcreteCategory.hom f` respectively.

See note [reducible non-instances].

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Varianta5f683b68d94d3040049a5786a0612fdfef9d33dfcc318af33fb0092e19ad05d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Varianta5f683b68d94d3040049a5786a0612fdfef9d33dfcc318af33fb0092e19ad05d.lean#L390).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `806e2c55258cbd3d6165f5b3d975d9768ead9ca3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
