## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5a6541457b50c37a7f76efbb8ce79e1c15b01e76f971d60f328229d1e7b480e4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 401–410.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public noncomputable def functor :
    Subtype (IsCardinalFilteredAndHasCardinalLT κ₁ κ₂ J) ⥤ C where
  obj A := colimit κ₁ κ₂ p A
  map f := colimit.map κ₁ κ₂ p f.le
  map_id _ := by ext; simp
  map_comp f g := by ext; simp

set_option backward.defeqAttrib.useBackward true in
/-- The cocone for `functor κ₁ κ₂ p` with point `X`. -/
@[expose, simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantf6fa213252611d13e5cc2cf6961412b5f5908b0c88048c4294c94ed30a182834.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantf6fa213252611d13e5cc2cf6961412b5f5908b0c88048c4294c94ed30a182834.lean#L401).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4ec2ea780a4adb599c4ec4f7344924af4947adee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
