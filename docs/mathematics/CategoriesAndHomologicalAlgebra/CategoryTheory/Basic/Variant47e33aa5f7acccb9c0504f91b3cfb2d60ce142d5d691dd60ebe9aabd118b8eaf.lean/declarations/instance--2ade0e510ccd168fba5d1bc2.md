## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a9070407d0060baefba9ddc6bbf312139217e5a777edf1ab4867e23e4c2af267`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 165–175.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : ReflectsMonomorphisms F := ReflectsMonomorphisms.mk <| by
  intro X Y f _
  have : IsIso (pullback.fst (F.map f) (F.map f)) :=
    isIso_fst_of_mono (F.map f)
  have : IsIso (F.map (pullback.fst f f)) := by
    rw [← PreservesPullback.iso_hom_fst]
    exact IsIso.comp_isIso
  have : IsIso (pullback.fst f f) := isIso_of_reflects_iso (pullback.fst _ _) F
  exact (pullback.diagonal_isKernelPair f).mono_of_isIso_fst

/-- Fiber functors are faithful. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant47e33aa5f7acccb9c0504f91b3cfb2d60ce142d5d691dd60ebe9aabd118b8eaf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant47e33aa5f7acccb9c0504f91b3cfb2d60ce142d5d691dd60ebe9aabd118b8eaf.lean#L165).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3e4801c7f4317cec460f1c725166a9ad8873714b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
