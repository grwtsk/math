## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:191d2301-b9b4-6b2d-7fed-e64567b264ad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 363–372.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isIso_of_mono_of_eq_card_fiber {X Y : C} (f : X ⟶ Y) [Mono f]
    (h : Nat.card (F.obj X) = Nat.card (F.obj Y)) : IsIso f := by
  have : IsIso (F.map f) := by
    apply (ConcreteCategory.isIso_iff_bijective (F.map f)).mpr
    apply (Fintype.bijective_iff_injective_and_card (F.map f)).mpr
    refine ⟨injective_of_mono_of_preservesPullback (F.map f), ?_⟩
    simp only [← Nat.card_eq_fintype_card, h]
  exact isIso_of_reflects_iso f F

/-- Along a mono that is not an iso, the cardinality of the fiber strictly increases. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant47e33aa5f7acccb9c0504f91b3cfb2d60ce142d5d691dd60ebe9aabd118b8eaf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant47e33aa5f7acccb9c0504f91b3cfb2d60ce142d5d691dd60ebe9aabd118b8eaf.lean#L363).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3e4801c7f4317cec460f1c725166a9ad8873714b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
