## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e70153ea72590e49112b00f6c5979395579e5098b446b6aff1c90f5a6b86df0c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1403–1410.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofCommaFstEquivalenceFunctor (c : C) :
    CostructuredArrow (Comma.fst F G) c ⥤ Comma (Over.forget c ⋙ F) G where
  obj X := ⟨Over.mk X.hom, X.left.right, X.left.hom⟩
  map f := ⟨Over.homMk f.left.left (by simpa using f.w), f.left.right, by simp⟩

set_option backward.defeqAttrib.useBackward true in
/-- The inverse functor used to define the equivalence `ofCommaFstEquivalence`. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant2d6f2ca46c8d0b7aff4388ff0d022526787bae27fcfde4773b9e4e31a2c791d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant2d6f2ca46c8d0b7aff4388ff0d022526787bae27fcfde4773b9e4e31a2c791d7.lean#L1403).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4824ac62ed60d335de8849c30f7b43ba7d83cb05` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
