## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:deb8d0d525610543adec949835119c40ab97bda5b86e559e3eb14bbd272e836e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 750–755.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def liftToInitialUnique {D : Type*} [Category D] {Z : D} (F : C ⥤ D) (hZ : Limits.IsInitial Z)
    (G : WithInitial C ⥤ D) (h : incl ⋙ G ≅ F) (hG : G.obj star ≅ Z) : G ≅ liftToInitial F hZ :=
  liftUnique F (fun _z => hZ.to _) (fun _x _y _f => hZ.hom_ext _ _) G h hG fun _x => hZ.hom_ext _ _

/-- Constructs a morphism from `star` to `of X`. -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantcb0cae3084d848b36913a7b0f03a678f6c83a71d62279bf79b7d07cd96cf12b1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantcb0cae3084d848b36913a7b0f03a678f6c83a71d62279bf79b7d07cd96cf12b1.lean#L750).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e4abb85b8f21c1bcceb1ec843c8aca4bb8a154ed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
