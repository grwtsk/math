## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2b745592c595eb52df41b94fb8cde03fa1a4c4edc590e24cce30c06f291c98bf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 486–498.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class IsCofilteredOrEmpty : Prop where
  /-- for every pair of objects there exists another object "to the left" -/
  cone_objs : ∀ X Y : C, ∃ (W : _) (_ : W ⟶ X) (_ : W ⟶ Y), True
  /-- for every pair of parallel morphisms there exists a morphism to the left
    so the compositions are equal -/
  cone_maps : ∀ ⦃X Y : C⦄ (f g : X ⟶ Y), ∃ (W : _) (h : W ⟶ X), h ≫ f = h ≫ g

/-- A category `IsCofiltered` if
1. for every pair of objects there exists another object "to the left",
2. for every pair of parallel morphisms there exists a morphism to the left so the compositions
   are equal, and
3. there exists some object. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantcbea5e7b87d27c682290b23a50e45504885273ff64eb2d82fc86276f74fbb374.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantcbea5e7b87d27c682290b23a50e45504885273ff64eb2d82fc86276f74fbb374.lean#L486).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d5df8ea4f281ca6c7e16266ce95933206ddb0a0b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
