## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b93a6d168535d7449a8299387a798948ba01cbe24c315e125b6cdeafb9601346`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 291–303.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) [HasProducts.{0} C] [AB4StarOfSize.{0} C] : CountableAB4Star C :=
  ⟨inferInstance⟩

attribute [instance] CountableAB4.ofShape CountableAB4Star.ofShape

/--
A category `C` which has filtered colimits of a given size is said to have `AB5` of that size
provided that these filtered colimits are exact.

`AB5OfSize.{w, w'} C` means that `C` has exact colimits of shape `J : Type w'` with
`Category.{w} J` such that `J` is filtered.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant798bc32a3eca8fd73f2b088310c64b3652fb4569ddd6ab31276590649f6a9d0d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant798bc32a3eca8fd73f2b088310c64b3652fb4569ddd6ab31276590649f6a9d0d.lean#L291).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `396f007c83383599ab8260ba35e87f79d5ddce34` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
