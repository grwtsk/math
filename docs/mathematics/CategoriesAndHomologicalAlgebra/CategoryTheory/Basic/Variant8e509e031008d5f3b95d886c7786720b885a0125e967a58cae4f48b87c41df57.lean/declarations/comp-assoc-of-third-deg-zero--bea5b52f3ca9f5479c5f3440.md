## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e3065343-e1e6-836f-c7ee-29e36dbc51f7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 136–148.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma comp_assoc_of_third_deg_zero
    {a₁ a₂ a₁₂ : ℕ} (α : Ext X Y a₁) (β : Ext Y Z a₂) (γ : Ext Z T 0)
    (h₁₂ : a₁ + a₂ = a₁₂) :
    (α.comp β h₁₂).comp γ (add_zero _) = α.comp (β.comp γ (add_zero _)) h₁₂ := by

section

variable [HasDerivedCategory.{w'} C]

/-- When an instance of `[HasDerivedCategory.{w'} C]` is available, this is the bijection
between `Ext.{w} X Y n` and a type of morphisms in the derived category. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant8e509e031008d5f3b95d886c7786720b885a0125e967a58cae4f48b87c41df57.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant8e509e031008d5f3b95d886c7786720b885a0125e967a58cae4f48b87c41df57.lean#L136).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3bcd760385c3e60e44e5cf94a40f56f6ee995a16` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
