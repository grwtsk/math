## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d34a64c93c4cb73e9ad5cb2ee15988f52a862a23dd877aabd4d712214d7978ab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 117–130.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : IsFiltered (Discrete PUnit) where
  cocone_objs X Y := ⟨⟨PUnit.unit⟩, ⟨⟨by trivial⟩⟩, ⟨⟨by subsingleton⟩⟩, trivial⟩
  cocone_maps X Y f g := ⟨⟨PUnit.unit⟩, ⟨⟨by trivial⟩⟩, by subsingleton⟩

namespace IsFiltered

section AllowEmpty

variable {C}
variable [IsFilteredOrEmpty C]

/-- `max j j'` is an arbitrary choice of object to the right of both `j` and `j'`,
whose existence is ensured by `IsFiltered`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant9dff71b8938ed1acc72764eaf9ad642b03b8d40c4d618e9351d68c6ff84a09bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant9dff71b8938ed1acc72764eaf9ad642b03b8d40c4d618e9351d68c6ff84a09bd.lean#L117).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c891fe6e95a4d22625d5806faf9b94a2c6d485fc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
