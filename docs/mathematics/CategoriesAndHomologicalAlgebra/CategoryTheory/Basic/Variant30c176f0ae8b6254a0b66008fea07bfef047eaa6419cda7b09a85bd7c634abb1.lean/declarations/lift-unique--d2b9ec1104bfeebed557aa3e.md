## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:be649bb2-17ea-30c5-66df-8a511e957749`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 163–184.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

      simp only [Category.comp_id, Category.id_comp] at ih ⊢
      -- Porting note: Had to do substitute `p.cons f'` and `f'.toPath` by their fully qualified
      -- versions in this `have` clause (elsewhere too).
      have : Φ.map (Quiver.Path.cons p f') = Φ.map p ≫ Φ.map (Quiver.Hom.toPath f') := by
        convert! Functor.map_comp Φ p (Quiver.Hom.toPath f')
      rw [this, ih]

/-- Two functors out of a path category are equal when they agree on singleton paths. -/
@[ext (iff := false)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant30c176f0ae8b6254a0b66008fea07bfef047eaa6419cda7b09a85bd7c634abb1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant30c176f0ae8b6254a0b66008fea07bfef047eaa6419cda7b09a85bd7c634abb1.lean#L163).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f06be9349e3ca960ac3af8536dc9d38c698cc1ed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
