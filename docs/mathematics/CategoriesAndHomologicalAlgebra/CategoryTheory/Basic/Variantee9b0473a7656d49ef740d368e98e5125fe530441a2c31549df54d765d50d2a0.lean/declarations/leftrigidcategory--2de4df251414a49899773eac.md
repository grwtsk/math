## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ad550dbea8a34a70f1548eae70a0897bb92771a6a2ef53077cd0e8983bdca0dd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 669–683.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class LeftRigidCategory (C : Type u) [Category.{v} C] [MonoidalCategory.{v} C] where
  [leftDual : ∀ X : C, HasLeftDual X]
#align category_theory.left_rigid_category CategoryTheory.LeftRigidCategory

attribute [instance 100] RightRigidCategory.rightDual
attribute [instance 100] LeftRigidCategory.leftDual

/-- Any left rigid category is monoidal closed, with the internal hom `X ⟶[C] Y = ᘁX ⊗ Y`.
This has to be a definition rather than an instance to avoid diamonds, for example between
`category_theory.monoidal_closed.functor_category` and
`category_theory.monoidal.left_rigid_functor_category`. Moreover, in concrete applications there is
often a more useful definition of the internal hom object than `ᘁY ⊗ X`, in which case the monoidal
closed structure shouldn't come the rigid structure (e.g. in the category `FinVect k`, it is more
convenient to define the internal hom as `Y →ₗ[k] X` rather than `ᘁY ⊗ X` even though these are
naturally isomorphic). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantee9b0473a7656d49ef740d368e98e5125fe530441a2c31549df54d765d50d2a0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantee9b0473a7656d49ef740d368e98e5125fe530441a2c31549df54d765d50d2a0.lean#L669).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ff16d3c8af4b12fe5d7d5d7c9600dec0816b6b5f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
