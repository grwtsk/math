## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a517dd5ea14e9365fc37036340ea2d7a8d241e631f76de8f195d8bec492852c1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 387–397.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class ReflectsColimitsOfShape (J : Type w) [Category.{w'} J] (F : C ⥤ D) where
  reflectsColimit : ∀ {K : J ⥤ C}, ReflectsColimit K F := by infer_instance
#align category_theory.limits.reflects_colimits_of_shape CategoryTheory.Limits.ReflectsColimitsOfShape

-- This should be used with explicit universe variables.
/-- A functor `F : C ⥤ D` reflects limits if
whenever the image of a cone over some `K : J ⥤ C` under `F` is a limit cone in `D`,
the cone was already a limit cone in `C`.
Note that we do not assume a priori that `D` actually has any limits.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant2055ead59efdffd3ab95d8d291aa724aa2a95c1b34997fd2ddf06edda5b149f3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant2055ead59efdffd3ab95d8d291aa724aa2a95c1b34997fd2ddf06edda5b149f3.lean#L387).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `579409d378a790398cf9a7ac566200b147e41132` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
