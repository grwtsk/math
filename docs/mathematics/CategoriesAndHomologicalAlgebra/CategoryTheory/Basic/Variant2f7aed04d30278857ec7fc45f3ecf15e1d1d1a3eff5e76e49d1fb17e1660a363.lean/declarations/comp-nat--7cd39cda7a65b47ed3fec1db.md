## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5d802c62-9e64-0b80-2bee-2caf1e39c3c8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 242–246.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma δ_comp_δ_nat {n} (i j : ℕ) (hi : i < n + 2) (hj : j < n + 2) (H : i ≤ j) :
    δ ⟨i, hi⟩ ≫ δ ⟨j + 1, by omega⟩ = δ ⟨j, hj⟩ ≫ δ ⟨i, by omega⟩ :=
  δ_comp_δ (n := n) (i := ⟨i, by omega⟩) (j := ⟨j, by omega⟩) (by simpa)

/-- A version of σ_comp_σ with indices in ℕ satisfying relevant inequalities. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant2f7aed04d30278857ec7fc45f3ecf15e1d1d1a3eff5e76e49d1fb17e1660a363.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant2f7aed04d30278857ec7fc45f3ecf15e1d1d1a3eff5e76e49d1fb17e1660a363.lean#L242).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5971d9463f4521ed115ecf26c0c83782a2f222ca` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
