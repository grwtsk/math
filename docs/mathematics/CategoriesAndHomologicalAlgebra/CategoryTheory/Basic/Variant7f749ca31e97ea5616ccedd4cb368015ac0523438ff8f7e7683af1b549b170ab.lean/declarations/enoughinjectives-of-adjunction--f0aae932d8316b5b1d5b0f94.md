## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:787de48d-0a37-c5c4-6097-6e8ceb473363`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 342–349.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma EnoughInjectives.of_adjunction {C : Type u₁} {D : Type u₂}
    [Category.{v₁} C] [Category.{v₂} D]
    {L : C ⥤ D} {R : D ⥤ C} (adj : L ⊣ R) [L.PreservesMonomorphisms] [L.ReflectsMonomorphisms]
    [EnoughInjectives D] : EnoughInjectives C where
  presentation _ :=
    ⟨adj.injectivePresentationOfMap _ (EnoughInjectives.presentation _).some⟩

/-- An equivalence of categories transfers enough injectives. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant7f749ca31e97ea5616ccedd4cb368015ac0523438ff8f7e7683af1b549b170ab.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant7f749ca31e97ea5616ccedd4cb368015ac0523438ff8f7e7683af1b549b170ab.lean#L342).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1d81704e0a62dc220f9d8008bf1559b9bdfecadc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
