## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a7335bb5-b09c-8017-e476-6158cb6fcd4c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 405–410.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma preservesLimitsOfShape_of_evaluation (F : D ⥤ K ⥤ C) (J : Type*) [Category* J]
    (_ : ∀ k : K, PreservesLimitsOfShape J (F ⋙ (evaluation K C).obj k)) :
    PreservesLimitsOfShape J F :=
  ⟨fun {G} => preservesLimit_of_evaluation F G fun _ => PreservesLimitsOfShape.preservesLimit⟩

/-- `F : D ⥤ K ⥤ C` preserves all limits if it does for each `k : K`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantedf81636b7c4d2408f657e6e0de97d38667ea4f726d2882428d3cce2a494c311.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantedf81636b7c4d2408f657e6e0de97d38667ea4f726d2882428d3cce2a494c311.lean#L405).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bb4590eee1af73a568c0cbd0267d395368058be6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
