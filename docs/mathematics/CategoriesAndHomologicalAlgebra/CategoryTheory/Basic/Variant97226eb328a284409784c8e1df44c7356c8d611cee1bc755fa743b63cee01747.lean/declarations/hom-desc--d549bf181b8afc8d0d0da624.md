## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:210710d2-7db2-0256-6f88-f77eeefd5a36`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 483–489.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hom_desc (h : IsUniversal f) {c : C} (η : f.right ⟶ c) :
    η = h.desc (mk <| f.hom ≫ T.map η) :=
  let g := mk <| f.hom ≫ T.map η
  congrArg CommaMorphism.right (h.hom_ext (homMk η rfl : f ⟶ g) (h.to g))

/-- Two morphisms out of a universal `T`-structured arrow are equal if their image under `T` are
equal after precomposing the universal arrow. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant97226eb328a284409784c8e1df44c7356c8d611cee1bc755fa743b63cee01747.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant97226eb328a284409784c8e1df44c7356c8d611cee1bc755fa743b63cee01747.lean#L483).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c7509b18de3b3c52965ea801c396fbe01d3d44b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
