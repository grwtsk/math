## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:46bd9bca-eb85-e2b1-56fe-979ca911618b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 287–295.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma comp_hom_ext_apex {c : C} {f g : c ⟶ (S₁ ≫ S₂).apex}
    (hₗ : f ≫ πₗ S₁ S₂ = g ≫ πₗ S₁ S₂)
    (hᵣ : f ≫ πᵣ S₁ S₂ = g ≫ πᵣ S₁ S₂) :
    f = g := by
  apply Limits.PullbackCone.IsLimit.hom_ext (isLimitCompPullbackCone S₁ S₂) <;> grind

/-- A restatement of the universal property of `(S₁ ≫ S₂).apex` as coming from a pullback.
This is the main intended way to produce morphisms towards the apex of a composition of spans. -/
@[no_expose]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant72f2076648b9fe745621c2f1e8af5070c09e47dc05628c3750b71e2d90433581.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant72f2076648b9fe745621c2f1e8af5070c09e47dc05628c3750b71e2d90433581.lean#L287).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7f1281ba61abfe74bb14bc3d3405967fa8926ebf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
