## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5c516531894277d1962532321ce0aa55fc67e366a33114cd39d90e54939d46e1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–107.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def trans {A B C : Type u₁}
    [Ring A] [Algebra R A] [Ring B] [Algebra R B] [Ring C] [Algebra R C]
    (e : MoritaEquivalence R A B) (e' : MoritaEquivalence R B C) :
    MoritaEquivalence R A C where
  eqv := e.eqv.trans e'.eqv
  linear := e.eqv.functor.instLinearComp e'.eqv.functor

variable {R} in
/--
Isomorphic `R`-algebras are Morita equivalent.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant20e744081bfc992aaef7e94865254bca627a22cba4822df8bc0a41ea3f5df22a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant20e744081bfc992aaef7e94865254bca627a22cba4822df8bc0a41ea3f5df22a.lean#L97).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a780af81b7546a11621c6ad861ccbb6f1a6cae1e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
