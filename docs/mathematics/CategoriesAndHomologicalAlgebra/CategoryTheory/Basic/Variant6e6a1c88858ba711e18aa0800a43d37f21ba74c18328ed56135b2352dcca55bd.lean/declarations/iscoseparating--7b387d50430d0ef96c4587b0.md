## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2c9f15d0ce6946ca6c9a8a2da365a6a1278898609c7b3d8f39d64b39d8856497`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 78–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IsCoseparating (𝒢 : Set C) : Prop :=
  ∀ ⦃X Y : C⦄ (f g : X ⟶ Y), (∀ G ∈ 𝒢, ∀ (h : Y ⟶ G), f ≫ h = g ≫ h) → f = g

/-- We say that `𝒢` is a detecting set if the functors `C(G, -)` collectively reflect isomorphisms,
    i.e., if any `h` with domain in `𝒢` uniquely factors through `f`, then `f` is an isomorphism. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant6e6a1c88858ba711e18aa0800a43d37f21ba74c18328ed56135b2352dcca55bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant6e6a1c88858ba711e18aa0800a43d37f21ba74c18328ed56135b2352dcca55bd.lean#L78).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e352185595d86cce5376f172b48654f94331ec35` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
