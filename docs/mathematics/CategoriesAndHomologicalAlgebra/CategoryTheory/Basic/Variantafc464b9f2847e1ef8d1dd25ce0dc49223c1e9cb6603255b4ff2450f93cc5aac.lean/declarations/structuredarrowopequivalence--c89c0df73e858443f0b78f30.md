## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c1be02bf1b49bfdb9ba2b892bfbf9147e5347896aeab436d10946a7671163b30`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1062–1080.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

def structuredArrowOpEquivalence (F : C ⥤ D) (d : D) :
    (StructuredArrow d F)ᵒᵖ ≌ CostructuredArrow F.op (op d) where
  functor := StructuredArrow.toCostructuredArrow F d
  inverse := (CostructuredArrow.toStructuredArrow' F d).rightOp
  unitIso := NatIso.ofComponents
    (fun X ↦ (StructuredArrow.isoMk (Iso.refl _)).op) (by
      rintro ⟨X⟩ ⟨Y⟩ f
      obtain ⟨X, x, rfl⟩ := X.mk_surjective
      obtain ⟨Y, y, rfl⟩ := Y.mk_surjective

  counitIso := NatIso.ofComponents
    (fun X => CostructuredArrow.isoMk (Iso.refl _))

/-- For a functor `F : C ⥤ D` and an object `d : D`, the category of costructured arrows
`F.obj c ⟶ d` is contravariantly equivalent to the category of structured arrows
`op d ⟶ F.op.obj c`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantafc464b9f2847e1ef8d1dd25ce0dc49223c1e9cb6603255b4ff2450f93cc5aac.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantafc464b9f2847e1ef8d1dd25ce0dc49223c1e9cb6603255b4ff2450f93cc5aac.lean#L1062).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7fc1155580bc5c4f4b54703d365f28c111a141f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
