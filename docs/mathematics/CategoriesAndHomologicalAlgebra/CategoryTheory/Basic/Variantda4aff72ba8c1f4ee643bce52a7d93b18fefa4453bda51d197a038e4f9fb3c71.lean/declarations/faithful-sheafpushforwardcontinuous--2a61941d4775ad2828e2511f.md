## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:627a1df713bb98e5029c3e3df8f288688a482c714dd00b303d837e8a0cacf7b3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 519–531.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance faithful_sheafPushforwardContinuous [G.IsContinuous J K] :
    Faithful (G.sheafPushforwardContinuous A J K) where
  map_injective := by
    intro ℱ ℱ' α β e
    ext1
    apply_fun fun e => e.hom at e
    dsimp [sheafPushforwardContinuous] at e
    rw [← sheafHom_eq G α.hom, ← sheafHom_eq G β.hom, e]

end IsCoverDense

/-- If `G : C ⥤ D` is cover dense and full, then the
map `(P ⟶ Q) → (G.op ⋙ P ⟶ G.op ⋙ Q)` is bijective when `Q` is a sheaf. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantda4aff72ba8c1f4ee643bce52a7d93b18fefa4453bda51d197a038e4f9fb3c71.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantda4aff72ba8c1f4ee643bce52a7d93b18fefa4453bda51d197a038e4f9fb3c71.lean#L519).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ced1ba6d6f0a95c7992a7d0489e0b2eac6d37151` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
