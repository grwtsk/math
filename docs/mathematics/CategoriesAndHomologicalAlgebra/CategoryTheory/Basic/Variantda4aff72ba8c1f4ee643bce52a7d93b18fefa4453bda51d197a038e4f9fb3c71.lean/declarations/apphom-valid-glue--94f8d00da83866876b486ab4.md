## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8e1e40ed-0741-e6a9-d9a6-590b0d0d8320`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 247–260.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem appHom_valid_glue {X : D} {Y : C} (f : op X ⟶ op (G.obj Y)) :
    appHom α X ≫ ℱ'.obj.map f = ℱ.map f ≫ α.app (op Y) := by
  ext
  apply appHom_restrict

  F ≟ F'
  j ≟ j' ⊢ (G.op ⋙ F).obj (op j) ≟ F'.obj (op (G'.obj j')) in

(Implementation). The maps given in `appIso` is inverse to each other and gives a `ℱ(X) ≅ ℱ'(X)`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantda4aff72ba8c1f4ee643bce52a7d93b18fefa4453bda51d197a038e4f9fb3c71.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantda4aff72ba8c1f4ee643bce52a7d93b18fefa4453bda51d197a038e4f9fb3c71.lean#L247).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ced1ba6d6f0a95c7992a7d0489e0b2eac6d37151` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
