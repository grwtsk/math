## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a7a2b1859a7b71ebbcf758cad31622a8a5f6674e8e548f09e52d803cccb677db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–106.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def structuredArrowDownwards (X₂ : C₂) :
    StructuredArrow X₂ T ⥤ StructuredArrow (R.obj X₂) B :=
  StructuredArrow.post X₂ T R ⋙ Comma.mapRight _ w ⋙
    StructuredArrow.pre (R.obj X₂) L B

section

variable {X₂ : C₂} {X₃ : C₃} (g : R.obj X₂ ⟶ B.obj X₃)

/- In [the paper by Kahn and Maltsiniotis, §4.3][KahnMaltsiniotis2008], given
`w : TwoSquare T L R B` and `g : R.obj X₂ ⟶ B.obj X₃`, a category `J` is introduced
and it is observed that it is equivalent to the two categories
`w.StructuredArrowRightwards g` and `w.CostructuredArrowDownwards g`. We shall show below
that there is an equivalence
`w.equivalenceJ g : w.StructuredArrowRightwards g ≌ w.CostructuredArrowDownwards g`. -/

/-- Given `w : TwoSquare T L R B` and a morphism `g : R.obj X₂ ⟶ B.obj X₃`, this is the
category `StructuredArrow (CostructuredArrow.mk g) (w.costructuredArrowRightwards X₃)`,
see the constructor `StructuredArrowRightwards.mk` for the data that is involved. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant09392534687d33c5263be5de3bd5bae6c2c9b9637c4aa281f33eff1cde1858e4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant09392534687d33c5263be5de3bd5bae6c2c9b9637c4aa281f33eff1cde1858e4.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `12da845dc388be8af57a56585ad58975691c08bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
