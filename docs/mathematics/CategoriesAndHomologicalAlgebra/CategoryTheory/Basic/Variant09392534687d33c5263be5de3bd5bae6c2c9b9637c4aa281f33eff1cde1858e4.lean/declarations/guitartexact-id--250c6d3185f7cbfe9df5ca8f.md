## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9248070f072fae9fa24855225d9b2cc26416c8671f074e2f3d0bd2da6249e52d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 314–330.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance guitartExact_id (F : C₁ ⥤ C₂) :
    GuitartExact (TwoSquare.mk (𝟭 C₁) F F (𝟭 C₂) (𝟙 F)) := by
  rw [guitartExact_iff_isConnected_rightwards]
  intro X₂ X₃ (g : F.obj X₂ ⟶ X₃)
  let Z := StructuredArrowRightwards (TwoSquare.mk (𝟭 C₁) F F (𝟭 C₂) (𝟙 F)) g
  let X₀ : Z := StructuredArrow.mk (Y := CostructuredArrow.mk g) (CostructuredArrow.homMk (𝟙 _))
  have φ : ∀ (X : Z), X₀ ⟶ X := fun X =>
    StructuredArrow.homMk (CostructuredArrow.homMk X.hom.left
      (by simpa using! CostructuredArrow.w X.hom))
  have : Nonempty Z := ⟨X₀⟩
  apply zigzag_isConnected
  intro X Y
  exact Zigzag.of_inv_hom (φ X) (φ Y)

end TwoSquare

end CategoryTheory
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant09392534687d33c5263be5de3bd5bae6c2c9b9637c4aa281f33eff1cde1858e4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant09392534687d33c5263be5de3bd5bae6c2c9b9637c4aa281f33eff1cde1858e4.lean#L314).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `12da845dc388be8af57a56585ad58975691c08bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
