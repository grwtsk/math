## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:064985c9-3b4c-3b4f-a2f4-7ea342be30c2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 135–144.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma StructuredArrowRightwards.mk_surjective
    (f : w.StructuredArrowRightwards g) :
    ∃ (X₁ : C₁) (a : X₂ ⟶ T.obj X₁) (b : L.obj X₁ ⟶ X₃)
      (comm : R.map a ≫ w.app X₁ ≫ B.map b = g), f = mk w g X₁ a b comm := by
  obtain ⟨g, φ, rfl⟩ := StructuredArrow.mk_surjective f
  obtain ⟨X₁, b, rfl⟩ := g.mk_surjective
  obtain ⟨a, ha, rfl⟩ := CostructuredArrow.homMk_surjective φ
  exact ⟨X₁, a, b, by simpa using ha, rfl⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant09392534687d33c5263be5de3bd5bae6c2c9b9637c4aa281f33eff1cde1858e4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant09392534687d33c5263be5de3bd5bae6c2c9b9637c4aa281f33eff1cde1858e4.lean#L135).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `12da845dc388be8af57a56585ad58975691c08bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
