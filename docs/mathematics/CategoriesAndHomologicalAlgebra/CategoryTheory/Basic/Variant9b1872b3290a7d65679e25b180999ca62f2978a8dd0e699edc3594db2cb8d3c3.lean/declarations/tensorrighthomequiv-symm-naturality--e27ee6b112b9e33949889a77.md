## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6220715f-0596-e334-483f-176505950646`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 405–415.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tensorRightHomEquiv_symm_naturality {X X' Y Y' Z : C} [ExactPairing Y Y'] (f : X ⟶ X')
    (g : X' ⟶ Z ⊗ Y') :
    (tensorRightHomEquiv X Y Y' Z).symm (f ≫ g) =
      (f ⊗ 𝟙 Y) ≫ (tensorRightHomEquiv X' Y Y' Z).symm g := by
  dsimp [tensorRightHomEquiv]

#align category_theory.tensor_right_hom_equiv_symm_naturality CategoryTheory.tensorRightHomEquiv_symm_naturality

/-- If `Y Y'` have an exact pairing,
then the functor `tensorLeft Y'` is left adjoint to `tensorLeft Y`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant9b1872b3290a7d65679e25b180999ca62f2978a8dd0e699edc3594db2cb8d3c3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant9b1872b3290a7d65679e25b180999ca62f2978a8dd0e699edc3594db2cb8d3c3.lean#L405).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9553cc6d6a583fc0c6933e17c2595f2c34c3f031` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
