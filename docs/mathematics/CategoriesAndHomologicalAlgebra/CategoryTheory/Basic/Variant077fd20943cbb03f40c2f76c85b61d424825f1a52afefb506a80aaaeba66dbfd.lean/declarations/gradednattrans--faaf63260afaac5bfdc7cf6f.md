## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8fb15c698839e3dfbfaa5ad2756cc231096f949c8252de5616ef3cce31cbc093`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 442–454.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure GradedNatTrans (A : Center V) (F G : EnrichedFunctor V C D) where
  /-- The `A`-graded transformation from `F` to `G` -/
  app : ∀ X : C, A.1 ⟶ F.obj X ⟶[V] G.obj X
  /-- `app` is a natural transformation. -/
  naturality :
    ∀ X Y : C,
      (A.2.β (X ⟶[V] Y)).hom ≫ (F.map X Y ⊗ₘ app Y) ≫ eComp V _ _ _ =
        (app X ⊗ₘ G.map X Y) ≫ eComp V _ _ _

attribute [reassoc] GradedNatTrans.naturality

/-- A natural transformation between two enriched functors is a `𝟙_ V`-graded natural
transformation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant077fd20943cbb03f40c2f76c85b61d424825f1a52afefb506a80aaaeba66dbfd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant077fd20943cbb03f40c2f76c85b61d424825f1a52afefb506a80aaaeba66dbfd.lean#L442).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b2426f0203ae2c149cbb557430e7f311f60ec97e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
