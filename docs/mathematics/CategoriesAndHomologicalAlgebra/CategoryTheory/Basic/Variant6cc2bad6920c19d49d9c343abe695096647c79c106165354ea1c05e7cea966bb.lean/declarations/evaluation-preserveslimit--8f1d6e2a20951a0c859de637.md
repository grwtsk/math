## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:602123e06d79e030d72ca890e26aedf997cabe5c7d6be684ee2de92d0e59ec95`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 209–215.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance evaluation_preservesLimit (F : J ⥤ K ⥤ C) [∀ k, HasLimit (F.flip.obj k)] (k : K) :
    PreservesLimit F ((evaluation K C).obj k) :=
  -- Porting note: added a let because X was not inferred
  let X : (k : K) → LimitCone (F.flip.obj k) := fun k => getLimitCone (F.flip.obj k)
  preservesLimit_of_preserves_limit_cone (combinedIsLimit _ X) <|
    IsLimit.ofIsoLimit (limit.isLimit _) (evaluateCombinedCones F X k).symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant6cc2bad6920c19d49d9c343abe695096647c79c106165354ea1c05e7cea966bb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant6cc2bad6920c19d49d9c343abe695096647c79c106165354ea1c05e7cea966bb.lean#L209).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d134bdd508e056b7bc19348117ca28a37c2bf94e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
