## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6238f54c9c108097770bcf38de94a69cd0e86e74362d6c5471d15be9058d226f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 157–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def inverse : w.CostructuredArrowDownwards g ⥤ w.StructuredArrowRightwards g where
  obj f := StructuredArrow.mk (Y := CostructuredArrow.mk f.hom.right)
      (CostructuredArrow.homMk f.left.hom (by simpa using StructuredArrow.w f.hom))
  map {f₁ f₂} φ :=
    StructuredArrow.homMk (CostructuredArrow.homMk φ.left.right
      (by dsimp; rw [← CostructuredArrow.w φ]; rfl))
      (by ext; exact StructuredArrow.w φ.left)
  map_id _ := rfl
  map_comp _ _ := rfl

end EquivalenceJ

/-- Given `w : TwoSquare T L R B` and a morphism `g : R.obj X₂ ⟶ B.obj X₃`, this is
the obvious equivalence of categories
`w.StructuredArrowRightwards g ≌ w.CostructuredArrowDownwards g`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant4ca914548bc76277dc5895626343beb909e3bc7b531d9e98c4654d6b98525ab9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant4ca914548bc76277dc5895626343beb909e3bc7b531d9e98c4654d6b98525ab9.lean#L157).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6fbd4398e5491e1d1e103b3c01fae7be0ca3c99b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
