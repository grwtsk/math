## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3597629b7137413036d813c82d5b67754bb4cfc026dad2c07e606bd1c5b7b3ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 196–208.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def edgeTransform :
    Prod.fst C D ⋙ inclLeft C D ⟶ Prod.snd C D ⋙ inclRight C D where
  app := fun (c, d) ↦ edge c d

end Inclusions

section Functoriality

variable {C D} {E : Type u₃} [Category.{v₃} E] {E' : Type u₄} [Category.{v₄} E']

/-- A pair of functor `F : C ⥤ E, G : D ⥤ E` as well as a natural transformation
`α : (Prod.fst C D) ⋙ F ⟶ (Prod.snd C D) ⋙ G`. defines a functor out of `C ⋆ D`.
This is the main entry point to define functors out of a join of categories. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantc9933c4416dde10549f83a36503d3327d0f64dfb06a66c4f7e881d22fa0f6304.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantc9933c4416dde10549f83a36503d3327d0f64dfb06a66c4f7e881d22fa0f6304.lean#L196).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2360df444fb04aab40089408de6a0f466fa24718` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
