## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:82ecea1c48d81f9fd53282fc396e8ee110e02383be3f04a2ade2a00f1577c633`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 220–230.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def restrictedYonedaObjMap₁ {F G : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ Type v} {η : F ⟶ A} {μ : G ⟶ A} (ε : F ⟶ G)
    (hε : ε ≫ μ = η) : restrictedYonedaObj η ⟶ restrictedYonedaObj μ where
  app _ := ↾fun u ↦ u.map₁ ε hε

/--
This is basically just `yoneda : Over A ⥤ (Over A)ᵒᵖ ⥤ Type (max u v)` restricted in the second
argument along the forgetful functor `CostructuredArrow yoneda A ⥤ Over A`, but done in a way
that we land in a smaller universe.

This is one direction of the equivalence we're constructing. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantd8b6e4425f909fce16ba41ff90f98c4f27b5278a9804cb4f1382f09791017086.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantd8b6e4425f909fce16ba41ff90f98c4f27b5278a9804cb4f1382f09791017086.lean#L220).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b04f102475ba09ce091cebfc8dedcf15cf3b2df1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
