## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2a9f7989492a3bb05a021e645067372a4adc2ef52efdc3efb667040ec5184c89`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 103–128.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[tactic sorryIfSorry, inherit_doc sorryIfSorry] def evalSorryIfSorry : Tactic := fun _ => do
  let goalType ← getMainTarget
  if goalType.hasSorry then
    closeMainGoal `sorry_if_sorry (← mkSorry goalType true)
  else
    throwError "The goal does not contain `sorry`"

/--
`rfl_cat` is a macro for `intros; rfl` which is attempted in `aesop_cat` before
doing the more expensive `aesop` tactic.

This gives a speedup because `simp` (called by `aesop`) is too slow.
There is a fix for this slowness in https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7428.
So, when that is resolved, the performance impact of `rfl_cat` should be measured again.

Implementation notes:
* `refine id ?_`:
  In some cases it is important that the type of the proof matches the expected type exactly.
  e.g. if the goal is `2 = 1 + 1`, the `rfl` tactic will give a proof of type `2 = 2`.
  Starting a proof with `refine id ?_` is a trick to make sure that the proof has exactly
  the expected type, in this case `2 = 1 + 1`. See also https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/270676-lean4/topic/changing.20a.20proof.20can.20break.20a.20later.20proof
* `apply_rfl`:
  `rfl` is a macro that attempts both `eq_refl` and `apply_rfl`. Since `apply_rfl`
  subsumes `eq_refl`, we can use `apply_rfl` instead. This fails twice as fast as `rfl`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantce1448bfbaf7863a59c21eb885b3e569eb9b25f81fc877e3ca7eaada546b3cc0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantce1448bfbaf7863a59c21eb885b3e569eb9b25f81fc877e3ca7eaada546b3cc0.lean#L103).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac969b751ae7fb83b7559981edb89db164269115` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
