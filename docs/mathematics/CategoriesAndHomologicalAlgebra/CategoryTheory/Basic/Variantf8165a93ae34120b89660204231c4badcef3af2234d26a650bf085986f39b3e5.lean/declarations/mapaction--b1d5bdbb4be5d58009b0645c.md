## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4d0a79019d0ea16fe7732320d5b8cb0932971069f309d617376d9b156f318c65`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 393–411.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mapAction (F : V ⥤ W) (G : Type*) [Monoid G] : Action V G ⥤ Action W G where
  obj M :=
    { V := F.obj M.V
      ρ :=
        { toFun := fun g => F.map (M.ρ g)
          map_one' := by simp
          map_mul' := fun g h => by
            dsimp
            rw [map_mul, End.mul_def, F.map_comp] } }
  map f :=
    { hom := F.map f.hom
      comm := fun g => by dsimp; rw [← F.map_comp, f.comm, F.map_comp] }
  map_id M := by ext; simp only [Action.id_hom, F.map_id]
  map_comp f g := by ext; simp only [Action.comp_hom, F.map_comp]

variable (G : Type*) [Monoid G]

/-- `Functor.mapAction` is functorial in the functor. -/
@[simps! hom inv]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantf8165a93ae34120b89660204231c4badcef3af2234d26a650bf085986f39b3e5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantf8165a93ae34120b89660204231c4badcef3af2234d26a650bf085986f39b3e5.lean#L393).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5c9d08bbce3770c1fa4bd2911cabbb6bf81ffde7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
