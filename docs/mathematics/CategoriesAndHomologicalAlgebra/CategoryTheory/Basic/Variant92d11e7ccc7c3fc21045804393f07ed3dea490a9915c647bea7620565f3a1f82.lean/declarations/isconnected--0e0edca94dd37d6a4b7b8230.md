## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b8faca3be61c6e5f0897c844e94136ae97c42ef754215aa70c78dc0fe3f840c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class IsConnected {C : Type u₁} [Category.{u₂, u₁} C] (X : C) : Prop where
  /-- `X` is not an initial object. -/
  notInitial : IsInitial X → False
  /-- `X` has no non-trivial subobjects. -/
  noTrivialComponent (Y : C) (i : Y ⟶ X) [Mono i] : (IsInitial Y → False) → IsIso i

/-- A functor is said to preserve connectedness if whenever `X : C` is connected,
also `F.obj X` is connected. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant92d11e7ccc7c3fc21045804393f07ed3dea490a9915c647bea7620565f3a1f82.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant92d11e7ccc7c3fc21045804393f07ed3dea490a9915c647bea7620565f3a1f82.lean#L97).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b22783391f6497c23885f75ab00c582d6ca0d898` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
