## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4903c33fb8f1991565b668ac9fa06af620ca9a1980fbca273890b577e4aaa40e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 168–176.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class HasForget₂ (C : Type u) (D : Type u') [Category.{v} C] [HasForget.{w} C]
  [Category.{v'} D] [HasForget.{w} D] where
  /-- A functor from `C` to `D` -/
  forget₂ : C ⥤ D
  /-- It covers the `HasForget.forget` for `C` and `D` -/
  forget_comp : forget₂ ⋙ forget D = forget C := by aesop

/-- The forgetful functor `C ⥤ D` between concrete categories for which we have an instance
`HasForget₂ C`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantdfed0b72d5827ae85a4eda24fba72441576b8be0debd7527eca27e28253e5e26.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantdfed0b72d5827ae85a4eda24fba72441576b8be0debd7527eca27e28253e5e26.lean#L168).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d3ed98208fef14caf83f199a211498248f395208` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
