## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6869e836-c648-6adc-58eb-6009d2114454`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 158–164.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma EffectiveEpiFamily.fac {B W : C} {α : Type*} (X : α → C) (π : (a : α) → (X a ⟶ B))
    [EffectiveEpiFamily X π] (e : (a : α) → (X a ⟶ W))
    (h : ∀ {Z : C} (a₁ a₂ : α) (g₁ : Z ⟶ X a₁) (g₂ : Z ⟶ X a₂),
      g₁ ≫ π _ = g₂ ≫ π _ → g₁ ≫ e _ = g₂ ≫ e _) (a : α) :
    π a ≫ EffectiveEpiFamily.desc X π e h = e a :=
  (EffectiveEpiFamily.getStruct X π).fac e h a

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant031da85c5a1d535985301c36798ea1244ac6159ac8ac742a962a7bfbe10fcc7f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant031da85c5a1d535985301c36798ea1244ac6159ac8ac742a962a7bfbe10fcc7f.lean#L158).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5e6451ec0604cb71ff2a6de8cfa377a357bb852e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
