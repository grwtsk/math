## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c7652ee74573cb265e7022a75134341f3ef4790ecf79e9e71321b70ebbc42196`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def preadditiveYoneda : C ⥤ Cᵒᵖ ⥤ AddCommGrp.{v} where
  obj Y := preadditiveYonedaObj Y ⋙ forget₂ _ _
  map f :=
    { app := fun _ => AddCommGrp.ofHom
        { toFun := fun g => g ≫ f
          map_zero' := Limits.zero_comp
          map_add' := fun _ _ => add_comp _ _ _ _ _ _ }
      naturality := fun _ _ _ => AddCommGrp.ext fun _ => Category.assoc _ _ _ }

/-- The Yoneda embedding for preadditive categories sends an object `X` to the copresheaf sending an
object `Y` to the `End X`-module of morphisms `X ⟶ Y`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant4ad90b6488e9de20a788895ea1c2505c60f61b0b13399a1b2f0326c7fbc48421.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant4ad90b6488e9de20a788895ea1c2505c60f61b0b13399a1b2f0326c7fbc48421.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `64520a8896c12d7b24256eb65906f77cfc19cf3b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
