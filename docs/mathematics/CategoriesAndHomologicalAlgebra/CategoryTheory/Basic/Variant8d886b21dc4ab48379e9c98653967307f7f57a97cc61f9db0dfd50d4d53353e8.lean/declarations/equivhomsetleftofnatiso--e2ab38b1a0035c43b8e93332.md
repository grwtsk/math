## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:12c82f53e32c91fbb4b14242d95b9d4ca6eeb090c33c81a358f1bb756e0ef9bf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 485–494.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def equivHomsetLeftOfNatIso {F F' : C ⥤ D} (iso : F ≅ F') {X : C} {Y : D} :
    (F.obj X ⟶ Y) ≃ (F'.obj X ⟶ Y) where
  toFun f := iso.inv.app _ ≫ f
  invFun g := iso.hom.app _ ≫ g
  left_inv f := by simp
  right_inv g := by simp

/-- Transport an adjunction along a natural isomorphism on the left. -/
@[to_dual (attr := simps)
/-- Transport an adjunction along a natural isomorphism on the right. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant8d886b21dc4ab48379e9c98653967307f7f57a97cc61f9db0dfd50d4d53353e8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant8d886b21dc4ab48379e9c98653967307f7f57a97cc61f9db0dfd50d4d53353e8.lean#L485).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93208999961658fe1e079a952aa1dd94a9ea74ce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
