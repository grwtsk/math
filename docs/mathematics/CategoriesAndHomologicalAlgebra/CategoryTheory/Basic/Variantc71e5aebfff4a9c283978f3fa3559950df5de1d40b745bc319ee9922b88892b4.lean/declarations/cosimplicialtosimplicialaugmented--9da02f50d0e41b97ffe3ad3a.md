## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:991b4bb16abb7784f816c5e854dac9d62abe0286f6a9616f8fb50d29ce3b05d4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 942–958.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def cosimplicialToSimplicialAugmented :
    CosimplicialObject.Augmented Cᵒᵖ ⥤ (SimplicialObject.Augmented C)ᵒᵖ where
  obj X := Opposite.op X.leftOp
  map f :=
    Quiver.Hom.op <|
      { left := NatTrans.leftOp f.right
        right := f.left.unop
        w := by
          ext x
          dsimp
          simp_rw [← unop_comp]
          congr 1
          exact (congr_app f.w (unop x)).symm }

objects and augmented cosimplicial objects in the opposite category. -/
@[simps! functor inverse]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantc71e5aebfff4a9c283978f3fa3559950df5de1d40b745bc319ee9922b88892b4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantc71e5aebfff4a9c283978f3fa3559950df5de1d40b745bc319ee9922b88892b4.lean#L942).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4d35798af9d30ee38b7aeb744c4d265793e5bacd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
