## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:45932a2379c4248316d74ef13599e61a86641698a9a0baabc61b3d6b1b8af273`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 154–167.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def functor : w.StructuredArrowRightwards g ⥤ w.CostructuredArrowDownwards g where
  obj f := CostructuredArrow.mk (Y := StructuredArrow.mk f.hom.left)
      (StructuredArrow.homMk f.right.hom (by simpa using CostructuredArrow.w f.hom))
  map {f₁ f₂} φ :=
    CostructuredArrow.homMk (StructuredArrow.homMk φ.right.left
      (by dsimp; rw [← StructuredArrow.w φ]; rfl))
      (by ext; exact CostructuredArrow.w φ.right)
  map_id _ := rfl
  map_comp _ _ := rfl

the obvious functor `w.CostructuredArrowDownwards g ⥤ w.StructuredArrowRightwards g`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantfd2775bfd90a0b3d560b1d2a069e839d6d74a23301d7c71f602b5fa587ab8298.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantfd2775bfd90a0b3d560b1d2a069e839d6d74a23301d7c71f602b5fa587ab8298.lean#L154).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6dc0f0865bd32ee734335d175724970f08049a43` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
