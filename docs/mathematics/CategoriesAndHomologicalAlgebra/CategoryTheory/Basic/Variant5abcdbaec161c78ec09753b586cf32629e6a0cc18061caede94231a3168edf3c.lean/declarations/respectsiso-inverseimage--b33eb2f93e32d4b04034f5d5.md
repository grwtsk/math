## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:12c66d27e202f91a2c678b6fc57286c8b62c2dc82384cd8e6be6db14f83a9308`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 369–375.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance RespectsIso.inverseImage (P : MorphismProperty D) [RespectsIso P] (F : C ⥤ D) :
    RespectsIso (P.inverseImage F) where
  precomp {X Y Z} e (he : IsIso e) f hf := by
    simpa [MorphismProperty.inverseImage, cancel_left_of_respectsIso] using hf
  postcomp {X Y Z} e (he : IsIso e) f hf := by
    simpa [MorphismProperty.inverseImage, cancel_right_of_respectsIso] using hf

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant5abcdbaec161c78ec09753b586cf32629e6a0cc18061caede94231a3168edf3c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant5abcdbaec161c78ec09753b586cf32629e6a0cc18061caede94231a3168edf3c.lean#L369).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e49349dfd8c9b6020a6d39057af1edeba2165a8b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
