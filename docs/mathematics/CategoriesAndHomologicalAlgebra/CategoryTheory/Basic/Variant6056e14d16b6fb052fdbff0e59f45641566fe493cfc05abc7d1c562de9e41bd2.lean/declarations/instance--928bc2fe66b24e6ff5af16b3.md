## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a71ac8f7ff29aa16313a2a25f2ea89e64c43ba7b02fd8af49e8d1a1bde6644df`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 208–216.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) preadditiveHasZeroMorphisms : HasZeroMorphisms C where
  Zero := inferInstance
  comp_zero f R := show leftComp R f 0 = 0 from map_zero _
  zero_comp P _ _ f := show rightComp P f 0 = 0 from map_zero _
#align category_theory.preadditive.preadditive_has_zero_morphisms CategoryTheory.Preadditive.preadditiveHasZeroMorphisms

/--Porting note: adding this before the ring instance allowed moduleEndRight to find
the correct Monoid structure on End. Moved both down after preadditiveHasZeroMorphisms
to make use of them -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant6056e14d16b6fb052fdbff0e59f45641566fe493cfc05abc7d1c562de9e41bd2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant6056e14d16b6fb052fdbff0e59f45641566fe493cfc05abc7d1c562de9e41bd2.lean#L208).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fe81433c80bf1f31ea63063c485e9ff84ccc76ba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
