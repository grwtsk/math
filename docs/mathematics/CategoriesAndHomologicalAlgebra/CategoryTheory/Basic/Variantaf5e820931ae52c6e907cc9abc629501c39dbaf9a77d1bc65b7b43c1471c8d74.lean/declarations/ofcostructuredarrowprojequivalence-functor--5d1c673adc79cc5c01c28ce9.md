## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:02e28697d32cc2266f1b5cd6022a746897e59f530287e0cb25c513b16543041c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 988–996.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofCostructuredArrowProjEquivalence.functor (F : T ⥤ D) (Y : D) (X : T) :
    CostructuredArrow (CostructuredArrow.proj F Y) X ⥤ CostructuredArrow (Over.forget X ⋙ F) Y :=
  Functor.toCostructuredArrow
    (Functor.toOver (CostructuredArrow.proj _ X ⋙ CostructuredArrow.proj F Y) _
      (fun g => by exact g.hom) (fun m => by have := m.w; aesop_cat)) _ _
    (fun f => f.left.hom) (by simp)

/-- The inverse functor of `ofCostructuredArrowProjEquivalence.functor`. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantaf5e820931ae52c6e907cc9abc629501c39dbaf9a77d1bc65b7b43c1471c8d74.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantaf5e820931ae52c6e907cc9abc629501c39dbaf9a77d1bc65b7b43c1471c8d74.lean#L988).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ef93c70240e040ad282cc913a68c97c98ca173d7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
