## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dd30ecedb5341e4cd2f4ba4fb3946c5b63e40bcf3b021937a786ebc1fd1ad128`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 63–100.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class Preadditive where
  homGroup : ∀ P Q : C, AddCommGroup (P ⟶ Q) := by infer_instance
  add_comp : ∀ (P Q R : C) (f f' : P ⟶ Q) (g : Q ⟶ R), (f + f') ≫ g = f ≫ g + f' ≫ g := by
    cat_disch
  comp_add : ∀ (P Q R : C) (f : P ⟶ Q) (g g' : Q ⟶ R), f ≫ (g + g') = f ≫ g + f ≫ g' := by

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantccf85cbe510b49847fad3bbb18ad05f82df29ab01340e21c928dfc096ef9cb39.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantccf85cbe510b49847fad3bbb18ad05f82df29ab01340e21c928dfc096ef9cb39.lean#L63).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9f12ba6cd9bf1203f922639fac8ade7a3407e431` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
