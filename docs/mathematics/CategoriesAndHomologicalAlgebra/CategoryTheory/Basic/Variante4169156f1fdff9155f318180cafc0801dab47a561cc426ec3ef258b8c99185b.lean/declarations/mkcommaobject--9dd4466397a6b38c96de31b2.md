## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a04b90e4d1b13515ebc93ccb6ce77faa139d2df3144da8186faa0d0f6e75b711`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 378–390.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkCommaObject (F : WithTerminal C ⥤ D) : Comma (𝟭 (C ⥤ D)) (Functor.const C) where
  right := F.obj .star
  left := (incl ⋙ F)
  hom :=
    { app x := F.map (starTerminal.from (.of x))
      naturality x y f := by
        dsimp
        rw [Category.comp_id, ← F.map_comp]
        congr 1}

/-- A morphism of functors `WithTerminal C ⥤ D` gives a morphism between the associated comma
objects. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variante4169156f1fdff9155f318180cafc0801dab47a561cc426ec3ef258b8c99185b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variante4169156f1fdff9155f318180cafc0801dab47a561cc426ec3ef258b8c99185b.lean#L378).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `279a2b686f7f16d1e52201927fc8b895e41b60d2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
