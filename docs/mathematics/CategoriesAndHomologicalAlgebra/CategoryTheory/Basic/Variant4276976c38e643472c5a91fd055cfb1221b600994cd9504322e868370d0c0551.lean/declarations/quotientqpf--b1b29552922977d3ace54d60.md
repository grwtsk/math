## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0f71abfb5e684c3bd448c228fa6fa4b37c150812f7e50fc163d2bd375ddc34fc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 518–538.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def quotientQPF (FG_abs_repr : ∀ {α} (x : G α), FG_abs (FG_repr x) = x)
    (FG_abs_map : ∀ {α β} (f : α → β) (x : F α), FG_abs (f <$> x) = f <$> FG_abs x) : QPF G where
  P := q.P
  abs {_} p := FG_abs (abs p)
  repr {_} x := repr (FG_repr x)
  abs_repr {α} x := by rw [abs_repr, FG_abs_repr]
  abs_map {α β} f x := by rw [abs_map, FG_abs_map]

end QPF

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant4276976c38e643472c5a91fd055cfb1221b600994cd9504322e868370d0c0551.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant4276976c38e643472c5a91fd055cfb1221b600994cd9504322e868370d0c0551.lean#L518).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9f820dbadfdc2c9c6e78b829d9a6f870b52e3e51` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
