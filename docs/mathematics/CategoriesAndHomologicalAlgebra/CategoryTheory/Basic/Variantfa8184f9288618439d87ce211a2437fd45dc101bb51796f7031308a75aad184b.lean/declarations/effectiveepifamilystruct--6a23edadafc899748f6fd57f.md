## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0f66463d2d97ab835b3110c54fb36b9afdeef4904300675d5a4bbaa44233d4fb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 105–130.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure EffectiveEpiFamilyStruct {B : C} {α : Type*}
    (X : α → C) (π : (a : α) → (X a ⟶ B)) where
  /--
  For every `W` with a family of morphisms `e a : Y a ⟶ W` that coequalizes every pair of morphisms
  `g₁ : Z ⟶ Y a₁`, `g₂ : Z ⟶ Y a₂` which the family `π` coequalizes, `desc e h` is a morphism
  `X ⟶ W`...
  -/
  desc : ∀ {W} (e : (a : α) → (X a ⟶ W)),
          (∀ {Z : C} (a₁ a₂ : α) (g₁ : Z ⟶ X a₁) (g₂ : Z ⟶ X a₂),
      g₁ ≫ π _ = g₂ ≫ π _ → g₁ ≫ e _ = g₂ ≫ e _) → (B ⟶ W)
  /-- ...factorizing the components of `e` through the components of `π`... -/
  fac : ∀ {W} (e : (a : α) → (X a ⟶ W))
          (h : ∀ {Z : C} (a₁ a₂ : α) (g₁ : Z ⟶ X a₁) (g₂ : Z ⟶ X a₂),
            g₁ ≫ π _ = g₂ ≫ π _ → g₁ ≫ e _ = g₂ ≫ e _)
          (a : α), π a ≫ desc e h = e a
  /-- ...and as such, unique. -/
  uniq : ∀ {W} (e : (a : α) → (X a ⟶ W))
          (h : ∀ {Z : C} (a₁ a₂ : α) (g₁ : Z ⟶ X a₁) (g₂ : Z ⟶ X a₂),
            g₁ ≫ π _ = g₂ ≫ π _ → g₁ ≫ e _ = g₂ ≫ e _)
          (m : B ⟶ W), (∀ (a : α), π a ≫ m = e a) → m = desc e h

/--
A family of morphisms `π a : X a ⟶ B` indexed by `α` is effective epimorphic
provided that the `π a` exhibit `B` as a colimit of the diagram of all "relations"
`R → X a₁`, `R ⟶ X a₂` for all `a₁ a₂ : α`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantfa8184f9288618439d87ce211a2437fd45dc101bb51796f7031308a75aad184b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantfa8184f9288618439d87ce211a2437fd45dc101bb51796f7031308a75aad184b.lean#L105).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `926d6cb6a6e7a1ce49ce843e93f1316420ce5fe1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
