## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c713331ac797795a027e42e3eb3b89107144f582dfc30438a05e289ed1a2b19b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 386–401.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [Quiver.IsThin C] (f : X ⟶ Y) : Epi f where
  left_cancellation _ _ _ := Subsingleton.elim _ _

end

section

variable (C : Type u)
variable [Category.{v} C]

universe u'

/-- The category structure on `ULift C` that is induced from the category
structure on `C`. This is not made a global instance because of a diamond
when `C` is a preordered type. -/
@[instance_reducible]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantdf2ca854387ea16a1defdf7bc051eafbb1bf180c84a1a52e8525376288af0bce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantdf2ca854387ea16a1defdf7bc051eafbb1bf180c84a1a52e8525376288af0bce.lean#L386).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `91810bb25a94b84f40772a93c5ee7adc3be73d42` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
