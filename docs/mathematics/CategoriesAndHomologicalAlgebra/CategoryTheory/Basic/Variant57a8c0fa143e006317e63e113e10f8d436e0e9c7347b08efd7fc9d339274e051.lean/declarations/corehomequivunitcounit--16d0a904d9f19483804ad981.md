## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:234d03dae7716cd7c0fb56eb59ee7ef6104c08bf69971b74c98f2e1b3fc8825e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 310–325.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure CoreHomEquivUnitCounit (F : C ⥤ D) (G : D ⥤ C) where
  /-- The equivalence between `Hom (F X) Y` and `Hom X (G Y)` coming from an adjunction -/
  homEquiv : ∀ X Y, (F.obj X ⟶ Y) ≃ (X ⟶ G.obj Y)
  /-- The unit of an adjunction -/
  unit : 𝟭 C ⟶ F ⋙ G
  /-- The counit of an adjunction -/
  counit : G ⋙ F ⟶ 𝟭 D
  /-- The relationship between the unit and hom set equivalence of an adjunction -/
  homEquiv_unit : ∀ {X Y f}, (homEquiv X Y) f = unit.app X ≫ G.map f := by aesop_cat
  /-- The relationship between the counit and hom set equivalence of an adjunction -/
  homEquiv_counit : ∀ {X Y g}, (homEquiv X Y).symm g = F.map g ≫ counit.app Y := by aesop_cat

/-- This is an auxiliary data structure useful for constructing adjunctions.
See `Adjunction.mkOfHomEquiv`.
This structure won't typically be used anywhere else.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant57a8c0fa143e006317e63e113e10f8d436e0e9c7347b08efd7fc9d339274e051.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant57a8c0fa143e006317e63e113e10f8d436e0e9c7347b08efd7fc9d339274e051.lean#L310).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5b3f3722f61de6ccdddab966badc9b281b61639d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
