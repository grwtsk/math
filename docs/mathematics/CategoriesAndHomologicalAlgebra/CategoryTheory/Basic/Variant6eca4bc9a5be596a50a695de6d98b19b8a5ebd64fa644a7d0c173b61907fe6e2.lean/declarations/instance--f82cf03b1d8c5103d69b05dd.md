## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5a1e0836ee7f88fd0a504bdfa1c147cbd8f1fecd84a02df53b4ef249a9234d8d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 265–275.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : (comonadToFunctor C).ReflectsIsomorphisms where
  reflects f _ := (ComonadIso.mk (asIso ((comonadToFunctor C).map f)) f.app_ε f.app_δ).isIso_hom

variable {C}

/-- An isomorphism of monads gives a natural isomorphism of the underlying functors.

/- Porting note: removed
`@[simps (config := { rhsMd := semireducible })]`
and replaced with `@[simps]` in the two declarations below -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant6eca4bc9a5be596a50a695de6d98b19b8a5ebd64fa644a7d0c173b61907fe6e2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant6eca4bc9a5be596a50a695de6d98b19b8a5ebd64fa644a7d0c173b61907fe6e2.lean#L265).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `10f817b9b001ded7440ead377dbfd2d8dee19bfc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
