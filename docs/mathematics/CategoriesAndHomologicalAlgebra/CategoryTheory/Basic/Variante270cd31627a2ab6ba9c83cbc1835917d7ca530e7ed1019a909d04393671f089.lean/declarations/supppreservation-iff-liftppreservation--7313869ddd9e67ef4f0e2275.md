## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ddcfd54c-2c05-453d-e1d6-b36897b67418`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 256–269.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem suppPreservation_iff_liftpPreservation : q.SuppPreservation ↔ q.LiftPPreservation := by
  constructor <;> intro h
  · rintro α p ⟨a, f⟩
    have h' := h
    rw [suppPreservation_iff_isUniform] at h'
    dsimp only [SuppPreservation, supp] at h
    simp only [liftP_iff_of_isUniform, supp_eq_of_isUniform, MvPFunctor.liftP_iff', h',
      image_univ, mem_range, exists_imp]
    constructor <;> intros <;> subst_vars <;> solve_by_elim
  · rintro α ⟨a, f⟩
    simp only [LiftPPreservation] at h
    ext
    simp only [supp, h, mem_setOf_eq]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variante270cd31627a2ab6ba9c83cbc1835917d7ca530e7ed1019a909d04393671f089.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variante270cd31627a2ab6ba9c83cbc1835917d7ca530e7ed1019a909d04393671f089.lean#L256).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c7074f6390e56371bc5c090e91c3f027aa874651` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
