## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4ea57fd367a85976914d2dcc7638bdadf90c88c49416e010008c1f0c1245c900`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 233–250.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def effectiveEpiFamilyStructOfIsIsoDesc {B : C} {α : Type*} (X : α → C)
    (π : (a : α) → (X a ⟶ B)) [HasCoproduct X] [IsIso (Sigma.desc π)] :
    EffectiveEpiFamilyStruct X π where
  desc e _ := (asIso (Sigma.desc π)).inv ≫ (Sigma.desc e)
  fac e h := by
    intro a
    have : π a = Sigma.ι X a ≫ (asIso (Sigma.desc π)).hom := by simp only [asIso_hom,
      colimit.ι_desc, Cofan.mk_ι_app]
    rw [this, assoc]
    simp only [asIso_hom, asIso_inv, IsIso.hom_inv_id_assoc, colimit.ι_desc,
      Cofan.mk_ι_app]
  uniq e h m hm := by
    simp only [asIso_inv, IsIso.eq_inv_comp]
    ext a
    simp only [colimit.ι_desc_assoc, Discrete.functor_obj, Cofan.mk_ι_app,
      colimit.ι_desc]
    exact hm a

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant18bc5cbdbc4fa5dc049698b141801767b354c2dcc1c513b8f9b621b6f93b8404.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant18bc5cbdbc4fa5dc049698b141801767b354c2dcc1c513b8f9b621b6f93b8404.lean#L233).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c4fea83a5f672bde7f9afb7123724f3aa8ff13ce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
