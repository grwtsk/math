## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:121a05c5ae0d6aef25615db223813140c52a7cb97c0c476b59cf42bba6916105`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 657–667.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isEquivalence_post (S : C) (F : B ⥤ C) (G : C ⥤ D) [G.Full] [G.Faithful] :
    (post F G S).IsEquivalence where

section

variable {U : A ⥤ B} {V : B} {F : C ⥤ A} {G : D ⥤ B}
  (α : F ⋙ U ⟶ S ⋙ G) (β : G.obj T ⟶ V)

/-- The functor `CostructuredArrow S T ⥤ CostructuredArrow U V` that is deduced from
a natural transformation `F ⋙ U ⟶ S ⋙ G` and a morphism `G.obj T ⟶ V` -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant975bf66c84df142022eb43b0491f1905397330c0bbd9a95d3971be213c193ba8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant975bf66c84df142022eb43b0491f1905397330c0bbd9a95d3971be213c193ba8.lean#L657).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5208a59c866c9f65c650962f528308c79c997d81` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
