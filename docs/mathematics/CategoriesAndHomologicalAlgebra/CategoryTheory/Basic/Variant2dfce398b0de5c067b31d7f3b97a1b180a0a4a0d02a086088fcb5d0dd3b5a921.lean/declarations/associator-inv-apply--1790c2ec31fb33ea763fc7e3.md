## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:badb4e6a-4b3f-1edc-e002-1994fa4bd1d6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 75–83.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    ((α_ X Y Z).inv : X ⊗ Y ⊗ Z → (X ⊗ Y) ⊗ Z) (x, (y, z)) = ((x, y), z) :=

-- We don't yet have an API for tensor products indexed by finite ordered types,
-- but it would be nice to state how monoidal functors preserve these.
/-- If `F` is a monoidal functor out of `Type`, it takes the (n+1)st cartesian power
of a type to the image of that type, tensored with the image of the nth cartesian power. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant2dfce398b0de5c067b31d7f3b97a1b180a0a4a0d02a086088fcb5d0dd3b5a921.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant2dfce398b0de5c067b31d7f3b97a1b180a0a4a0d02a086088fcb5d0dd3b5a921.lean#L75).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `700b3a97ee56f78498bc8b679270fc4e0ebec12f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
