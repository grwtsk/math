## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1e987c59-360f-58de-a281-b2f5e64b8bcc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 464–482.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem imageIsoImage_inv :
    (imageIsoImage f).inv =
      kernel.lift _ (Limits.image.ι f) (by simp [← cancel_epi (factorThruImage f)]) := by
  ext
  rw [IsImage.isoExt_inv, image.isImage_lift, Limits.image.fac_lift,
    imageStrongEpiMonoFactorisation_e, Category.assoc, kernel.lift_ι, equalizer_as_kernel,
    kernel.lift_ι, Limits.image.fac]

section CokernelOfKernel

variable {X Y : C} {f : X ⟶ Y}

attribute [local instance] nonPreadditiveAbelian

/-- In an abelian category, an epi is the cokernel of its kernel. More precisely:
    If `f` is an epimorphism and `s` is some limit kernel cone on `f`, then `f` is a cokernel
    of `fork.ι s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant824a6beaa541a440797778d7ac22e10d49fb2f67301c241dee96e64ce9d9c2f9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant824a6beaa541a440797778d7ac22e10d49fb2f67301c241dee96e64ce9d9c2f9.lean#L464).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7f9b9fa1702bacda407e8a5d126090d46cfdac41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
