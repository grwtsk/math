## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:912a7c3db6390be9fbe43f71a1049e410285c2d9851a5144b7fb4f9ff9b00325`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Category (Dial C) where
  Hom := Dial.Hom
  id X := {
    f := 𝟙 _
    F := π₂
    le := by simp
  }
  comp {_ _ _} (F G : Dial.Hom ..) := {
    f := F.f ≫ G.f
    F := π(π₁, prod.map F.f (𝟙 _) ≫ G.F) ≫ F.F
    le := comp_le_lemma F G
  }
  assoc f g h := by
    simp only [Category.assoc, Hom.mk.injEq, true_and]
    rw [← Category.assoc, ← Category.assoc]; congr 1
    ext <;> simp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantab583c581404713e25e29673796a9526977ddb5c0a784ad282ba7899f9255933.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variantab583c581404713e25e29673796a9526977ddb5c0a784ad282ba7899f9255933.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9445f7de8e6c25489b9c57d04ad0b415ba19f0a0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
