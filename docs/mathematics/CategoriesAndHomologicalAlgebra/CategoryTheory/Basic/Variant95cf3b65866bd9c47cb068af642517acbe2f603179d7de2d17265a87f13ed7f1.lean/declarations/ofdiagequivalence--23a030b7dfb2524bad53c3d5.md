## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a2a5b62b4e53f6c9d8bc0f71ebb64fe627cf86cffa1cccbb73f10d48b93b2be5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1041–1050.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofDiagEquivalence (X : T × T) :
    CostructuredArrow (Functor.diag _) X ≌ CostructuredArrow (Over.forget X.1) X.2 where
  functor := ofDiagEquivalence.functor X
  inverse := ofDiagEquivalence.inverse X
  unitIso := NatIso.ofComponents (fun _ => Iso.refl _) (by simp)
  counitIso := NatIso.ofComponents (fun _ => Iso.refl _) (by aesop_cat)

/-- A version of `CostructuredArrow.ofDiagEquivalence` with the roles of the first and second
projection swapped. -/
-- noncomputability is only for performance
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant95cf3b65866bd9c47cb068af642517acbe2f603179d7de2d17265a87f13ed7f1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant95cf3b65866bd9c47cb068af642517acbe2f603179d7de2d17265a87f13ed7f1.lean#L1041).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `23f10e5b89c71e92c7397ded8f9ec69cea66af85` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
