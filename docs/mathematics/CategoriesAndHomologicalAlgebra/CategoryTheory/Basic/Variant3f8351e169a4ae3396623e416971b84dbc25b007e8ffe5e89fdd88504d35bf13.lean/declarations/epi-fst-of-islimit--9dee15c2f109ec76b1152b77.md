## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6a3232d5-b040-c914-15d5-04244f9b1f1a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 718–725.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem epi_fst_of_isLimit [Epi g] {s : PullbackCone f g} (hs : IsLimit s) : Epi s.fst := by
  have : Epi (NatTrans.app (limit.cone (cospan f g)).π WalkingCospan.left) :=
    Abelian.epi_pullback_of_epi_g f g
  apply epi_of_epi_fac (IsLimit.conePointUniqueUpToIso_hom_comp (limit.isLimit _) hs _)

/-- Suppose `f` and `g` are two morphisms with a common codomain and suppose we have written `g` as
    an epimorphism followed by a monomorphism. If `f` factors through the mono part of this
    factorization, then any pullback of `g` along `f` is an epimorphism. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant3f8351e169a4ae3396623e416971b84dbc25b007e8ffe5e89fdd88504d35bf13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant3f8351e169a4ae3396623e416971b84dbc25b007e8ffe5e89fdd88504d35bf13.lean#L718).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `143fe964376d73bccb6a1e35b4c4f637e83256f2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
