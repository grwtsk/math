## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a8c85711ae80c76605731ed15c059ff7bb383576c3a18a62993d2c6e982c5a2a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 759–780.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance mono_pushout_of_mono_g [Mono g] : Mono (pushout.inl f g) :=
  mono_of_cancel_zero _ fun {R} e h => by
    let u := biprod.lift e (0 : R ⟶ Z)
    have hu : u ≫ BiproductToPushoutIsCokernel.biproductToPushout f g = 0 := by simpa [u]
    have :=
      monoIsKernelOfCokernel _
        (BiproductToPushoutIsCokernel.isColimitBiproductToPushout f g)
    obtain ⟨d, hd⟩ := KernelFork.IsLimit.lift' this u hu
    dsimp at d
    dsimp [u] at hd
    have : d ≫ (-g) = 0 := calc
      d ≫ (-g) = d ≫ biprod.lift f (-g) ≫ biprod.snd := by rw [biprod.lift_snd]
      _ = biprod.lift e (0 : R ⟶ Z) ≫ biprod.snd := by rw [← Category.assoc, hd]
      _ = 0 := biprod.lift_snd _ _
    have : d = 0 := (cancel_mono (-g)).1 (by simpa)
    calc
      e = biprod.lift e (0 : R ⟶ Z) ≫ biprod.fst := by rw [biprod.lift_fst]
      _ = (d ≫ biprod.lift f (-g)) ≫ biprod.fst := by rw [← hd]
      _ = (0 ≫ biprod.lift f (-g)) ≫ biprod.fst := by rw [this]
      _ = 0 ≫ biprod.lift f (-g) ≫ biprod.fst := by rw [Category.assoc]
      _ = 0 := zero_comp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant3f8351e169a4ae3396623e416971b84dbc25b007e8ffe5e89fdd88504d35bf13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Basic/Variant3f8351e169a4ae3396623e416971b84dbc25b007e8ffe5e89fdd88504d35bf13.lean#L759).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `143fe964376d73bccb6a1e35b4c4f637e83256f2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
