## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d64ff6529b096a37cf82fd64dc18dcd874dcf234f33927d754aed4c2ed96557c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–84.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def FactorsThruAlong {X Y : C} (S : Presieve Y) (T : Presieve X) (f : Y ⟶ X) : Prop :=
  ∀ ⦃Z : C⦄ ⦃g : Z ⟶ Y⦄, S g →
  ∃ (W : C) (i : Z ⟶ W) (e : W ⟶ X), T e ∧ i ≫ e = g ≫ f

/--
Given `S T : Presieve X`, we say that `S` factors through `T` if any morphism in `S`
factors through some morphism in `T`.

The lemma `Presieve.isSheafFor_of_factorsThru` gives a *sufficient* condition for a
presheaf to be a sheaf for a presieve `T`, in terms of `S.FactorsThru T`, provided
that the presheaf is a sheaf for `S`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Coverage/Variant5d70c2ff01f98333bb57cf0a2e1e2caae8783bbf33047aa013282edcccb0d766.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Coverage/Variant5d70c2ff01f98333bb57cf0a2e1e2caae8783bbf33047aa013282edcccb0d766.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93b544a90e4c8fc6af8f7b29045f9b8484689c1d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
