## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:88c33b9f1aa45602c0261217d40ea4556f8903b8e86fc67ce9ecf339cadafa46`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 37–46.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [Precoherent C] [HasFiniteCoproducts C] : Preregular C where
  exists_fac {X Y Z} f g _ := by
    have hp := Precoherent.pullback f PUnit (fun () ↦ Z) (fun () ↦ g)
    simp only [exists_const] at hp
    rw [← effectiveEpi_iff_effectiveEpiFamily g] at hp
    obtain ⟨β, _, X₂, π₂, h, ι, hι⟩ := hp inferInstance
    refine ⟨∐ X₂, Sigma.desc π₂, inferInstance, Sigma.desc ι, ?_⟩
    ext b
    simpa using hι b

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Comparison/Variantfda4a0d8f35de53bef9e6eabe567c4648ee69e1e3eaf5e81154a7c575e88dea6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Comparison/Variantfda4a0d8f35de53bef9e6eabe567c4648ee69e1e3eaf5e81154a7c575e88dea6.lean#L37).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c4ec2ffe17a9d79767fe0f705673ef38fab22484` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
