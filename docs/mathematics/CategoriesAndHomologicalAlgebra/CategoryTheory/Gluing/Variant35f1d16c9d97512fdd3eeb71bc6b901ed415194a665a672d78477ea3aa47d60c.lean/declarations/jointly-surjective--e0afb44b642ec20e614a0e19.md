## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4bcb06fe-5942-0ca0-97aa-6a11dafb8040`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 525–551.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem ι_jointly_surjective (x : 𝖣.glued) : ∃ (i : D.J) (y : D.U i), (𝖣.ι i).base y = x :=
  𝖣.ι_jointly_surjective (PresheafedSpace.forget _ ⋙ CategoryTheory.forget TopCat) x

end GlueData

end PresheafedSpace

namespace SheafedSpace

/-- A family of gluing data consists of
1. An index type `J`
2. A sheafed space `U i` for each `i : J`.
3. A sheafed space `V i j` for each `i j : J`.
  (Note that this is `J × J → SheafedSpace C` rather than `J → J → SheafedSpace C` to
  connect to the limits library easier.)
4. An open immersion `f i j : V i j ⟶ U i` for each `i j : ι`.
5. A transition map `t i j : V i j ⟶ V j i` for each `i j : ι`.
such that
6. `f i i` is an isomorphism.
7. `t i i` is the identity.
8. `V i j ×[U i] V i k ⟶ V i j ⟶ V j i` factors through `V j k ×[U j] V j i ⟶ V j i` via some
    `t' : V i j ×[U i] V i k ⟶ V j k ×[U j] V j i`.
9. `t' i j k ≫ t' j k i ≫ t' k i j = 𝟙 _`.

We can then glue the spaces `U i` together by identifying `V i j` with `V j i`, such
that the `U i`'s are open subspaces of the glued space.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Gluing/Variant35f1d16c9d97512fdd3eeb71bc6b901ed415194a665a672d78477ea3aa47d60c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Gluing/Variant35f1d16c9d97512fdd3eeb71bc6b901ed415194a665a672d78477ea3aa47d60c.lean#L525).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4e6d1d416ea9780fe285b3c8057f66c02528deb1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
