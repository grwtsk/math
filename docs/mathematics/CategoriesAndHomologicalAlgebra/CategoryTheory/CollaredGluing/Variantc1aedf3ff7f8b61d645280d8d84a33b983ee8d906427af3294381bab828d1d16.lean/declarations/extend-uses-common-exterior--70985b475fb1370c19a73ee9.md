## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:43a0c433-36c7-71a8-a5f4-763341c854e3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 298–314.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem extend_uses_common_exterior
    (C : CollaredGluingCapability T G)
    {exterior : C.Exterior} {P Q : C.Piece}
    (hP : C.Compatible exterior P) (hQ : C.Compatible exterior Q)
    (f : C.PieceHom P Q) :
    G.selectedExterior (C.extend hP hQ f) = C.commonExterior exterior P Q :=
  C.extend_selected_exterior hP hQ f

end CollaredGluingCapability

/--
A collared presentation of one framed surgery using a fixed exterior.

The two charts identify the abstract gluing with the original manifold and
with the surgery operation.  Their existence is geometric input, not a
consequence of the bare embedding type.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CollaredGluing/Variantc1aedf3ff7f8b61d645280d8d84a33b983ee8d906427af3294381bab828d1d16.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CollaredGluing/Variantc1aedf3ff7f8b61d645280d8d84a33b983ee8d906427af3294381bab828d1d16.lean#L298).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d4a75eacee9cdb7f88e8c066c1e13864d1203bf5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
