## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2e174d75673023d06e1fc39f2f33cc950d63ba76730ea52801036d2b32e921fd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 386–401.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def replacementComparison
    (P₀ : CollaredSurgeryPresentation G C e₀ exterior)
    (P₁ : CollaredSurgeryPresentation G C e₁ exterior)
    (f : C.PieceHom P₀.replacementPiece P₁.replacementPiece) :
    G.Hom (T.surgery e₀) (T.surgery e₁) :=
  G.trans (G.symm P₀.surgeryChart)
    (G.trans
      (C.extend P₀.replacement_compatible P₁.replacement_compatible f)
      P₁.surgeryChart)

/--
A collar-compatible comparison of the removed pieces extends across the
common exterior and is transported through the two original-manifold charts.
Unlike `replacementComparison`, this map uses the removed-piece presentation
and certifies compatibility on the unsurgered side.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CollaredGluing/Variant028caddd5fffc621a574448e085382a8d64f9582f36c0f24a56f189639a03062.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CollaredGluing/Variant028caddd5fffc621a574448e085382a8d64f9582f36c0f24a56f189639a03062.lean#L386).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ad5b2c1632758190f181bb876d10e8badc791175` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
