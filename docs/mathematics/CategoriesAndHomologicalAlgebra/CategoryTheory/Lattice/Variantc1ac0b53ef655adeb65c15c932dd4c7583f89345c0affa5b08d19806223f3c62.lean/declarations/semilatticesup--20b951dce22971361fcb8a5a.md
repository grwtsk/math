## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5111be83b201852670a3ce77afcb8ec478de9571229203b2b3d3ba15d5eba49e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 526–532.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance semilatticeSup {B : C} : SemilatticeSup (Subobject B) where
  sup := fun m n => (sup.obj m).obj n
  le_sup_left := fun m n => Quotient.inductionOn₂' m n fun _ _ => ⟨MonoOver.leSupLeft _ _⟩
  le_sup_right := fun m n => Quotient.inductionOn₂' m n fun _ _ => ⟨MonoOver.leSupRight _ _⟩
  sup_le := fun m n k =>
    Quotient.inductionOn₃' m n k fun _ _ _ ⟨i⟩ ⟨j⟩ => ⟨MonoOver.supLe _ _ _ i j⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Lattice/Variantc1ac0b53ef655adeb65c15c932dd4c7583f89345c0affa5b08d19806223f3c62.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Lattice/Variantc1ac0b53ef655adeb65c15c932dd4c7583f89345c0affa5b08d19806223f3c62.lean#L526).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d0da1420c6857c7df321c9a49f74738c6a073bd4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
