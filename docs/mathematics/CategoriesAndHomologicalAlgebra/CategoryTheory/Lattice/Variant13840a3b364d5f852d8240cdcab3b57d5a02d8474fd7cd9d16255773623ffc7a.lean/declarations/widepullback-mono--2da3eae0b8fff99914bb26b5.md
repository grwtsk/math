## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b66f14aba8722a524b252c013c583c3e3243027f83863670aae1d7509aff5dd1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 563–574.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance widePullbackι_mono {A : C} (s : Set (Subobject A)) : Mono (widePullbackι s) :=
  ⟨fun u v h =>
    limit.hom_ext fun j => by
      cases j
      · exact h
      · apply (cancel_mono ((equivShrink (Subobject A)).symm _).arrow).1
        rw [assoc, assoc]
        erw [limit.w (wideCospan s) (WidePullbackShape.Hom.term _)]
        exact h⟩

/-- When `[WellPowered C]` and `[HasWidePullbacks C]`, `Subobject A` has arbitrary infimums.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Lattice/Variant13840a3b364d5f852d8240cdcab3b57d5a02d8474fd7cd9d16255773623ffc7a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Lattice/Variant13840a3b364d5f852d8240cdcab3b57d5a02d8474fd7cd9d16255773623ffc7a.lean#L563).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3e15f01b61d6220d084d86b748c86d7136df76a5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
