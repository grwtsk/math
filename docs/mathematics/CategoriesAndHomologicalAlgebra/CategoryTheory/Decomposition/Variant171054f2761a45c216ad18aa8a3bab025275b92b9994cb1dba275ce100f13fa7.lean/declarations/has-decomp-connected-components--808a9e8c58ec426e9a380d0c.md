## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5029bf3e-bdb3-4b88-b49c-25fcf1642b4b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem has_decomp_connected_components' (X : C) :
    ∃ (ι : Type) (_ : Finite ι) (f : ι → C) (_ : ∐ f ≅ X), ∀ i, IsConnected (f i) := by
  obtain ⟨ι, f, g, hl, hc, hf⟩ := has_decomp_connected_components X
  exact ⟨ι, hf, f, colimit.isoColimitCocone ⟨Cofan.mk X g, hl⟩, hc⟩

variable (F : C ⥤ FintypeCat.{w}) [FiberFunctor F]

/-- Every element in the fiber of `X` lies in some connected component of `X`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Decomposition/Variant171054f2761a45c216ad18aa8a3bab025275b92b9994cb1dba275ce100f13fa7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Decomposition/Variant171054f2761a45c216ad18aa8a3bab025275b92b9994cb1dba275ce100f13fa7.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `37f5ba335107f31df8a5f24f6b727f3a94be0cab` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
