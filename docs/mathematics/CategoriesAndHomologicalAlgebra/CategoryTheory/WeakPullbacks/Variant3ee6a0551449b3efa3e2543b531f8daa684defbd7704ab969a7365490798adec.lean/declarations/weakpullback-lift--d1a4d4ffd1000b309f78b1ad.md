## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b90fd30042a98520c0486fb0768439ee5547cfeedb0584c36e31b2738f451d2e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 109–115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def weakPullback.lift' {W X Y Z : C} {f : X ⟶ Z} {g : Y ⟶ Z} [HasWeakPullback f g]
    (h : W ⟶ X) (k : W ⟶ Y) (w : h ≫ f = k ≫ g) :
      { l : W ⟶ weakPullback f g //
      l ≫ weakPullback.fst f g = h ∧ l ≫ weakPullback.snd f g = k } :=
  ⟨weakPullback.lift h k w, weakPullback.lift_fst _ _ _, weakPullback.lift_snd _ _ _⟩

@[reassoc]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/WeakPullbacks/Variant3ee6a0551449b3efa3e2543b531f8daa684defbd7704ab969a7365490798adec.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/WeakPullbacks/Variant3ee6a0551449b3efa3e2543b531f8daa684defbd7704ab969a7365490798adec.lean#L109).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a3067cfc8db96867e1608d6a1268aab5c9a9f17e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
