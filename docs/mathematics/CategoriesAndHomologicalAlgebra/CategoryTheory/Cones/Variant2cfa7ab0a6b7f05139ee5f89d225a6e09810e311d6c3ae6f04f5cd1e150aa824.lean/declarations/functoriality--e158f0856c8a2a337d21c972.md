## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:626973a192f427e7abc1c5e20046272e8f0c713152746d13ec1470abce557c73`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 405–415.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def functoriality : Cone F ⥤ Cone (F ⋙ G) where
  obj A :=
    { pt := G.obj A.pt
      π :=
        { app := fun j => G.map (A.π.app j)
          naturality := by intros; erw [← G.map_comp]; simp } }
  map f :=
    { hom := G.map f.hom
      w := fun j => by simp [-ConeMorphism.w, ← f.w j] }

/-- Functoriality is functorial. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Cones/Variant2cfa7ab0a6b7f05139ee5f89d225a6e09810e311d6c3ae6f04f5cd1e150aa824.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Cones/Variant2cfa7ab0a6b7f05139ee5f89d225a6e09810e311d6c3ae6f04f5cd1e150aa824.lean#L405).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a8997cfb2981400718cc18c12a426172e6160949` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
