## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4eda32da16f20cdbef74252a3aad41382c2c0fdca5b23a24b817c614bb067ae2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 717–722.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def mapConeInvMapCone {F : J ⥤ D} (H : D ⥤ C) [IsEquivalence H] (c : Cone F) :
    mapConeInv H (mapCone H c) ≅ c :=
  (Limits.Cones.functorialityEquivalence F (asEquivalence H)).unitIso.symm.app c

/-- If `H` is an equivalence, we invert `H.mapCone` and get a cone for `F` from a cone
for `F ⋙ H`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Cones/Variant56fc06aff20b0551704a5c1222dea582e53c0f67bd2a4f029aed501cd58c27d4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Cones/Variant56fc06aff20b0551704a5c1222dea582e53c0f67bd2a4f029aed501cd58c27d4.lean#L717).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `520de284c419654a24187ec4d244635d38626ac3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
