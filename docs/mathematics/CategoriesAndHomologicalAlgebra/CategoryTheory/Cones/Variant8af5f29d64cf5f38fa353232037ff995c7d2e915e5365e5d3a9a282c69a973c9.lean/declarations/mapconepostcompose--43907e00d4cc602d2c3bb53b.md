## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9aa4cf8f2aa5650ab054697d12284df4fac0586b317bc64653f59120ec59ccec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 778–786.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mapConePostcompose {α : F ⟶ G} {c} :
    mapCone H ((Cones.postcompose α).obj c) ≅
      (Cones.postcompose (whiskerRight α H : _)).obj (mapCone H c) :=
  Cones.ext (Iso.refl _)
#align category_theory.functor.map_cone_postcompose CategoryTheory.Functor.mapConePostcompose

/-- `mapCone` commutes with `postcomposeEquivalence`

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Cones/Variant8af5f29d64cf5f38fa353232037ff995c7d2e915e5365e5d3a9a282c69a973c9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Cones/Variant8af5f29d64cf5f38fa353232037ff995c7d2e915e5365e5d3a9a282c69a973c9.lean#L778).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d182de4914d4364a5abeb889c5adcca21ec3155d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
