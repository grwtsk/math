## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0f02fb6fa093edd67de3b2700ce223a07f90b994ee697486016a12535da16629`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 252–261.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance preservesLimitsOfShape_presheafToSheaf :
    PreservesLimitsOfShape K (presheafToSheaf J D) := by
  constructor; intro F; constructor; intro S hS
  apply isLimitOfReflects (sheafToPresheaf J D)
  have : ReflectsLimitsOfShape K (forget D) := reflectsLimitsOfShapeOfReflectsIsomorphisms
  -- porting note: the mathlib proof was by `apply is_limit_of_preserves (J.sheafification D) hS`
  have : PreservesLimitsOfShape K (presheafToSheaf J D ⋙ sheafToPresheaf J D) :=
    preservesLimitsOfShapeOfNatIso (J.sheafificationIsoPresheafToSheafCompSheafToPreasheaf D)
  exact isLimitOfPreserves (presheafToSheaf J D ⋙ sheafToPresheaf J D) hS

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LeftExact/Variant5a40e15c7fad010181a8f045f523d4ab0be92d83fef55ed794d6e39d8698685d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LeftExact/Variant5a40e15c7fad010181a8f045f523d4ab0be92d83fef55ed794d6e39d8698685d.lean#L252).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `684f1b83112793875c088b489fac50aeb1ab5892` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
