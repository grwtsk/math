## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c869152d0af49bc4291ddf3ab6070fe7160b1d42b923e112572109b379a9d4b0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 229–251.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance preservesFiniteLimits_sheafification
    [HasFiniteLimits D] [PreservesFiniteLimits (forget D)] [ReflectsIsomorphisms (forget D)] :
    PreservesFiniteLimits (J.sheafification D) :=
  Limits.compPreservesFiniteLimits _ _

end CategoryTheory.GrothendieckTopology

namespace CategoryTheory

variable [∀ X : C, HasColimitsOfShape (J.Cover X)ᵒᵖ D]

variable [ConcreteCategory.{max v u} D]

variable [∀ X : C, PreservesColimitsOfShape (J.Cover X)ᵒᵖ (forget D)]

variable [PreservesLimits (forget D)]

variable [ReflectsIsomorphisms (forget D)]

variable (K : Type max v u)

variable [SmallCategory K] [FinCategory K] [HasLimitsOfShape K D]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LeftExact/Variant5a40e15c7fad010181a8f045f523d4ab0be92d83fef55ed794d6e39d8698685d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LeftExact/Variant5a40e15c7fad010181a8f045f523d4ab0be92d83fef55ed794d6e39d8698685d.lean#L229).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `684f1b83112793875c088b489fac50aeb1ab5892` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
