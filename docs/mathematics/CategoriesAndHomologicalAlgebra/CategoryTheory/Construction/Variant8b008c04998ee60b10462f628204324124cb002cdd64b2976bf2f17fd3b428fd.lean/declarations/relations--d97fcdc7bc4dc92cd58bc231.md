## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dee6758c0020cd0152648888426ca0c6b6272e40e2bcc4cd401dbaca6d7e7eee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 85–100.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive relations : HomRel (Paths (LocQuiver W))
  | id (X : C) : relations (ψ₁ W (𝟙 X)) (𝟙 _)
  | comp {X Y Z : C} (f : X ⟶ Y) (g : Y ⟶ Z) : relations (ψ₁ W (f ≫ g)) (ψ₁ W f ≫ ψ₁ W g)
  | Winv₁ {X Y : C} (w : X ⟶ Y) (hw : W w) : relations (ψ₁ W w ≫ ψ₂ W w hw) (𝟙 _)
  | Winv₂ {X Y : C} (w : X ⟶ Y) (hw : W w) : relations (ψ₂ W w hw ≫ ψ₁ W w) (𝟙 _)

end Construction

open Localization.Construction

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Construction/Variant8b008c04998ee60b10462f628204324124cb002cdd64b2976bf2f17fd3b428fd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Construction/Variant8b008c04998ee60b10462f628204324124cb002cdd64b2976bf2f17fd3b428fd.lean#L85).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a39d0c8fd608a75eae797d0526e0020ee5d2a66f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
