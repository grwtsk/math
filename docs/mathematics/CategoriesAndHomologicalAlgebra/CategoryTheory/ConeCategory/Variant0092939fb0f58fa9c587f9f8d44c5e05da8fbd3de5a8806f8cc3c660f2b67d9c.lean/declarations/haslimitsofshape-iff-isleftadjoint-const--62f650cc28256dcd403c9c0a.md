## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:25621058-30d7-0400-e977-f4f92bfc20a3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 172–182.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasLimitsOfShape_iff_isLeftAdjoint_const :
    HasLimitsOfShape J C ↔ IsLeftAdjoint (const J : C ⥤ _) :=
  calc
    HasLimitsOfShape J C ↔ ∀ F : J ⥤ C, HasLimit F :=
      ⟨fun h => h.has_limit, fun h => HasLimitsOfShape.mk⟩
    _ ↔ ∀ F : J ⥤ C, HasTerminal (Cone F) := forall_congr' hasLimit_iff_hasTerminal_cone
    _ ↔ ∀ F : J ⥤ C, HasTerminal (CostructuredArrow (const J) F) :=
      (forall_congr' fun F => (Cone.equivCostructuredArrow F).hasTerminal_iff)
    _ ↔ (IsLeftAdjoint (const J : C ⥤ _)) :=
      isLeftAdjoint_iff_hasTerminal_costructuredArrow.symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ConeCategory/Variant0092939fb0f58fa9c587f9f8d44c5e05da8fbd3de5a8806f8cc3c660f2b67d9c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ConeCategory/Variant0092939fb0f58fa9c587f9f8d44c5e05da8fbd3de5a8806f8cc3c660f2b67d9c.lean#L172).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c16bface3599ea91f0b0bd1a4b41d65b07dccd5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
