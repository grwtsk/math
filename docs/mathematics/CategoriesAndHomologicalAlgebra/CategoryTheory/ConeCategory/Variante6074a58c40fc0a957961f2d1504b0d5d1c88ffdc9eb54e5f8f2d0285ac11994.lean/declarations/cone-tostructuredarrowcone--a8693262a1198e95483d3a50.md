## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b55b0fd06365525808ad2d1d4b7bfdd9f23993ac9c0d4c693433dbb42b2efff2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–102.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Cone.toStructuredArrowCone {K : J ⥤ C} (c : Cone K) (F : C ⥤ D) {X : D} (f : X ⟶ F.obj c.pt) :
    Cone ((F.mapCone c).toStructuredArrow ⋙ StructuredArrow.map f ⋙ StructuredArrow.pre _ K F) where
  pt := StructuredArrow.mk f
  π := { app := fun j => StructuredArrow.homMk (c.π.app j) rfl }
#align category_theory.structured_arrow_cone.to_cone CategoryTheory.Limits.Cone.toStructuredArrowCone

/-- Construct an object of the category `(Δ ↓ F)` from a cone on `F`. This is part of an
    equivalence, see `Cone.equivCostructuredArrow`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ConeCategory/Variante6074a58c40fc0a957961f2d1504b0d5d1c88ffdc9eb54e5f8f2d0285ac11994.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ConeCategory/Variante6074a58c40fc0a957961f2d1504b0d5d1c88ffdc9eb54e5f8f2d0285ac11994.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `49d87e8bffa831e76be3b00e82ff78b4d51dac23` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
