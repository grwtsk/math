## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e3adc93e766afce6242e38db86e77a68cd6e4ab16d32c51699624f87c923e4de`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 86–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def summand (Δ : SimplexCategoryᵒᵖ) (A : Splitting.IndexSet Δ) : C :=
  K.X A.1.unop.len
#align algebraic_topology.dold_kan.Γ₀.obj.summand AlgebraicTopology.DoldKan.Γ₀.Obj.summand

/-- The functor `Γ₀` sends a chain complex `K` to the simplicial object which
sends `Δ` to the direct sum of the objects `summand K Δ A` for all `A : Splitting.IndexSet Δ` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FunctorGamma/Variant5a254b8eeae204c4a1918c96188e5607977898acd18f0acabbeabbd11fa758cb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FunctorGamma/Variant5a254b8eeae204c4a1918c96188e5607977898acd18f0acabbeabbd11fa758cb.lean#L86).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2da03bb257a35794629723e95a364ea5bfb7a84d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
