## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8c22d2d2-9d85-30ca-2de9-ddefeb509d53`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma extEquiv_naturality_left (adj : F ⊣ G) {X₁ X₂ : C} {Y : D} {a b : ℕ}
    (e : Ext X₁ X₂ a) (e' : Ext (F.obj X₂) Y b) {c : ℕ} (h : a + b = c) :
    adj.extEquiv ((e.mapExactFunctor F).comp e' h) =
      e.comp (adj.extEquiv e') h := by
  rw [extEquiv_apply, extEquiv_apply, Ext.mapExactFunctor_comp,
    ← Ext.comp_mapExactFunctor,
    ← Ext.comp_assoc _ _ _ (zero_add a) (by lia) (by lia),
    ← Ext.mapExactFunctor_comp_mk₀_natTransApp]
  simp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/MapAdjunction/Varianta313c779016a2dc9a933528a1918030465850cc24fdccda50081fb1c112b9646.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/MapAdjunction/Varianta313c779016a2dc9a933528a1918030465850cc24fdccda50081fb1c112b9646.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8f8fbd050dc0925228ad342a407621f06ce70290` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
