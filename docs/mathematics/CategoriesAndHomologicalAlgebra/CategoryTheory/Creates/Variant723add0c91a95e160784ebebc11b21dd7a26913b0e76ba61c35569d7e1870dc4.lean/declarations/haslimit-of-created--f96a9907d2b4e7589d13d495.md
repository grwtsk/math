## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:19306f84-af34-1c44-d18d-94f814b2b544`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 166–174.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasLimit_of_created (K : J ⥤ C) (F : C ⥤ D) [HasLimit (K ⋙ F)] [CreatesLimit K F] :
    HasLimit K :=
  HasLimit.mk
    { cone := liftLimit (limit.isLimit (K ⋙ F))
      isLimit := liftedLimitIsLimit _ }

/-- If `F` creates limits of shape `J`, and `D` has limits of shape `J`, then
`C` has limits of shape `J`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Creates/Variant723add0c91a95e160784ebebc11b21dd7a26913b0e76ba61c35569d7e1870dc4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Creates/Variant723add0c91a95e160784ebebc11b21dd7a26913b0e76ba61c35569d7e1870dc4.lean#L166).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a61005dca92999758e9193d2b8f9f0c19fedb467` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
