## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8bacd8d06d308c01b8150757db347038f2cd62f99778eef635dd26f90e30d4f4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 281–291.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def createsLimitOfFullyFaithfulOfLift' {K : J ⥤ C} {F : C ⥤ D} [F.Full] [F.Faithful]
    {l : Cone (K ⋙ F)} (hl : IsLimit l) (c : Cone K) (i : F.mapCone c ≅ l) :
    CreatesLimit K F :=
  createsLimitOfReflectsIso' hl ⟨⟨c, i⟩, isLimitOfReflects F (IsLimit.ofIsoLimit hl i.symm)⟩

-- Notice however that even if the isomorphism is `Iso.refl _`,
-- this construction will insert additional identity morphisms in the cone maps,
-- so the constructed limits may not be ideal, definitionally.
/-- When `F` is fully faithful, and `HasLimit (K ⋙ F)`, to show that `F` creates the limit for `K`
it suffices to exhibit a lift of the chosen limit cone for `K ⋙ F`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Creates/Variant73551384beaa1244ebe4197547e8190cbfd2a2d08704b99afd2fed06c81ca539.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Creates/Variant73551384beaa1244ebe4197547e8190cbfd2a2d08704b99afd2fed06c81ca539.lean#L281).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `08d325d60df547c229e589cfd610fcbdad42a4a0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
