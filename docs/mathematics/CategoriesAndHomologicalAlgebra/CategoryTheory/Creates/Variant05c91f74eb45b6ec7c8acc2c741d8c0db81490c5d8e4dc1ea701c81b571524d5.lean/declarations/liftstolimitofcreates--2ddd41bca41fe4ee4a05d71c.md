## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6919726866dd04796394267481455ea879ef1f4c7932f3b70ba1acff0cb5385f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 608–615.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def liftsToLimitOfCreates (K : J ⥤ C) (F : C ⥤ D) [CreatesLimit K F] (c : Cone (K ⋙ F))
    (t : IsLimit c) : LiftsToLimit K F c t where
  liftedCone := liftLimit t
  validLift := liftedLimitMapsToOriginal t
  makesLimit := liftedLimitIsLimit t

-- For the inhabited linter later.
/-- If F creates the colimit of K, any cocone lifts to a colimit. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Creates/Variant05c91f74eb45b6ec7c8acc2c741d8c0db81490c5d8e4dc1ea701c81b571524d5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Creates/Variant05c91f74eb45b6ec7c8acc2c741d8c0db81490c5d8e4dc1ea701c81b571524d5.lean#L608).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `30b3282de3e69f12c3488b168128f22f9b751d0d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
