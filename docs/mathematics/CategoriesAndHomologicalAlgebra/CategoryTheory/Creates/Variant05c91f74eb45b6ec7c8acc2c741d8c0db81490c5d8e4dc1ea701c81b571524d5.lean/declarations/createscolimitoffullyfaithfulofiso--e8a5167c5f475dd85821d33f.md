## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:aba0e6c9b2f31e5e9e4ccf4d6f4af201afd474e9c074a7c2d19afe7136ad15bf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 449–467.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def createsColimitOfFullyFaithfulOfIso' {K : J ⥤ C} {F : C ⥤ D} [F.Full] [F.Faithful]
    {l : Cocone (K ⋙ F)} (hl : IsColimit l) (X : C) (i : F.obj X ≅ l.pt) : CreatesColimit K F :=
  createsColimitOfFullyFaithfulOfLift' hl
    { pt := X
      ι :=
        { app := fun j => F.preimage (l.ι.app j ≫ i.inv)
          naturality := fun Y Z f =>
            F.map_injective <| by
              dsimp
              simpa [← cancel_mono i.hom] using l.w f } }
    (Cocones.ext i fun j => by simp)

-- Notice however that even if the isomorphism is `Iso.refl _`,
-- this construction will insert additional identity morphisms in the cocone maps,
-- so the constructed colimits may not be ideal, definitionally.
/--
When `F` is fully faithful, and `HasColimit (K ⋙ F)`, to show that `F` creates the colimit for `K`
it suffices to show that the chosen colimit point is in the essential image of `F`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Creates/Variant05c91f74eb45b6ec7c8acc2c741d8c0db81490c5d8e4dc1ea701c81b571524d5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Creates/Variant05c91f74eb45b6ec7c8acc2c741d8c0db81490c5d8e4dc1ea701c81b571524d5.lean#L449).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `30b3282de3e69f12c3488b168128f22f9b751d0d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
