## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:58d0c4ee7304d4d1420481e394b05a91b48b8f153906d8028feaaf6fd96fd5d6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 308–312.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class HasOfPostcompProperty (W W' : MorphismProperty C) : Prop where
  of_postcomp {X Y Z : C} (f : X ⟶ Y) (g : Y ⟶ Z) : W' g → W (f ≫ g) → W f

/-- A class of morphisms `W` has the of-precomp property wrt. `W'` if whenever
`f` is in `W'` and `f ≫ g` is in `W`, also `g` is in `W`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Composition/Variant32845912725b162934e00179af73db1101d5c2c65601ac3ca897eea6c443c312.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Composition/Variant32845912725b162934e00179af73db1101d5c2c65601ac3ca897eea6c443c312.lean#L308).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `57f8110d0116a6790b0d02d8225f6f84bc943706` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
