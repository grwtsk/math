## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4be6cc57a3a2411a5b7d0e7293e6df5c9f62d43ba474acce4267f5da66fa7589`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 371–387.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def adj : G.forget ⊣ G.cofree :=
  Adjunction.mkOfHomEquiv
    { homEquiv := fun X Y =>
        { toFun := fun f =>
            { f := X.a ≫ G.map f
              h := by simp [← Coalgebra.coassoc_assoc] }
          invFun := fun g => g.f ≫ G.ε.app Y
          left_inv := fun f => by
            dsimp
            rw [Category.assoc, G.ε.naturality, Functor.id_map, X.counit_assoc]
          right_inv := fun g => by
            ext1; dsimp
            rw [Functor.map_comp, g.h_assoc, cofree_obj_a, Comonad.right_counit]
            apply comp_id } }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Algebra/Variant2260fa156b6ab8d3e0005d2cfd9a439cd719f25c889beeb9b801fa6dae5930d6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Algebra/Variant2260fa156b6ab8d3e0005d2cfd9a439cd719f25c889beeb9b801fa6dae5930d6.lean#L371).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8d079fbafea6fe45740f80a84f465f34924f2d5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
