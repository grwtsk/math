## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ae06c3d7-dee6-6f09-e048-007f644dad3f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 432–440.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Coalgebra.homEquiv_naturality_str_symm (adj : F ⊣ G) (V₁ V₂ : Coalgebra G) (f : V₁ ⟶ V₂) :
    F.map f.f ≫ (adj.homEquiv V₂.V V₂.V).symm V₂.str =
    (adj.homEquiv V₁.V V₁.V).symm V₁.str ≫ f.f := by
  rw [← Adjunction.homEquiv_naturality_left_symm, ← Adjunction.homEquiv_naturality_right_symm,
    f.h]

/-- Given an adjunction `F ⊣ G`, the functor that associates to an algebra over `F` a
coalgebra over `G` defined via adjunction applied to the structure map. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Algebra/Variantb6e0480928da1425cf75f335711f092b836cb23d0dbc82fca96410e4a5054e37.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Algebra/Variantb6e0480928da1425cf75f335711f092b836cb23d0dbc82fca96410e4a5054e37.lean#L432).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `de95df6076431667588e818f994508b4b26415b6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
