## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9e9014d8457b6b478610e2d6226f2ac8348724889a120fce060bce7f63101ec4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 505–513.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def widePushoutShapeOpMap :
    ∀ X Y : WidePushoutShape J,
      (X ⟶ Y) → ((op X : (WidePullbackShape J)ᵒᵖ) ⟶ (op Y : (WidePullbackShape J)ᵒᵖ))
  | _, _, WidePushoutShape.Hom.id X => Quiver.Hom.op (WidePullbackShape.Hom.id _)
  | _, _, WidePushoutShape.Hom.init _ => Quiver.Hom.op (WidePullbackShape.Hom.term _)
#align category_theory.limits.wide_pushout_shape_op_map CategoryTheory.Limits.widePushoutShapeOpMap

/-- The obvious functor `WidePushoutShape J ⥤ (WidePullbackShape J)ᵒᵖ` -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/WidePullbacks/Variant171c999252c105fc54c46302072cf0505b8960e4447e92db853c41f12ed8f507.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/WidePullbacks/Variant171c999252c105fc54c46302072cf0505b8960e4447e92db853c41f12ed8f507.lean#L505).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e09a5bc9377f3dce662e0c94da65e38e1541ec2e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
