## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ea64857552edef8e3717302119da51c78cfe3049daa43c2831add5fdec5bc73a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 57–62.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable abbrev kernelFork :
    KernelFork (biprod.desc sq.f₂₄ (-sq.f₃₄)) :=
  KernelFork.ofι (biprod.lift sq.f₁₂ sq.f₁₃) (by simp [sq.fac])

/-- A commutative square in a preadditive category is a pullback square iff
the corresponding diagram `0 ⟶ X₁ ⟶ X₂ ⊞ X₃ ⟶ X₄ ⟶ 0` makes `X₁` a kernel. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Square/Variantd0987fd25c02ab40ed0884f514761666512e462b06cadfbd524821ee1e21d6d3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Square/Variantd0987fd25c02ab40ed0884f514761666512e462b06cadfbd524821ee1e21d6d3.lean#L57).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8ad613f8d5c0c98b98bee0c96433085201f1fe38` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
