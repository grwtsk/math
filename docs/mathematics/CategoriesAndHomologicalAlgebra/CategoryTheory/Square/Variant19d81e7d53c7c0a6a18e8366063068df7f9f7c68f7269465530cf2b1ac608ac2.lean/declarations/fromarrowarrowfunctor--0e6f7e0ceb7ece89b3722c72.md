## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:73d6a122e39ab8d05a73d20546526d199ef4567388ee708cec5a6b4185239161`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 195–210.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def fromArrowArrowFunctor : Arrow (Arrow C) ⥤ Square C where
  obj f := { fac := f.hom.w, .. }
  map φ :=
    { τ₁ := φ.left.left
      τ₂ := φ.right.left
      τ₃ := φ.left.right
      τ₄ := φ.right.right
      comm₁₂ := Arrow.leftFunc.congr_map φ.w.symm
      comm₁₃ := φ.left.w.symm
      comm₂₄ := φ.right.w.symm
      comm₃₄ := Arrow.rightFunc.congr_map φ.w.symm }

/-- The equivalence `Square C ≌ Arrow (Arrow C)` which sends a
commutative square `sq` to the obvious arrow from the left morphism of `sq`
to the right morphism of `sq`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Square/Variant19d81e7d53c7c0a6a18e8366063068df7f9f7c68f7269465530cf2b1ac608ac2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Square/Variant19d81e7d53c7c0a6a18e8366063068df7f9f7c68f7269465530cf2b1ac608ac2.lean#L195).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1649423248eee3ea43256f8810868ace50297f80` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
