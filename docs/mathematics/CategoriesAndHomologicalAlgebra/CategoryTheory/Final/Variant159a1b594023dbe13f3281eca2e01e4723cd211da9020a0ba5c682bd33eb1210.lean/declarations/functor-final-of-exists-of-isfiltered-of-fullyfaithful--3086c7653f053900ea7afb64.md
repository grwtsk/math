## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e8b78536-3e33-b390-e112-adf021068b60`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 182–191.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Functor.final_of_exists_of_isFiltered_of_fullyFaithful [IsFilteredOrEmpty D] [F.Full]
    [F.Faithful] (h : ∀ d, ∃ c, Nonempty (d ⟶ F.obj c)) : Final F := by
  have := IsFilteredOrEmpty.of_exists_of_isFiltered_of_fullyFaithful F h
  refine Functor.final_of_exists_of_isFiltered F h (fun {d c} s s' => ?_)
  obtain ⟨c₀, ⟨f⟩⟩ := h (IsFiltered.coeq s s')
  refine ⟨c₀, F.preimage (IsFiltered.coeqHom s s' ≫ f), ?_⟩
  simp [reassoc_of% (IsFiltered.coeq_condition s s')]

/-- In this situation, `C` is also cofiltered, see
    `IsCofilteredOrEmpty.of_exists_of_isCofiltered_of_fullyFaithful`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Final/Variant159a1b594023dbe13f3281eca2e01e4723cd211da9020a0ba5c682bd33eb1210.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Final/Variant159a1b594023dbe13f3281eca2e01e4723cd211da9020a0ba5c682bd33eb1210.lean#L182).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3d4252f7c42e003d21e3a296f36a9ebba69691b7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
