## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:24e4ba93-631c-0bc9-9dfa-51252f34b049`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 184–192.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    [Faithful F] (h : ∀ d, ∃ c, Nonempty (F.obj c ⟶ d)) : Initial F := by
  suffices Final F.op from initial_of_final_op _
  refine Functor.final_of_exists_of_isFiltered_of_fullyFaithful F.op (fun d => ?_)
  obtain ⟨c, ⟨f⟩⟩ := h d.unop
  exact ⟨op c, ⟨f.op⟩⟩

/-- Any under category on a filtered or empty category is filtered.
(Note that under categories are always cofiltered since they have an initial object.) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Final/Variant56b1ea9bd42bc70904d025ca245d6f46aa7d9f93c15df1347a3868705b95e460.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Final/Variant56b1ea9bd42bc70904d025ca245d6f46aa7d9f93c15df1347a3868705b95e460.lean#L184).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f9a44c3bd6ba4fdc148a33b8a0c240e30dbb6efc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
