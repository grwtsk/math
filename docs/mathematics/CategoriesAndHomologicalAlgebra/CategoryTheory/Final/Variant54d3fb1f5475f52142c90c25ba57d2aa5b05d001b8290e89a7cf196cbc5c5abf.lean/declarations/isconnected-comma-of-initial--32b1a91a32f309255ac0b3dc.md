## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9556639acacf585cd5ebca53585a82ec0be701bc48add6123f6670ea95a32e05`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
instance isConnected_comma_of_initial [IsConnected B] [L.Initial] : IsConnected (Comma L R) := by
  rwa [isConnected_iff_of_initial (snd L R)]

end NonSmall

/-- Let the following diagram commute up to isomorphism:

```
      L       R
  A  ---→ T  ←--- B
  |       |       |
  | F     | H     | G
  ↓       ↓       ↓
  A' ---→ T' ←--- B'
      L'      R'
```

Let `F`, `G`, `R` and `R'` be final and `B` be filtered. Then, the induced functor between the comma
categories of the first and second row of the diagram is final. -/
````

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Final/Variant54d3fb1f5475f52142c90c25ba57d2aa5b05d001b8290e89a7cf196cbc5c5abf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Final/Variant54d3fb1f5475f52142c90c25ba57d2aa5b05d001b8290e89a7cf196cbc5c5abf.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0477b3466294fb4dd92edb20b35dac1bc4211a31` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
