## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c52ce453f963db7776c2206cafee267bf45ca287e687297dd0872bf04c5c8602`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 487–498.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def homToLift (d : D) : F.obj (lift F d) ⟶ d :=
  (Classical.arbitrary (CostructuredArrow F d)).hom
#align category_theory.functor.initial.hom_to_lift CategoryTheory.Functor.Initial.homToLift

/-- We provide an induction principle for reasoning about `lift` and `homToLift`.
We want to perform some construction (usually just a proof) about
the particular choices `lift F d` and `homToLift F d`,
it suffices to perform that construction for some other pair of choices
(denoted `X₀ : C` and `k₀ : F.obj X₀ ⟶ d` below),
and to show how to transport such a construction
*both* directions along a morphism between such choices.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Final/Variant371444bca004bab78c760efbf89681e9d2b4f3a0127dad68cae7541469be8048.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Final/Variant371444bca004bab78c760efbf89681e9d2b4f3a0127dad68cae7541469be8048.lean#L487).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `eed7d9593346333a8b1ea74b3ef71e50fd587595` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
