## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bac4a859-2319-efa0-9ebe-80d2faa9ee7b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 276–284.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ordinary_supersingular_selects_policy_not_growth_theorem :
    (selectCompressionPolicy 5 1).selectedPolicy =
        PrimeReductionPolicy.ordinaryMacroPolicy ∧
      (selectCompressionPolicy 7 0).selectedPolicy =
        PrimeReductionPolicy.supersingularMacroPolicy ∧
      (selectCompressionPolicy 5 1).growthTheoremClaim = false ∧
      (selectCompressionPolicy 7 0).growthTheoremClaim = false := by
  native_decide

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/MacroCompression/Variant798954990535ee1d2951fb5014671c7bc4f23c93a3bcac048c03e0d19a687127.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/MacroCompression/Variant798954990535ee1d2951fb5014671c7bc4f23c93a3bcac048c03e0d19a687127.lean#L276).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `44afa7167ff32ae392c5e555f706a96a0bf3e1d9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
