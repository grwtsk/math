## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c92c4c312800122e191810e8fb7e4c80df094c17fea8a6a471d9af28faf0a4bc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–56.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class HasZeroMorphisms where
  /-- Every morphism space has zero -/
  [zero : ∀ X Y : C, Zero (X ⟶ Y)]
  /-- `f` composed with `0` is `0` -/
  comp_zero : ∀ {X Y : C} (f : X ⟶ Y) (Z : C), f ≫ (0 : Y ⟶ Z) = (0 : X ⟶ Z) := by aesop_cat
  /-- `0` composed with `f` is `0` -/
  zero_comp : ∀ (X : C) {Y Z : C} (f : Y ⟶ Z), (0 : X ⟶ Y) ≫ f = (0 : X ⟶ Z) := by aesop_cat

attribute [instance] HasZeroMorphisms.zero

variable {C}

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ZeroMorphisms/Variante27ccade7d8feabf6411eb61c86ec5431d08fd2e234ecaac88d5c3b2717a1547.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ZeroMorphisms/Variante27ccade7d8feabf6411eb61c86ec5431d08fd2e234ecaac88d5c3b2717a1547.lean#L44).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e8d5026f46ed2c1e355c98bf00946d629ca113d1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
