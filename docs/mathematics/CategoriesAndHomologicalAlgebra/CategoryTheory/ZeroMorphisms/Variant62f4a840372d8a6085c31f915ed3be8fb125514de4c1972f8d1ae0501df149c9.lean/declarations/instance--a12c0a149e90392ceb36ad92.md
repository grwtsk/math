## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:834c140fd1eb184ba70528c4bd58474e7edb78f1fb16b37c1947075a248b9572`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 608–617.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (b : β) : Mono (Pi.ι f b) where
  right_cancellation _ _ e := by simpa using congrArg (· ≫ Pi.π f b) e

end PiIota

section SigmaPi

variable [HasZeroMorphisms C] {β : Type w} [DecidableEq β] (f : β → C) [HasCoproduct f]

@[reassoc, grind =]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ZeroMorphisms/Variant62f4a840372d8a6085c31f915ed3be8fb125514de4c1972f8d1ae0501df149c9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ZeroMorphisms/Variant62f4a840372d8a6085c31f915ed3be8fb125514de4c1972f8d1ae0501df149c9.lean#L608).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c2539fbd7ad61c6ce766a31e2ca6b7fce6aa0bfe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
