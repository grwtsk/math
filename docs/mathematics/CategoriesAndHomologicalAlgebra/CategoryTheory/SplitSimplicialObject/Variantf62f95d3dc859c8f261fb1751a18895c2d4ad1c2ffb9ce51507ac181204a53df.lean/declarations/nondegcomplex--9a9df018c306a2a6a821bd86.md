## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:16ef9f91ef844a53e7b6e3d16404eb04f90dbf63fa75e117ff84e4312f7428f8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 150–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def nondegComplex : ChainComplex C ℕ where
  X := s.N
  d := s.d
  shape i j hij := by simp only [d, K[X].shape i j hij, zero_comp, comp_zero]
  d_comp_d' i j k _ _ := by
    simp only [d, assoc]
    have eq : K[X].d i j ≫ 𝟙 (X.obj (op ⦋j⦌)) ≫ K[X].d j k ≫
        s.πSummand (IndexSet.id (op ⦋k⦌)) = 0 := by
      simp

    rw [eq, comp_zero]

/-- The chain complex `s.nondegComplex` attached to a splitting of a simplicial object `X`
becomes isomorphic to the normalized Moore complex `N₁.obj X` defined as a formal direct
factor in the category `Karoubi (ChainComplex C ℕ)`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/SplitSimplicialObject/Variantf62f95d3dc859c8f261fb1751a18895c2d4ad1c2ffb9ce51507ac181204a53df.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/SplitSimplicialObject/Variantf62f95d3dc859c8f261fb1751a18895c2d4ad1c2ffb9ce51507ac181204a53df.lean#L150).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `09547c87adbffce2a3f8c9103149b27f8b2e3fa5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
