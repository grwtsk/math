## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b888bde9720d645145a805a34c10ce120a416a4689d53b2ede6c6bcaf65bcb25`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 228–235.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def isTerminalOfEqEmpty (F : X.Sheaf C) {U : Opens X} (h : U = ⊥) :
    Limits.IsTerminal (F.val.obj (op U)) := by
  convert F.isTerminalOfEmpty

/-- If a family `B` of open sets forms a basis of the topology on `X`, and if `F'`
    is a sheaf on `X`, then a homomorphism between a presheaf `F` on `X` and `F'`
    is equivalent to a homomorphism between their restrictions to the indexing type
    `ι` of `B`, with the induced category structure on `ι`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Sites/Variantff5a1f435ae870b6e6947d7b821fa855b0ef9f85cb25f927c9f51dde7436634a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Sites/Variantff5a1f435ae870b6e6947d7b821fa855b0ef9f85cb25f927c9f51dde7436634a.lean#L228).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6b49aa52317a45cf99ca16293c9a3a6f61501c96` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
