## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7d17859b-63c7-377f-71fe-703a9fba5df2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 93–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_grothendieckTopology :
    Sieve.generate (presieveOfCovering U) ∈ Opens.grothendieckTopology X (iSup U) := by
  intro x hx
  obtain ⟨i, hxi⟩ := Opens.mem_iSup.mp hx
  exact ⟨U i, Opens.leSupr U i, ⟨U i, 𝟙 _, Opens.leSupr U i, ⟨i, rfl⟩, Category.id_comp _⟩, hxi⟩

/-- An index `i : ι` can be turned into a dependent pair `(V, f)`, where `V` is an open set and
`f : V ⟶ iSup U` is a member of `presieveOfCovering U f`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Sites/Variant96994b76c85043ccb280619865ff2dcc9661371ac85386c0535aa1f0b5650c86.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Sites/Variant96994b76c85043ccb280619865ff2dcc9661371ac85386c0535aa1f0b5650c86.lean#L93).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c828e30220865331353d70f0807777dde8de9565` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
