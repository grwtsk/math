## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c50cde1c-4500-ada4-ba9d-eeac5589b546`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 328–338.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem AdditiveFunctor.ofExact_map {F G : C ⥤ₑ D} (α : F ⟶ G) :
    (AdditiveFunctor.ofExact C D).map α = α :=
  rfl
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false in
#align category_theory.Additive_Functor.of_exact_map CategoryTheory.AdditiveFunctor.ofExact_map

end Exact

end Preadditive

end CategoryTheory
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/AdditiveFunctor/Variant0d06fd91fa6aefb4f8a7274f37253193c9837a6a38b6c6bfeb74a890b0e4ba25.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/AdditiveFunctor/Variant0d06fd91fa6aefb4f8a7274f37253193c9837a6a38b6c6bfeb74a890b0e4ba25.lean#L328).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
