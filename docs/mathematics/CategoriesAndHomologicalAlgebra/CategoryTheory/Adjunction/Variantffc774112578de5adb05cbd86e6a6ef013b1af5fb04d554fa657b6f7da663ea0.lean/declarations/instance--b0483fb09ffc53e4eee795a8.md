## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b549b67f7bb95cb4256e1b8014b3e31b3d564e691e18dc0447067b1cda7987da`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 581–593.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : (E.trans E').CommShift A :=
  inferInstanceAs ((E.toAdjunction.comp E'.toAdjunction).CommShift A)

end CommShift

end

variable (A : Type*) [AddGroup A] [HasShift C A] [HasShift D A]

/--
If `E : C ≌ D` is an equivalence and we have a `CommShift` structure on `E.functor`,
this constructs the unique compatible `CommShift` structure on `E.inverse`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Adjunction/Variantffc774112578de5adb05cbd86e6a6ef013b1af5fb04d554fa657b6f7da663ea0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Adjunction/Variantffc774112578de5adb05cbd86e6a6ef013b1af5fb04d554fa657b6f7da663ea0.lean#L581).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6dc822ffe537245acf22e03b89b52f1b2f16b85b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
