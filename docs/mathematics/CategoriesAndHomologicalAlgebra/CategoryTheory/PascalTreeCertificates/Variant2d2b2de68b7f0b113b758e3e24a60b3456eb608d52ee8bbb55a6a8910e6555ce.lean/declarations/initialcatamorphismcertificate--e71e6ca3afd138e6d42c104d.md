## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3781d0d8d2e676b3911acce2a38386a4fd28c8602f9c5069ecde4f674b978895`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 832–845.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure InitialCatamorphismCertificate {Leaf Label : Type u}
    (A : Algebra.{u, w} Leaf Label) where
  catamorphism : PascalTree Leaf Label → A.Carrier
  leafLaw : ∀ x, catamorphism (leaf x) = A.onLeaf x
  nodeLaw : ∀ label coeff l r,
    catamorphism (node label coeff l r) =
      A.onNode label coeff (catamorphism l) (catamorphism r)
  unique : ∀ g : PascalTree Leaf Label → A.Carrier,
    (∀ x, g (leaf x) = A.onLeaf x) →
    (∀ label coeff l r,
      g (node label coeff l r) = A.onNode label coeff (g l) (g r)) →
        g = catamorphism
  certificateBoundary : ClaimBoundary

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/PascalTreeCertificates/Variant2d2b2de68b7f0b113b758e3e24a60b3456eb608d52ee8bbb55a6a8910e6555ce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/PascalTreeCertificates/Variant2d2b2de68b7f0b113b758e3e24a60b3456eb608d52ee8bbb55a6a8910e6555ce.lean#L832).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b1f7516b2f852be84b0b23e71bbb1e534faf7105` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
