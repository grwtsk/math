## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9e1e1a1a-58fc-57b8-572b-c7ec5d1ca573`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 78–88.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Preadditive.epi_iff_surjective' {X Y : C} (f : X ⟶ Y) :
    Epi f ↔ Function.Surjective f := by
  simp only [epi_iff_surjective, ← CategoryTheory.epi_iff_surjective]
  apply (MorphismProperty.epimorphisms (Type w)).arrow_mk_iso_iff
  have e : forget₂ C Ab ⋙ forget Ab ≅ forget C := eqToIso (HasForget₂.forget_comp)
  exact Arrow.isoOfNatIso e (Arrow.mk f)

end

namespace ShortComplex

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ConcreteCategory/Variant8d9547189f334ba05d328a9ca8c4534ccca65fb7cf5f45adb66bbcfa24fb79e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ConcreteCategory/Variant8d9547189f334ba05d328a9ca8c4534ccca65fb7cf5f45adb66bbcfa24fb79e7.lean#L78).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5cba0cfe271fef79fcd3aff0edf9f0376dc4a46d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
