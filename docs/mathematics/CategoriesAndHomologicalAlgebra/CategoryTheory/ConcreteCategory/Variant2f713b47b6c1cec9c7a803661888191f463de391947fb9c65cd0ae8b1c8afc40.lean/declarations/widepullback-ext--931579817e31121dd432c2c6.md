## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3ba26053-d3d7-4d9a-e7c1-67c2622e8183`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 243–251.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem widePullback_ext {B : C} {ι : Type w} {X : ι → C} (f : ∀ j : ι, X j ⟶ B)
    [HasWidePullback B X f] [PreservesLimit (wideCospan B X f) (forget C)]
    (x y : ToType (widePullback B X f)) (h₀ : base f x = base f y) (h : ∀ j, π f j x = π f j y) :
    x = y := by
  apply Concrete.limit_ext
  rintro (_ | j)
  · exact h₀
  · apply h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ConcreteCategory/Variant2f713b47b6c1cec9c7a803661888191f463de391947fb9c65cd0ae8b1c8afc40.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ConcreteCategory/Variant2f713b47b6c1cec9c7a803661888191f463de391947fb9c65cd0ae8b1c8afc40.lean#L243).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `21d8038fe67cffcd4bf87bcb16dfef1ec0219f1a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
