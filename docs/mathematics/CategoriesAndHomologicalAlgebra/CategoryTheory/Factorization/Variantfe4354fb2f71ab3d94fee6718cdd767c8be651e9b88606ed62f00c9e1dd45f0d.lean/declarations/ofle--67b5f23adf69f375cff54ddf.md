## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4bebe443e7bca6b0d1900e4e78df77023a5b29e700cc42626c3388ee9587b318`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 152–161.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofLE {W₁' W₂' : MorphismProperty C} (le₁ : W₁ ≤ W₁') (le₂ : W₂ ≤ W₂') :
    FunctorialFactorizationData W₁' W₂' where
  Z := data.Z
  i := data.i
  p := data.p
  hi f := le₁ _ (data.hi f)
  hp f := le₂ _ (data.hp f)

set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false in
/-- The term in `FactorizationData W₁ W₂` that is deduced from a functorial factorization. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Factorization/Variantfe4354fb2f71ab3d94fee6718cdd767c8be651e9b88606ed62f00c9e1dd45f0d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Factorization/Variantfe4354fb2f71ab3d94fee6718cdd767c8be651e9b88606ed62f00c9e1dd45f0d.lean#L152).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f1ed95daaf34c93688da13ec7e85141923049b1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
