## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ac2006027ae937c716cc7a7932def72cacce43dadbd6caa12baf5b6cadcebe7a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 245–259.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def functorCategory :
    FunctorialFactorizationData (W₁.functorCategory J) (W₂.functorCategory J) where
  Z := functorCategory.Z data J
  i := { app := fun f => { app := fun j => (data.factorizationData (f.hom.app j)).i } }
  p := { app := fun f => { app := fun j => (data.factorizationData (f.hom.app j)).p } }
  hi _ _ := data.hi _
  hp _ _ := data.hp _

end

end FunctorialFactorizationData

/-- The functorial factorization axiom for two classes of morphisms `W₁` and `W₂` in a
category `C`. It asserts that any morphism can be factored in a functorial manner
as a morphism in `W₁` followed by a morphism in `W₂`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Factorization/Variantfe4354fb2f71ab3d94fee6718cdd767c8be651e9b88606ed62f00c9e1dd45f0d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Factorization/Variantfe4354fb2f71ab3d94fee6718cdd767c8be651e9b88606ed62f00c9e1dd45f0d.lean#L245).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f1ed95daaf34c93688da13ec7e85141923049b1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
