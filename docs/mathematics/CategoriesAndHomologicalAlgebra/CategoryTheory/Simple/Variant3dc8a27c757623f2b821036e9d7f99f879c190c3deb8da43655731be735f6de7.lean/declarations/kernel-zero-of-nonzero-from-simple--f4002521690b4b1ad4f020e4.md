## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:734db9aa-4925-b03b-0a71-4149f242b585`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 85–95.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem kernel_zero_of_nonzero_from_simple {X Y : C} [Simple X] {f : X ⟶ Y} [HasKernel f]
    (w : f ≠ 0) : kernel.ι f = 0 := by
  classical
    by_contra h
    haveI := isIso_of_mono_of_nonzero h
    exact w (eq_zero_of_epi_kernel f)

-- See also `mono_of_nonzero_from_simple`, which requires `Preadditive C`.
/-- A nonzero morphism `f` to a simple object is an epimorphism
(assuming `f` has an image, and `C` has equalizers).

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Simple/Variant3dc8a27c757623f2b821036e9d7f99f879c190c3deb8da43655731be735f6de7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Simple/Variant3dc8a27c757623f2b821036e9d7f99f879c190c3deb8da43655731be735f6de7.lean#L85).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0619c135844fcdae76096067ef608f49086f8932` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
