## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3243d2c3-7e22-36b5-60da-fe4c857d5afb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 429–444.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma presheaf_monomorphisms_le_monomorphisms :
    (monomorphisms C).presheaf ≤ monomorphisms _ := fun F G f hf ↦ by
  suffices ∀ {X : C} {a b : yoneda.obj X ⟶ F}, a ≫ f = b ≫ f → a = b from
    ⟨fun _ _ h ↦ hom_ext_yoneda (fun _ _ ↦ this (by simp only [assoc, h]))⟩
  intro X a b h
  /- It suffices to show that the lifts of `a` and `b` to morphisms
  `X ⟶ hf.rep.pullback g` are equal, where `g = a ≫ f = a ≫ f`. -/
  suffices hf.rep.lift (g := a ≫ f) a (𝟙 X) (by simp) =
      hf.rep.lift b (𝟙 X) (by simp [← h]) by
    simpa using yoneda.congr_map this =≫ (hf.rep.fst (a ≫ f))
  -- This follows from the fact that the induced maps `hf.rep.pullback g ⟶ X` are mono.
  have : Mono (hf.rep.snd (a ≫ f)) := hf.property_snd (a ≫ f)
  simp only [← cancel_mono (hf.rep.snd (a ≫ f)), lift_snd]

variable {G : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ Type v₁}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Representable/Variant1a7e9a5db2f7700dae268d8c4ce63c43c23acd6969e52cc9cf43330df3648e58.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Representable/Variant1a7e9a5db2f7700dae268d8c4ce63c43c23acd6969e52cc9cf43330df3648e58.lean#L429).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cc4f6e3f318a62359e36fbfaecb6e48a2e54780b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
