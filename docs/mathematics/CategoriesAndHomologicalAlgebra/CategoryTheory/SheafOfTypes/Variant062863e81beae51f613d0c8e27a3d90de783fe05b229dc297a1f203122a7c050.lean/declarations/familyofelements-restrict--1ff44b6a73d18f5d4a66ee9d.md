## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0cf949a764a7365fd8ce933a4da180528e4f0ba024669819a3b9682b71bdd839`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 132–146.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def FamilyOfElements.restrict {R₁ R₂ : Presieve X} (h : R₁ ≤ R₂) :
    FamilyOfElements P R₂ → FamilyOfElements P R₁ := fun x _ f hf => x f (h _ hf)
#align category_theory.presieve.family_of_elements.restrict CategoryTheory.Presieve.FamilyOfElements.restrict

/-- A family of elements for the arrow set `R` is *compatible* if for any `f₁ : Y₁ ⟶ X` and
`f₂ : Y₂ ⟶ X` in `R`, and any `g₁ : Z ⟶ Y₁` and `g₂ : Z ⟶ Y₂`, if the square `g₁ ≫ f₁ = g₂ ≫ f₂`
commutes then the elements of `P Z` obtained by restricting the element of `P Y₁` along `g₁` and
restricting the element of `P Y₂` along `g₂` are the same.

In special cases, this condition can be simplified, see `pullbackCompatible_iff` and
`compatible_iff_sieveCompatible`.

This is referred to as a "compatible family" in Definition C2.1.2 of [Elephant], and on nlab:

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/SheafOfTypes/Variant062863e81beae51f613d0c8e27a3d90de783fe05b229dc297a1f203122a7c050.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/SheafOfTypes/Variant062863e81beae51f613d0c8e27a3d90de783fe05b229dc297a1f203122a7c050.lean#L132).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `268f9c1f5276189c603b1987bfa1cb0111258b2b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
