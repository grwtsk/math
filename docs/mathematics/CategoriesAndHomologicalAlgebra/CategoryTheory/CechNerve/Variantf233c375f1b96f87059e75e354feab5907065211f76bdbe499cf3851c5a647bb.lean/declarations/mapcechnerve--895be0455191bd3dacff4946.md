## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b4d6ed556a0a3e22a900ad4a4fe30627a8c7619911b3f43e69b2ab8fec89f1be`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–84.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mapCechNerve {f g : Arrow C}
    [∀ n : ℕ, HasWidePullback f.right (fun _ : Fin (n + 1) => f.left) fun _ => f.hom]
    [∀ n : ℕ, HasWidePullback g.right (fun _ : Fin (n + 1) => g.left) fun _ => g.hom] (F : f ⟶ g) :
    f.cechNerve ⟶ g.cechNerve where
  app n :=
    WidePullback.lift (WidePullback.base _ ≫ F.right) (fun i => WidePullback.π _ i ≫ F.left)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CechNerve/Variantf233c375f1b96f87059e75e354feab5907065211f76bdbe499cf3851c5a647bb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CechNerve/Variantf233c375f1b96f87059e75e354feab5907065211f76bdbe499cf3851c5a647bb.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `be6dc8134b474b9cd38f09581d6718655c59bcdd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
