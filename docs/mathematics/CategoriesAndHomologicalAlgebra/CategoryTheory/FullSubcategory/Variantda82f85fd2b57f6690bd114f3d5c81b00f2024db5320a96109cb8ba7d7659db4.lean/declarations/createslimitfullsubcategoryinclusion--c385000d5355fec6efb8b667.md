## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b5f8cf9238668d80bad9a0c065deeb62eca597a7616577cbd0ce4e11254ba78a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 72–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def createsLimitFullSubcategoryInclusion' (F : J ⥤ FullSubcategory P)
    {c : Cone (F ⋙ fullSubcategoryInclusion P)} (hc : IsLimit c) (h : P c.pt) :
    CreatesLimit F (fullSubcategoryInclusion P) :=
  createsLimitOfFullyFaithfulOfIso' hc ⟨_, h⟩ (Iso.refl _)
#align category_theory.limits.creates_limit_full_subcategory_inclusion' CategoryTheory.Limits.createsLimitFullSubcategoryInclusion'

/-- If a `J`-shaped diagram in `FullSubcategory P` has a limit in `C` whose cone point lives in the
    full subcategory, then this defines a limit in the full subcategory. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FullSubcategory/Variantda82f85fd2b57f6690bd114f3d5c81b00f2024db5320a96109cb8ba7d7659db4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FullSubcategory/Variantda82f85fd2b57f6690bd114f3d5c81b00f2024db5320a96109cb8ba7d7659db4.lean#L72).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `718637b3e08b0181514ab6bb8183a82bce4f33dc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
