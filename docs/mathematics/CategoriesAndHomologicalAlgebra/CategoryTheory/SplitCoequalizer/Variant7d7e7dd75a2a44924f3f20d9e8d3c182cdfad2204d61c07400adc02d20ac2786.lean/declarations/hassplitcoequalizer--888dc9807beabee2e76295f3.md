## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0fa042b4f3418d1ba05e570f3de1d5a44cdb67a805b3c129b956547a48a65049`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 142–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class HasSplitCoequalizer : Prop where
  /-- There is some split coequalizer -/
  splittable : ∃ (Z : C) (h : Y ⟶ Z), Nonempty (IsSplitCoequalizer f g h)
#align category_theory.has_split_coequalizer CategoryTheory.HasSplitCoequalizer

/--
The pair `f,g` is a `G`-split pair if there is an `h : G Y ⟶ Z` so that `G f, G g, h` forms a split
coequalizer in `D`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/SplitCoequalizer/Variant7d7e7dd75a2a44924f3f20d9e8d3c182cdfad2204d61c07400adc02d20ac2786.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/SplitCoequalizer/Variant7d7e7dd75a2a44924f3f20d9e8d3c182cdfad2204d61c07400adc02d20ac2786.lean#L142).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `45797185025442dd1ae34ad50dd07694dbbb1659` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
