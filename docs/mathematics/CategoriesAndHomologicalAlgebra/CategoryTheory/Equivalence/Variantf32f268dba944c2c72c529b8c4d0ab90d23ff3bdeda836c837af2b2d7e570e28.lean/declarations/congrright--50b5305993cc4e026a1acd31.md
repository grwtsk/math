## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d266f02192609bb50a1226be68ee16dfbb7c0fc8dd45a574fa92eaed705de8be`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 420–430.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def congrRight (e : C ≌ D) : E ⥤ C ≌ E ⥤ D where
  functor := (whiskeringRight _ _ _).obj e.functor
  inverse := (whiskeringRight _ _ _).obj e.inverse
  unitIso := NatIso.ofComponents
      fun F => F.rightUnitor.symm ≪≫ isoWhiskerLeft F e.unitIso ≪≫ Functor.associator _ _ _

variable (E) in

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Equivalence/Variantf32f268dba944c2c72c529b8c4d0ab90d23ff3bdeda836c837af2b2d7e570e28.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Equivalence/Variantf32f268dba944c2c72c529b8c4d0ab90d23ff3bdeda836c837af2b2d7e570e28.lean#L420).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4d61a0fbe9732519fd0a9f6bf1ac240aaaf9a079` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
