## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f309a427d1af70155faefafbcc53408095a5cf81d4f721048c2eb889cee742b4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 74–85.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev HasGoodTrifunctor₁₂Obj :=
  GradedObject.HasGoodTrifunctor₁₂Obj F₁₂ G
    (ComplexShape.ρ₁₂ c₁ c₂ c₃ c₁₂ c₄) K₁.X K₂.X K₃.X

variable (F G₂₃) in
/-- Given bifunctors `F : C₁ ⥤ C₂₃ ⥤ C₄`, `G₂₃ : C₂ ⥤ C₃ ⥤ C₂₃`, homological complexes
`K₁ : HomologicalComplex C₁ c₁`, `K₂ : HomologicalComplex C₂ c₂` and
`K₃ : HomologicalComplex C₃ c₃`, and complexes shapes `c₁₂`, `c₂₃`, `c₄`
with `ComplexShape.Associative c₁ c₂ c₃ c₁₂ c₂₃ c₄`, this asserts that for
all `i₁ : ι₁` and `i₂₃ : ι₂₃`, the functor `F(K₁.X i₁, _)` commutes with
the coproducts of the `G₂₃(K₂.X i₂, K₃.X i₃)`
such that `π c₂ c₃ c₂₃ ⟨i₂, i₃⟩ = i₂₃`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BifunctorAssociator/Variantb33ac3c71d9c624ca97504d33fb58abea67d21754f82ba0576ded65517696692.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/BifunctorAssociator/Variantb33ac3c71d9c624ca97504d33fb58abea67d21754f82ba0576ded65517696692.lean#L74).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1780d7ba29fdcbdb3cc7d7ff78d712623dab24e9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
