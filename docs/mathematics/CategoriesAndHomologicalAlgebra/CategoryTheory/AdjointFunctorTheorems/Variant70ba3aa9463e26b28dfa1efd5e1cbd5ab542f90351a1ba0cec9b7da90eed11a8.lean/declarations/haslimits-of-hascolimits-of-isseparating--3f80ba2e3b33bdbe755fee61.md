## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:526b8946-2c4d-29ca-af28-b8bda10a6683`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 142–149.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasLimits_of_hasColimits_of_isSeparating [HasColimits C] [WellPowered.{v} Cᵒᵖ] {𝒢 : Set C}
    [Small.{v} 𝒢] (h𝒢 : IsSeparating 𝒢) : HasLimits C :=
  { has_limits_of_shape := fun _ _ =>
      hasLimitsOfShape_iff_isLeftAdjoint_const.2
        (isLeftAdjoint_of_preservesColimits_of_isSeparating h𝒢 _) }

/-- A consequence of the special adjoint functor theorem: if `C` is complete, well-powered and
    has a separator, then it is complete. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/AdjointFunctorTheorems/Variant70ba3aa9463e26b28dfa1efd5e1cbd5ab542f90351a1ba0cec9b7da90eed11a8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/AdjointFunctorTheorems/Variant70ba3aa9463e26b28dfa1efd5e1cbd5ab542f90351a1ba0cec9b7da90eed11a8.lean#L142).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ed1385e643991393eb5b7d5238a672ec4d6b016` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
