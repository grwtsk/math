## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d25a17ad-bf76-a427-30a3-9546245d538c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 141–181.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

We roughly follow the construction given in [MR0302656]. Given a pair `f, g : X ⟶ Y` of morphisms
of locally ringed spaces, we want to show that the stalk map of
`π = coequalizer.π f g` (as sheafed space homs) is a local ring hom. It then follows that
`coequalizer f g` is indeed a locally ringed space, and `coequalizer.π f g` is a morphism of
locally ringed space.

Given a germ `⟨U, s⟩` of `x : coequalizer f g` such that `π꙳ x : Y` is invertible, we ought to show
that `⟨U, s⟩` is invertible. That is, there exists an open set `U' ⊆ U` containing `x` such that the
restriction of `s` onto `U'` is invertible. This `U'` is given by `π '' V`, where `V` is the
basic open set of `π⋆x`.

Since `f ⁻¹' V = Y.basic_open (f ≫ π)꙳ x = Y.basic_open (g ≫ π)꙳ x = g ⁻¹' V`, we have
`π ⁻¹' π '' V = V` (as the underlying set map is merely the set-theoretic coequalizer).
This shows that `π '' V` is indeed open, and `s` is invertible on `π '' V` as the components of `π꙳`
are local ring homs.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HasColimits/Variant014892d5d6999270971defb92116ffe6ef858f2964c36fc654634842d041ec32.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HasColimits/Variant014892d5d6999270971defb92116ffe6ef858f2964c36fc654634842d041ec32.lean#L141).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
