## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f607fc2f-6bb6-e50a-809c-3d0f6c8a691b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 388–401.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Topology.IsOpenEmbedding.functor_obj_iInf {X Y : TopCat.{u}} (f : X ⟶ Y)
    (hf : Topology.IsOpenEmbedding f) {ι : Type*} [Nonempty ι] [Finite ι]
    (g : ι → TopologicalSpace.Opens X) :
    hf.functor.obj (⨅ i, g i) = ⨅ i, hf.functor.obj (g i) := by
  ext : 1
  simp only [IsOpenMap.coe_functor_obj, TopologicalSpace.Opens.coe_iInf]

  exact hf.injective.injOn

namespace Topology.IsInducing

/-- Given an inducing map `X ⟶ Y` and some `U : Opens X`, this is the union of all open sets
whose preimage is `U`. This is right adjoint to `Opens.map`. -/
@[nolint unusedArguments]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Opens/Varianta1a7977c66525c8eab25d4adf11bcb9914237d57c8cd9af7896571445adee333.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Opens/Varianta1a7977c66525c8eab25d4adf11bcb9914237d57c8cd9af7896571445adee333.lean#L388).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fe47859bf7e4f539668937dc4436be28ce7c87aa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
