## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b039ac1d-4bbf-0dd4-9bf0-bab8a2c1e659`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 198–209.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsConnected.of_induct {j₀ : J}
    (h : ∀ p : Set J, j₀ ∈ p → (∀ {j₁ j₂ : J} (_ : j₁ ⟶ j₂), j₁ ∈ p ↔ j₂ ∈ p) → ∀ j : J, j ∈ p) :
    IsConnected J :=
  have := Nonempty.intro j₀
  IsConnected.of_constant_of_preserves_morphisms fun {α} F a => by
    have w := h { j | F j = F j₀ } rfl (fun {j₁} {j₂} f => by
      change F j₁ = F j₀ ↔ F j₂ = F j₀
      simp [a f])
    intro j j'
    rw [w j, w j']

/-- Lifting the universe level of morphisms and objects preserves connectedness. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsConnected/Variantfb9f51c7ab2a356063037c6745a0e4eec799bddefecc6f32e2b3f5426420bbd1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsConnected/Variantfb9f51c7ab2a356063037c6745a0e4eec799bddefecc6f32e2b3f5426420bbd1.lean#L198).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1d0b6356e13ba451d6dcffde5372eb24266f587d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
