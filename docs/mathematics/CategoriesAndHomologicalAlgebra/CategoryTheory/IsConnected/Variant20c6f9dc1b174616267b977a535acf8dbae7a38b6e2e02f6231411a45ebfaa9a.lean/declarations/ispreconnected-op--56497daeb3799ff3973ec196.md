## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dd617d89304fd162ccaaab4df5cb3535000e4e854fcb4df5790df781b8459bef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 243–251.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isPreconnected_op [IsPreconnected J] : IsPreconnected Jᵒᵖ where
  iso_constant := fun {α} F X =>
    ⟨NatIso.ofComponents fun Y =>
      eqToIso (Discrete.ext _ _ (Discrete.eq_of_hom ((Nonempty.some
        (IsPreconnected.iso_constant (F.rightOp ⋙ (Discrete.opposite α).functor) (unop X))).app
          (unop Y)).hom))⟩
#align category_theory.is_preconnected_op CategoryTheory.isPreconnected_op

/-- If `J` is connected, then `Jᵒᵖ` is connected as well. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsConnected/Variant20c6f9dc1b174616267b977a535acf8dbae7a38b6e2e02f6231411a45ebfaa9a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsConnected/Variant20c6f9dc1b174616267b977a535acf8dbae7a38b6e2e02f6231411a45ebfaa9a.lean#L243).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `30cfa82be70523ff568e1f082bc52d0c9d452c84` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
