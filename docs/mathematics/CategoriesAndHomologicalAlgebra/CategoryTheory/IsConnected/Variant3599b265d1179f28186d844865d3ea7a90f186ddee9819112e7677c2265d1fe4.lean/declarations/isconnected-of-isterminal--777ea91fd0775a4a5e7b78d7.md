## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d4a5c427-c060-2a63-fdb4-f183b0c362b6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 163–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isConnected_of_isTerminal {x : C} (h : Limits.IsTerminal x) : IsConnected C := by
  letI : Nonempty C := ⟨x⟩
  apply isConnected_of_zigzag
  intro j₁ j₂
  use [x, j₂]
  simp only [List.chain_cons, List.Chain.nil, and_true, ne_eq, reduceCtorEq, not_false_eq_true,
    List.getLast_cons, List.cons_ne_self, List.getLast_singleton]
  exact ⟨Zag.of_hom <| h.from _, Zag.symm <| Zag.of_hom <| h.from _⟩

-- note : it seems making the following two as instances breaks things, so these are lemmas.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsConnected/Variant3599b265d1179f28186d844865d3ea7a90f186ddee9819112e7677c2265d1fe4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsConnected/Variant3599b265d1179f28186d844865d3ea7a90f186ddee9819112e7677c2265d1fe4.lean#L163).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `50f620121744050f07fd045ae033372c3d717f66` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
