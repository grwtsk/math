## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4d709129f66f6fd79bf9f41d2628bae9ca226415acd8f9708d21d21de40846e7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 372–385.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def discreteIsConnectedEquivPUnit {α : Type u₁} [IsConnected (Discrete α)] : α ≃ PUnit :=
  Discrete.equivOfEquivalence.{u₁, u₁}
    { functor := Functor.star (Discrete α)
      inverse := Discrete.functor fun _ => Classical.arbitrary _
      unitIso := isoConstant _ (Classical.arbitrary _)
      counitIso := Functor.punitExt _ _ }
#align category_theory.discrete_is_connected_equiv_punit CategoryTheory.discreteIsConnectedEquivPUnit

variable {C : Type u₂} [Category.{u₁} C]

/-- For objects `X Y : C`, any natural transformation `α : const X ⟶ const Y` from a connected
category must be constant.
This is the key property of connected categories which we use to establish properties about limits.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsConnected/Variant1c8460c209235819cf0c63d76b772eeb3eac73fa867c4d86646e994dd8498beb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsConnected/Variant1c8460c209235819cf0c63d76b772eeb3eac73fa867c4d86646e994dd8498beb.lean#L372).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `be77a69f088bbef1907ab5ed6bd6da4ea01e60dd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
