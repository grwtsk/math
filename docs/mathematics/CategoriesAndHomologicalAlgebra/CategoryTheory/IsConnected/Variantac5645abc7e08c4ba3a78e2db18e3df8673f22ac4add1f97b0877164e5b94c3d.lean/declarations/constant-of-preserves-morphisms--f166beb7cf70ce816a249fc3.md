## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:27a83ac0-6e5c-eefd-df57-ec8d3a64396f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 172–182.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem constant_of_preserves_morphisms' [IsConnected J] {α : Type u₂} (F : J → α)
    (h : ∀ (j₁ j₂ : J) (_ : j₁ ⟶ j₂), F j₁ = F j₂) :
    ∃ (a : α), ∀ (j : J), F j = a :=
  ⟨F (Classical.arbitrary _), fun _ ↦ constant_of_preserves_morphisms _ h _ _⟩

/-- `J` is connected if: given any function `F : J → α` which is constant for any
`j₁, j₂` for which there is a morphism `j₁ ⟶ j₂`, then `F` is constant.
This can be thought of as a local-to-global property.

The converse of `constant_of_preserves_morphisms`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsConnected/Variantac5645abc7e08c4ba3a78e2db18e3df8673f22ac4add1f97b0877164e5b94c3d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsConnected/Variantac5645abc7e08c4ba3a78e2db18e3df8673f22ac4add1f97b0877164e5b94c3d.lean#L172).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4fac763b747315e3ade4f00adc15ce0d7d1424c6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
