## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:30870a7adcb16645b910687d5895610ac776b40007a5800ad9d27f884d905be3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 184–194.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def coconeOfCoconeCurry {D : DiagramOfCocones (curry.obj G)} (Q : ∀ j, IsColimit (D.obj j))
    (c : Cocone G) : Cocone D.coconePoints where
  pt := c.pt
  ι :=
    { app j := (Q j).desc
        { pt := c.pt
          ι := { app k := c.ι.app (j, k) } }
      naturality {j _} _ := (Q j).hom_ext (by simp) }

/-- `coneOfConeUncurry Q c` is a limit cone when `c` is a limit cone.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Fubini/Variantbf20d86f0c13d83211179c4e68b8a2109a2304d063f747a6dbe5b321766fe159.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Fubini/Variantbf20d86f0c13d83211179c4e68b8a2109a2304d063f747a6dbe5b321766fe159.lean#L184).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `939ceb4c1d9088653e2199fab5a7241a98fce3c2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
