## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5cce9470af29364a846ff461e3b4d6a898cfe183e777ce4cb3fcfc13418594ba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 41–48.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def cokerToKer' (hk : k ≤ n) (cc : CokernelCofork (S.map' k (k + 1)))
    (kf : KernelFork (S.map' (k + 2) (k + 3))) (hcc : IsColimit cc) (hkf : IsLimit kf) :
    cc.pt ⟶ kf.pt :=
  IsColimit.desc hcc (CokernelCofork.ofπ _
    (show S.map' k (k + 1) ≫ IsLimit.lift hkf (KernelFork.ofι _ (hS.zero (k + 1))) = _ from
      Fork.IsLimit.hom_ext hkf (by simpa using hS.zero k)))

@[reassoc (attr := simp)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ExactSequenceFour/Variant4cb6b87f02369fa9d88efc13e503cc8f979aede125d5bd11b6a4a7a08433d599.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ExactSequenceFour/Variant4cb6b87f02369fa9d88efc13e503cc8f979aede125d5bd11b6a4a7a08433d599.lean#L41).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a163200cb1cc8c5525853eb0abf1ae0f17841d8a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
