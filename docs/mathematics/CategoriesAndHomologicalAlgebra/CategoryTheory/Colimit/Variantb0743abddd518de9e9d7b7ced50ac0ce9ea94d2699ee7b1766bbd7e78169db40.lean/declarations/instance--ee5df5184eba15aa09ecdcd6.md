## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2361a33a4d1296115c6bf43ed4b7f055a7f383ead236729f4ec891c16c954dab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 218–225.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance (X : Profinite) [Finite X] :
    PreservesLimitsOfShape (Discrete X) F :=
  let X' := (Countable.toSmall.{0} X).equiv_small.choose
  let e : X ≃ X' := (Countable.toSmall X).equiv_small.choose_spec.some
  have : Finite X' := .of_equiv X e
  preservesLimitsOfShape_of_equiv (Discrete.equivalence e.symm) F

/-- Auxiliary definition for `isoFinYoneda`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Colimit/Variantb0743abddd518de9e9d7b7ced50ac0ce9ea94d2699ee7b1766bbd7e78169db40.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Colimit/Variantb0743abddd518de9e9d7b7ced50ac0ce9ea94d2699ee7b1766bbd7e78169db40.lean#L218).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `33120a7e118f4eb873b9eb5976c1c5ecb9ab4594` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
