## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:465c7132-019e-3443-2a30-9f84a9120cde`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 255–262.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma natTrans_ext {F G : Quotient r ⥤ D} (τ₁ τ₂ : F ⟶ G)
    (h : whiskerLeft (Quotient.functor r) τ₁ = whiskerLeft (Quotient.functor r) τ₂) : τ₁ = τ₂ :=
  NatTrans.ext (by ext1 ⟨X⟩; exact NatTrans.congr_app h X)

variable (r)

/-- In order to define a natural transformation `F ⟶ G` with `F G : Quotient r ⥤ D`, it suffices
to do so after precomposing with `Quotient.functor r`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Quotient/Variant224bcc0cc73965c77060d118873ad13786cb54b3b2886e532d3466d76cac20f4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Quotient/Variant224bcc0cc73965c77060d118873ad13786cb54b3b2886e532d3466d76cac20f4.lean#L255).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `67f783c12bc18f3f801725f8ba52250dfcadead1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
