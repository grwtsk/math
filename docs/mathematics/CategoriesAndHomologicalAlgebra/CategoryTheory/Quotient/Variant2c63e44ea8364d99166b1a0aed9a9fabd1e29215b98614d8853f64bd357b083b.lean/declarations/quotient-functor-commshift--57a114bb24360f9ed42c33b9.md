## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7cdf3f549c2f22c516b5d252e78c6ee128e4ae57f7e78e6651919c56b43105ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 53–69.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance Quotient.functor_commShift [r.IsCompatibleWithShift A] :
    (Quotient.functor r).CommShift A :=
  Functor.CommShift.ofInduced _ _ _ _

-- the construction is made irreducible in order to prevent timeouts and abuse of defeq
attribute [irreducible] HasShift.quotient Quotient.functor_commShift

namespace Quotient

variable [r.IsCompatibleWithShift A] [F.CommShift A]
    (hF : ∀ (x y : C) (f₁ f₂ : x ⟶ y), r f₁ f₂ → F.map f₁ = F.map f₂)

namespace LiftCommShift

variable {A}

/-- Auxiliary definition for `Quotient.liftCommShift`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Quotient/Variant2c63e44ea8364d99166b1a0aed9a9fabd1e29215b98614d8853f64bd357b083b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Quotient/Variant2c63e44ea8364d99166b1a0aed9a9fabd1e29215b98614d8853f64bd357b083b.lean#L53).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ea668302cc4c4e943bc6b6d143e5fbc410714a9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
