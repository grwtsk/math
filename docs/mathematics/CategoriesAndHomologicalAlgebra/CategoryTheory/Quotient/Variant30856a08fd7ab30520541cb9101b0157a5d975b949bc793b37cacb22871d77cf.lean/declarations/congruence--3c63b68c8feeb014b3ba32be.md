## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1253dad7fd3469063ecd95e2be51f3ae9f97724d98a9c25218e68883632c640f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 46–58.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class Congruence : Prop where
  /-- `r` is an equivalence on every hom-set. -/
  isEquiv : ∀ {X Y}, IsEquiv _ (@r X Y)
  /-- Precomposition with an arrow respects `r`. -/
  compLeft : ∀ {X Y Z} (f : X ⟶ Y) {g g' : Y ⟶ Z}, r g g' → r (f ≫ g) (f ≫ g')
  /-- Postcomposition with an arrow respects `r`. -/
  compRight : ∀ {X Y Z} {f f' : X ⟶ Y} (g : Y ⟶ Z), r f f' → r (f ≫ g) (f' ≫ g)
#align category_theory.congruence CategoryTheory.Congruence

attribute [instance] Congruence.isEquiv

/-- A type synonym for `C`, thought of as the objects of the quotient category. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Quotient/Variant30856a08fd7ab30520541cb9101b0157a5d975b949bc793b37cacb22871d77cf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Quotient/Variant30856a08fd7ab30520541cb9101b0157a5d975b949bc793b37cacb22871d77cf.lean#L46).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c15a09428338e7e8105ad5b46cca0845daed330` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
