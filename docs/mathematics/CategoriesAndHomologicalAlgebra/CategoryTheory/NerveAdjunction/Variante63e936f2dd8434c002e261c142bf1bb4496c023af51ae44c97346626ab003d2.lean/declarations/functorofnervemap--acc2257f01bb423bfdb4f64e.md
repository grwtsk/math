## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:530113dab038cd310acf12c09ee0ad39ff4ed1f5400e63f99968ceb9ed0424eb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 345–355.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def functorOfNerveMap (φ : nerveFunctor₂.obj ↧C ⟶ nerveFunctor₂.obj ↧D) :
    C ⥤ D where
  obj x := nerveEquiv (φ.app (op ⟨⦋0⦌, by simp⟩) (nerveEquiv.symm x))
  map f := nerve.homEquiv ((nerve.edgeMk f).toTruncated.map φ)
  map_id x := by
    rw [edgeMk_id, SSet.Edge.toTruncated_id, SSet.Truncated.Edge.map_id]
    exact nerve.homEquiv_id _
  map_comp f g := by
    obtain ⟨h⟩ := (nerve.nonempty_compStruct_iff f g (f ≫ g)).2 rfl
    exact (nerve.homEquiv_comp (h.toTruncated.map φ)).symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NerveAdjunction/Variante63e936f2dd8434c002e261c142bf1bb4496c023af51ae44c97346626ab003d2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NerveAdjunction/Variante63e936f2dd8434c002e261c142bf1bb4496c023af51ae44c97346626ab003d2.lean#L345).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6e9a63b72c5a3f1d67883130eb00174af8b5107c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
