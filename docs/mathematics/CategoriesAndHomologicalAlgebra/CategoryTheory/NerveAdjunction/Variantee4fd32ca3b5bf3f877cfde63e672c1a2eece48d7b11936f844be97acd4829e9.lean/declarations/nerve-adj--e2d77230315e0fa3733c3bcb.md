## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1af4b12386929dcdc3e22668a89a078458fffc75af8771684c7e39b56dc1f00f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 333–352.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def nerve₂Adj : hoFunctor₂.{u} ⊣ nerveFunctor₂ :=
  Adjunction.mkOfHomEquiv
    { homEquiv _ _ := (Cat.Hom.equivFunctor _ _).trans HomotopyCategory.functorEquiv
      homEquiv_naturality_left_symm _ _ := by ext1; exact HomotopyCategory.descOfTruncation_comp _ _
      homEquiv_naturality_right _ _ := HomotopyCategory.homToNerveMk_comp _ _ }

end Truncated

end SSet

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NerveAdjunction/Variantee4fd32ca3b5bf3f877cfde63e672c1a2eece48d7b11936f844be97acd4829e9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NerveAdjunction/Variantee4fd32ca3b5bf3f877cfde63e672c1a2eece48d7b11936f844be97acd4829e9.lean#L333).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dbb502bca8ac6ac01d14a22f00c00348a9475566` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
