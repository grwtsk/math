## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ab930691fd727e64cabef4ab9053d7b4d5c7c02ca7d6db027379fb38e2c9edb3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 483–489.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance nerve₂Adj.reflective : Reflective nerveFunctor₂.{u, u} :=
  Reflective.mk hoFunctor₂ nerve₂Adj

end

/-- The adjunction between the nerve functor and the homotopy category functor is, up to
isomorphism, the composite of the adjunctions `SSet.coskAdj 2` and `nerve₂Adj`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NerveAdjunction/Variant6870149eee4085afc5ea02773f377b3c767f99f60e2cc1306f9b8d7b41ed52c4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NerveAdjunction/Variant6870149eee4085afc5ea02773f377b3c767f99f60e2cc1306f9b8d7b41ed52c4.lean#L483).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e824dadfad76cb70459b8b482c37ad831d1edadc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
