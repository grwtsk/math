## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c31920c34321c8b72fee4c833ac8945094926e100f1368f096189c4dbd54457e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–135.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (X : B) :
    IsReflexivePair (F'.map (U.map (adj₁.counit.app X))) (otherMap _ _ adj₁ adj₂ X) :=
  IsReflexivePair.mk' (F'.map (adj₁.unit.app (U.obj X)))
    (by
      rw [← F'.map_comp, adj₁.right_triangle_components]
      apply F'.map_id)
    (by
      dsimp [otherMap]
      rw [← F'.map_comp_assoc, U.map_comp, adj₁.unit_naturality_assoc,
        adj₁.right_triangle_components, comp_id, adj₂.left_triangle_components])

variable [HasReflexiveCoequalizers A]

/-- Construct the object part of the desired left adjoint as the coequalizer of `F'Uε_Y` with
`otherMap`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Left/Variant9f36c7efb516a32da70b3b9ede11a94a987998eaa45a7de9893abf242e858910.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Left/Variant9f36c7efb516a32da70b3b9ede11a94a987998eaa45a7de9893abf242e858910.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5c7c97a260cd0c7a44526512b7724c257cd104bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
