## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:73378733-42a4-cb25-8346-6823284fe8ed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 257–262.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma opcyclesMap_id (n : ℤ) :
    X.opcyclesMap f g f g (𝟙 _) n = 𝟙 _ := by
  rw [← cancel_epi (X.pOpcycles f g n),
    X.p_opcyclesMap f g f g (𝟙 _) (𝟙 _),
    Functor.map_id, Category.comp_id, Category.id_comp]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Cycles/Variant4edd6767e62a845ca4d755ec0f01e55c68c4ba24f60f6298051cabd87dfe0b54.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Cycles/Variant4edd6767e62a845ca4d755ec0f01e55c68c4ba24f60f6298051cabd87dfe0b54.lean#L257).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `411ce3ef8fdd940b1cb567022ef465d6aadfeee1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
