## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2f92936e05c30f18cf3847b3afa7f5ba04a415185383c433e4709969595641bc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 80–99.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def buildIsLimit (t₁ : IsLimit c₁) (t₂ : IsLimit c₂) (hi : IsLimit i) :
    IsLimit (buildLimit s t hs ht i) where
  lift q := by
    refine hi.lift (Fork.ofι ?_ ?_)
    · refine t₁.lift (Fan.mk _ fun j => ?_)
      apply q.π.app j
    · apply t₂.hom_ext
      intro ⟨j⟩
      simp [hs, ht]
  uniq q m w := hi.hom_ext (i.equalizer_ext (t₁.hom_ext fun j => by simpa using w j.1))
  fac s j := by simp

end HasLimitOfHasProductsOfHasEqualizers

open HasLimitOfHasProductsOfHasEqualizers

/-- Given the existence of the appropriate (possibly finite) products and equalizers,
we can construct a limit cone for `F`.
(This assumes the existence of all equalizers, which is technically stronger than needed.)
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LimitsOfProductsAndEqualizers/Variant8d8c377f69f8d05cc2b62e3818ff3b0b1aead7a5b8eb2e5bcdb6d3096ac9516a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LimitsOfProductsAndEqualizers/Variant8d8c377f69f8d05cc2b62e3818ff3b0b1aead7a5b8eb2e5bcdb6d3096ac9516a.lean#L80).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0cb07be533ff817a9e71312353f10ec070224669` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
