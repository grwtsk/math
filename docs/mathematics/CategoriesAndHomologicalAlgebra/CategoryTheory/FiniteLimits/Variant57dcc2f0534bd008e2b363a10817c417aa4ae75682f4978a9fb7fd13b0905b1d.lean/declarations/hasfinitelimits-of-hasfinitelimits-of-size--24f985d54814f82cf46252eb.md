## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f3cbaed1-605c-1008-c9fd-641a8e6653cc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–93.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasFiniteLimits_of_hasFiniteLimits_of_size
    (h : ∀ (J : Type w) {𝒥 : SmallCategory J} (_ : @FinCategory J 𝒥), HasLimitsOfShape J C) :
    HasFiniteLimits C where
  out := fun J hJ hhJ => by
    haveI := h (ULiftHom.{w} (ULift.{w} J)) <| @CategoryTheory.finCategoryUlift J hJ hhJ
    have l : @Equivalence J (ULiftHom (ULift J)) hJ
                          (@ULiftHom.category (ULift J) (@uliftCategory J hJ)) :=
      @ULiftHomULiftCategory.equiv J hJ
    apply @hasLimitsOfShape_of_equivalence (ULiftHom (ULift J))
      (@ULiftHom.category (ULift J) (@uliftCategory J hJ)) C _ J hJ
      (@Equivalence.symm J hJ (ULiftHom (ULift J))
      (@ULiftHom.category (ULift J) (@uliftCategory J hJ)) l) _
    /- Porting note: tried to factor out (@instCategoryULiftHom (ULift J) (@uliftCategory J hJ)
    but when doing that would then find the instance and say it was not definitionally equal to
    the provided one (the same thing factored out) -/

/-- A category has all finite colimits if every functor `J ⥤ C` with a `FinCategory J`
instance and `J : Type` has a colimit.

This is often called 'finitely cocomplete'.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FiniteLimits/Variant57dcc2f0534bd008e2b363a10817c417aa4ae75682f4978a9fb7fd13b0905b1d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FiniteLimits/Variant57dcc2f0534bd008e2b363a10817c417aa4ae75682f4978a9fb7fd13b0905b1d.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a477c367cc1fae77d64751b7957e78e01e7d7cf4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
