## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:53756bbf-10b8-a72b-f353-4a3897e20174`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 75–96.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasFiniteLimits_of_hasFiniteLimits_of_size
    (h : ∀ (J : Type w) {𝒥 : SmallCategory J} (_ : @FinCategory J 𝒥), HasLimitsOfShape J C) :
    HasFiniteLimits C where

    /- Porting note: tried to factor out (@instCategoryULiftHom (ULift J) (@uliftCategory J hJ)
    but when doing that would then find the instance and say it was not definitionally equal to
    the provided one (the same thing factored out) -/
#align category_theory.limits.has_finite_limits_of_has_finite_limits_of_size CategoryTheory.Limits.hasFiniteLimits_of_hasFiniteLimits_of_size

/-- A category has all finite colimits if every functor `J ⥤ C` with a `FinCategory J`
instance and `J : Type` has a colimit.

This is often called 'finitely cocomplete'.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FiniteLimits/Variant59481f8df8cde688c2b787ebc060c9dffd5c9d464841e89fb8523c7bf0537c2a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FiniteLimits/Variant59481f8df8cde688c2b787ebc060c9dffd5c9d464841e89fb8523c7bf0537c2a.lean#L75).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `17df89ef677ad838c18d115768571f1f8642804d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
