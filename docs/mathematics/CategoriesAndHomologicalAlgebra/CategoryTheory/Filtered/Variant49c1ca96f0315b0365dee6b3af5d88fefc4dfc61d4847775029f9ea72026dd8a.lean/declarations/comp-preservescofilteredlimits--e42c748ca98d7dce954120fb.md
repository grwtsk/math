## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b8d4b31e2cda0d4f496097fb5a5a7024ab0966c0031d3fd6cd0e487b2b40fed5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 180–185.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance comp_preservesCofilteredLimits (F : C ⥤ D) (G : D ⥤ E)
    [PreservesCofilteredLimitsOfSize.{w, w'} F] [PreservesCofilteredLimitsOfSize.{w, w'} G] :
      PreservesCofilteredLimitsOfSize.{w, w'} (F ⋙ G) where
  preserves_cofiltered_limits _ := inferInstance

/-- A functor preserving larger cofiltered limits also preserves smaller cofiltered limits. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Filtered/Variant49c1ca96f0315b0365dee6b3af5d88fefc4dfc61d4847775029f9ea72026dd8a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Filtered/Variant49c1ca96f0315b0365dee6b3af5d88fefc4dfc61d4847775029f9ea72026dd8a.lean#L180).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `638cb1e7ce036f9f50cfafa42327f1f8bbbd3270` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
