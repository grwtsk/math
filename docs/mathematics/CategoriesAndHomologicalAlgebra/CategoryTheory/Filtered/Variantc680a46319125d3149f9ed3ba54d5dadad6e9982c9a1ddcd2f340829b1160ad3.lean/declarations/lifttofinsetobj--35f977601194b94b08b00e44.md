## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:851835dc0dbc7624e29eda41245cc77bf32968f41fb51412090d8649fca588ea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 45–54.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

def liftToFinsetObj (F : Discrete α ⥤ C) : Finset (Discrete α) ⥤ C where
  obj s := ∐ fun x : s => F.obj x
  map {_ Y} h := Sigma.desc fun y =>
    Sigma.ι (fun (x : { x // x ∈ Y }) => F.obj x) ⟨y, h.down.down y.2⟩

taking the colimit of the diagram formed by the coproducts of finite sets over the indexing type. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Filtered/Variantc680a46319125d3149f9ed3ba54d5dadad6e9982c9a1ddcd2f340829b1160ad3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Filtered/Variantc680a46319125d3149f9ed3ba54d5dadad6e9982c9a1ddcd2f340829b1160ad3.lean#L45).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `69d36773b0aa9376c5ac5a0aa9246906e53b0e29` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
