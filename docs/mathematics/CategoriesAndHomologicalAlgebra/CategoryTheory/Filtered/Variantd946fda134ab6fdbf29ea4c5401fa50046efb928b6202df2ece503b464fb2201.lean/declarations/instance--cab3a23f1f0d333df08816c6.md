## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1a1083a2a2fa3ec73951cd23a592f197d3d9129a0eff84d964541cf1c517e836`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–105.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) isFilteredOrEmpty_of_semilatticeSup (α : Type u) [SemilatticeSup α] :
    IsFilteredOrEmpty α
    where
  cocone_objs X Y := ⟨X ⊔ Y, homOfLE le_sup_left, homOfLE le_sup_right, trivial⟩
  cocone_maps X Y f g := ⟨Y, 𝟙 _, by
    apply ULift.ext
    apply Subsingleton.elim⟩
#align category_theory.is_filtered_or_empty_of_semilattice_sup CategoryTheory.isFilteredOrEmpty_of_semilatticeSup

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Filtered/Variantd946fda134ab6fdbf29ea4c5401fa50046efb928b6202df2ece503b464fb2201.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Filtered/Variantd946fda134ab6fdbf29ea4c5401fa50046efb928b6202df2ece503b464fb2201.lean#L97).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2d130e88eae454a3b1310ab9d0ce6ebf7f58630b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
