## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2223b2be2f6c29026fd798c887b5f0cf6bde00e1c0f0c90016b0750a59d731cd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 128–133.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def preservesLimitsOfShapeRightOp (F : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ D) [PreservesColimitsOfShape Jᵒᵖ F] :
    PreservesLimitsOfShape J F.rightOp where preservesLimit {K} := preservesLimitRightOp K F
#align category_theory.limits.preserves_limits_of_shape_right_op CategoryTheory.Limits.preservesLimitsOfShapeRightOp

/-- If `F : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ Dᵒᵖ` preserves colimits of shape `Jᵒᵖ`, then `F.unop : C ⥤ D` preserves limits of
    shape `J`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Opposites/Variantde912cc1ad9f61d6660be2fdf19428d02be3d2609be4d8ad51f6ab595c149985.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Opposites/Variantde912cc1ad9f61d6660be2fdf19428d02be3d2609be4d8ad51f6ab595c149985.lean#L128).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ef00d9191c63ed2423eeb07e7340687dfec5a597` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
