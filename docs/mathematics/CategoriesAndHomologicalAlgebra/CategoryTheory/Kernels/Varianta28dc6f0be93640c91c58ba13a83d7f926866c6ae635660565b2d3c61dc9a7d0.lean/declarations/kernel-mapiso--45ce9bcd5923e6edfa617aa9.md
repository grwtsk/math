## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1379f8f1e0f23c1e37b362efb6475c54b6a66a5c2a1a2bf42422620882a64577`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 371–380.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def kernel.mapIso {X' Y' : C} (f' : X' ⟶ Y') [HasKernel f'] (p : X ≅ X') (q : Y ≅ Y')
    (w : f ≫ q.hom = p.hom ≫ f') : kernel f ≅ kernel f' where
  hom := kernel.map f f' p.hom q.hom w
  inv :=
    kernel.map f' f p.inv q.inv
      (by
        refine (cancel_mono q.hom).1 ?_
        simp [w])

/-- Every kernel of the zero morphism is an isomorphism -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Kernels/Varianta28dc6f0be93640c91c58ba13a83d7f926866c6ae635660565b2d3c61dc9a7d0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Kernels/Varianta28dc6f0be93640c91c58ba13a83d7f926866c6ae635660565b2d3c61dc9a7d0.lean#L371).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9b4ec68a0c0da22eab44424ebb5b5468d8d73b60` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
