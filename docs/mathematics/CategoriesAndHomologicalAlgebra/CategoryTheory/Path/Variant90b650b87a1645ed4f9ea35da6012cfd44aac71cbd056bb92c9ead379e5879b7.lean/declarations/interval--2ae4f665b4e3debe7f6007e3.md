## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:93c9a64c4b03e4d125740dcba6b808d46d94bd8576283c5233b9f32bb721b44a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 96–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def interval (f : Path X m) (j l : ℕ) (h : j + l ≤ m := by omega) : Path X l where
  vertex i := f.vertex ⟨j + i, by omega⟩
  arrow i := f.arrow ⟨j + i, by omega⟩
  arrow_src i := f.arrow_src ⟨j + i, by omega⟩
  arrow_tgt i := f.arrow_tgt ⟨j + i, by omega⟩

variable {X Y : SSet.Truncated.{u} (n + 1)} {m : ℕ}

/-- Maps of `n + 1`-truncated simplicial sets induce maps of paths. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Path/Variant90b650b87a1645ed4f9ea35da6012cfd44aac71cbd056bb92c9ead379e5879b7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Path/Variant90b650b87a1645ed4f9ea35da6012cfd44aac71cbd056bb92c9ead379e5879b7.lean#L96).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7bfcfd4b81105455fa6ffdb35dd034394c71bf83` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
