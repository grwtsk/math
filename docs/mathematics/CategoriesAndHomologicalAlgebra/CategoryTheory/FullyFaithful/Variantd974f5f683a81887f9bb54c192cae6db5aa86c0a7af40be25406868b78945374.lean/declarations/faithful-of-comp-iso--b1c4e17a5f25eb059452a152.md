## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bf90f282-b9f4-bbf8-4e79-afc6b74971fc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 291–297.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Faithful.of_comp_iso {H : C ⥤ E} [H.Faithful] (h : F ⋙ G ≅ H) : F.Faithful :=
  @Faithful.of_comp _ _ _ _ _ _ F G (Faithful.of_iso h.symm)

alias _root_.CategoryTheory.Iso.faithful_of_comp := Faithful.of_comp_iso

-- We could prove this from `Faithful.of_comp_iso` using `eq_to_iso`,
-- but that would introduce a cyclic import.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FullyFaithful/Variantd974f5f683a81887f9bb54c192cae6db5aa86c0a7af40be25406868b78945374.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FullyFaithful/Variantd974f5f683a81887f9bb54c192cae6db5aa86c0a7af40be25406868b78945374.lean#L291).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7d269cbf20f4b3649f28cbb46416129dafce087b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
