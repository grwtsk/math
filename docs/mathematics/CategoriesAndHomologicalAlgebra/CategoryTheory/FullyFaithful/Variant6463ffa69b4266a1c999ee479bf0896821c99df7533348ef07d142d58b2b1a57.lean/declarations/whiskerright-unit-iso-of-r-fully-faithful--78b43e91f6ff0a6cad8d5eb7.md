## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ab56dd214a07325b894d2c5d2520025f61c43c86f55eecba9448a43c6723dfc9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 182–205.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean

-- TODO also do the statements from Riehl 4.5.13 for full and faithful separately?
universe v₃ v₄ u₃ u₄

variable {C' : Type u₃} [Category.{v₃} C']

variable {D' : Type u₄} [Category.{v₄} D']

-- TODO: This needs some lemmas describing the produced adjunction, probably in terms of `adj`,
-- `iC` and `iD`.
/-- If `C` is a full subcategory of `C'` and `D` is a full subcategory of `D'`, then we can restrict
an adjunction `L' ⊣ R'` where `L' : C' ⥤ D'` and `R' : D' ⥤ C'` to `C` and `D`.
The construction here is slightly more general, in that `C` is required only to have a full and
faithful "inclusion" functor `iC : C ⥤ C'` (and similarly `iD : D ⥤ D'`) which commute (up to
natural isomorphism) with the proposed restrictions.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FullyFaithful/Variant6463ffa69b4266a1c999ee479bf0896821c99df7533348ef07d142d58b2b1a57.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FullyFaithful/Variant6463ffa69b4266a1c999ee479bf0896821c99df7533348ef07d142d58b2b1a57.lean#L182).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9050d4a6b33b47461d1eebdc4f29c532dae21fed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
