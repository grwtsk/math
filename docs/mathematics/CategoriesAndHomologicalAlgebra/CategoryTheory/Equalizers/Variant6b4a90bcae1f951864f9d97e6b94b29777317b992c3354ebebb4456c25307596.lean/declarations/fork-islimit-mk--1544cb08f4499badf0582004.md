## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:55e5d3afd2acc895acf86eb21dc104efeda285947faa4ec8f5b0b27e50b3a097`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 435–446.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Fork.IsLimit.mk (t : Fork f g) (lift : ∀ s : Fork f g, s.pt ⟶ t.pt)
    (fac : ∀ s : Fork f g, lift s ≫ Fork.ι t = Fork.ι s)
    (uniq : ∀ (s : Fork f g) (m : s.pt ⟶ t.pt) (_ : m ≫ t.ι = s.ι), m = lift s) : IsLimit t :=
  { lift
    fac := fun s j =>
      WalkingParallelPair.casesOn j (fac s) <| by
        erw [← s.w left, ← t.w left, ← Category.assoc, fac]; rfl
    uniq := fun s m j => by aesop}

/-- This is another convenient method to verify that a fork is a limit cone. It
    only asks for a proof of facts that carry any mathematical content, and allows access to the
    same `s` for all parts. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Equalizers/Variant6b4a90bcae1f951864f9d97e6b94b29777317b992c3354ebebb4456c25307596.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Equalizers/Variant6b4a90bcae1f951864f9d97e6b94b29777317b992c3354ebebb4456c25307596.lean#L435).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6189c7e47c707029cc16c2f3b2a719a43a9052c8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
