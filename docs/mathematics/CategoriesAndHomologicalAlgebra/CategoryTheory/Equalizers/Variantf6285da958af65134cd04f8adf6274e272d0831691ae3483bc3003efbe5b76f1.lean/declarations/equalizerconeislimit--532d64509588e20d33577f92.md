## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e63912c9ae0dc25b2ab21c4c13d66aeba872499f98e5d0151ce4e64a4b0b4532`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 67–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def equalizerConeIsLimit (F : WalkingParallelPair ⥤ C) : IsLimit (equalizerCone F) where
  lift c := pullback.lift (c.π.app _) (c.π.app _)
  fac := by rintro c (_ | _) <;> simp
  uniq := by
    intro c _ J
    have J0 := J WalkingParallelPair.zero
    apply pullback.hom_ext
    · simpa [limit.lift_π] using J0
    · simp [← J0, pullbackFst_eq_pullback_snd]

end HasEqualizersOfHasPullbacksAndBinaryProducts

open HasEqualizersOfHasPullbacksAndBinaryProducts

-- This is not an instance, as it is not always how one wants to construct equalizers!
/-- Any category with pullbacks and binary products, has equalizers. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Equalizers/Variantf6285da958af65134cd04f8adf6274e272d0831691ae3483bc3003efbe5b76f1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Equalizers/Variantf6285da958af65134cd04f8adf6274e272d0831691ae3483bc3003efbe5b76f1.lean#L67).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `41483be4204fd2c3d579f1ca187b6168d3cba27e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
