## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c892573-1c58-8fce-9619-2174412c4c41`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 67–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma PreservesLimitsOfSize.preservesFiniteLimits (F : C ⥤ D)
    [PreservesLimitsOfSize.{w, w₂} F] : PreservesFiniteLimits F where
  preservesFiniteLimits J (sJ : SmallCategory J) fJ := by
    have := preservesSmallestLimits_of_preservesLimits F
    exact preservesLimitsOfShape_of_equiv (FinCategory.equivAsType J) F

-- Added as a specialization of the dangerous instance above, for limits indexed in Type 0.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Finite/Variant47f1eb7dea959f324af1eb42ac0fccfb7c24aef070e5fb4c435a14bf81bcee45.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Finite/Variant47f1eb7dea959f324af1eb42ac0fccfb7c24aef070e5fb4c435a14bf81bcee45.lean#L67).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fe6faf17b43ddf8eb51fa69eb8e2ae7f709f3433` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
