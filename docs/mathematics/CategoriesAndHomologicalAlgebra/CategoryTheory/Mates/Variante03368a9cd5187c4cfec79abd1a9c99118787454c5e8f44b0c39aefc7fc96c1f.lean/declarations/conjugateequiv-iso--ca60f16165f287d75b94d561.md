## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5339c7cb76072ed41b4ad2ca3e09ce9be05c498604bedab768a9b1ad864f6c0b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 391–398.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance conjugateEquiv_iso (α : L₂ ⟶ L₁) [IsIso α] :
    IsIso (conjugateEquiv adj₁ adj₂ α) :=
  ⟨⟨conjugateEquiv adj₂ adj₁ (inv α),
      ⟨conjugateEquiv_comm _ _ (by simp), conjugateEquiv_comm _ _ (by simp)⟩⟩⟩

/-- If `α` is an isomorphism between right adjoints, then its conjugate transformation is an
isomorphism. The converse is given in `conjugateEquiv_symm_of_iso`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Mates/Variante03368a9cd5187c4cfec79abd1a9c99118787454c5e8f44b0c39aefc7fc96c1f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Mates/Variante03368a9cd5187c4cfec79abd1a9c99118787454c5e8f44b0c39aefc7fc96c1f.lean#L391).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac742bc02e4759e5a7ec21abd787ef8a6509f3b7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
