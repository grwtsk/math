## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:386f60d9-700c-568e-f707-e8877d24a5df`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 226–255.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

variable [Category.{v₁} C] [Category.{v₂} D]
variable {L₁ L₂ : C ⥤ D} {R₁ R₂ : D ⥤ C}
variable (adj₁ : L₁ ⊣ R₁) (adj₂ : L₂ ⊣ R₂)

/-- Given two adjunctions `L₁ ⊣ R₁` and `L₂ ⊣ R₂` both between categories `C`, `D`, there is a
bijection between natural transformations `L₂ ⟶ L₁` and natural transformations `R₁ ⟶ R₂`. This is
defined as a special case of `mateEquiv`, where the two "vertical" functors are identity, modulo
composition with the unitors. Corresponding natural transformations are called `conjugateEquiv`.
TODO: Generalise to when the two vertical functors are equivalences rather than being exactly `𝟭`.

Furthermore, this bijection preserves (and reflects) isomorphisms, i.e. a transformation is an iso
iff its image under the bijection is an iso, see eg `CategoryTheory.conjugateIsoEquiv`.
This is in contrast to the general case `mateEquiv` which does not in general have this property.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Mates/Variant334765678192e403f3e793175e2314fd478781aa285effbcf5247346c3007498.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Mates/Variant334765678192e403f3e793175e2314fd478781aa285effbcf5247346c3007498.lean#L226).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d8983fbc15b0c685a03faf33bd9d03aab8e47e1a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
