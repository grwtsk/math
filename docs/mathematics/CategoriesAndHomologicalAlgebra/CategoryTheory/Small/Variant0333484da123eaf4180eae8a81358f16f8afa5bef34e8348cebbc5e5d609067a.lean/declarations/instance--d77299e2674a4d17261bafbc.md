## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c92d956edf93405b480e529d56f6538aeb842407ef05a9e9a8af1da22738b2ad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 181–192.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {α : Type*} (P : α → ObjectProperty C)
    [∀ a, ObjectProperty.EssentiallySmall.{w} (P a)] [Small.{w} α] :
    ObjectProperty.EssentiallySmall.{w} (⨆ a, P a) where
  exists_small_le' := by
    have h (a : α) := EssentiallySmall.exists_small_le' (P a)
    choose Q _ hQ using h
    refine ⟨⨆ a, Q a, inferInstance, ?_⟩
    simp only [iSup_le_iff]
    intro a
    exact (hQ a).trans (monotone_isoClosure (le_iSup Q a))

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Small/Variant0333484da123eaf4180eae8a81358f16f8afa5bef34e8348cebbc5e5d609067a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Small/Variant0333484da123eaf4180eae8a81358f16f8afa5bef34e8348cebbc5e5d609067a.lean#L181).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f2a8189732d657bf7852b9b2c8f15df804ee2b2e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
