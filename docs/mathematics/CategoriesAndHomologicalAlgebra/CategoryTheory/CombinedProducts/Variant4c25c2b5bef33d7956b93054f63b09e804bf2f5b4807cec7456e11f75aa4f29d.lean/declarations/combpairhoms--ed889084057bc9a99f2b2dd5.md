## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f687ef94aff81a4967cb379101334140bdaa6a3a7cba855f23df8eb193d1c5b1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 72–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev combPairHoms : (i : ι₁ ⊕ ι₂) → Sum.elim f₁ f₂ i ⟶ bc.pt
  | .inl a => c₁.inj a ≫ bc.inl
  | .inr a => c₂.inj a ≫ bc.inr

variable {c₁ c₂ bc}

/-- If `c₁` and `c₂` are colimit cofans and `bc` is a colimit binary cofan on their cocone
points, then the cofan constructed from `combPairHoms` is a colimit cocone. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CombinedProducts/Variant4c25c2b5bef33d7956b93054f63b09e804bf2f5b4807cec7456e11f75aa4f29d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CombinedProducts/Variant4c25c2b5bef33d7956b93054f63b09e804bf2f5b4807cec7456e11f75aa4f29d.lean#L72).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4563605f05c2426d9f414eeca8eb8ee96598255d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
