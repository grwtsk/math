## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fd5cc9dcb52a2f7db95aac17cf795b5073ac56d7114f42c8d3d14c5afcc12050`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–52.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ReflPrefunctor (V : Type u₁) [ReflQuiver.{v₁} V] (W : Type u₂) [ReflQuiver.{v₂} W]
    extends Prefunctor V W where
  /-- A functor preserves identity morphisms. -/
  map_id : ∀ X : V, map (𝟙rq X) = 𝟙rq (obj X) := by aesop_cat

namespace ReflPrefunctor

-- These lemmas can not be `@[simp]` because after `whnfR` they have a variable on the LHS.
-- Nevertheless they are sometimes useful when building functors.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ReflQuiver/Variant3b52f95c80d319685fe71811faa4e2a987ef0f5a299e7c22ef279de9e4917ba6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ReflQuiver/Variant3b52f95c80d319685fe71811faa4e2a987ef0f5a299e7c22ef279de9e4917ba6.lean#L44).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b582a9a77bf014bb6b41285c2a8ef9597bb7d13e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
