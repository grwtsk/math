## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1085a353ca703e91b56abb896d1b9eba3836f50c16e3e4c71bffbf2e43bdb5d9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–50.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def imageSieve {F G : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ A} (f : F ⟶ G) {U : C} (s : ToType (G.obj (op U))) : Sieve U where
  arrows V i := ∃ t : ToType (F.obj (op V)), f.app _ t = G.map i.op s
  downward_closed := by
    rintro V W i ⟨t, ht⟩ j
    refine ⟨F.map j.op t, ?_⟩
    rw [op_comp, G.map_comp, ConcreteCategory.comp_apply, ← ht, NatTrans.naturality_apply f]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LocallySurjective/Variant7d47b4c0bff7275ee63800019e6dd565459b64f8d81e07055bf87eb11bd584cf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LocallySurjective/Variant7d47b4c0bff7275ee63800019e6dd565459b64f8d81e07055bf87eb11bd584cf.lean#L44).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f659a8828b111e9a60ab65cb96c3db1eb55d731` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
