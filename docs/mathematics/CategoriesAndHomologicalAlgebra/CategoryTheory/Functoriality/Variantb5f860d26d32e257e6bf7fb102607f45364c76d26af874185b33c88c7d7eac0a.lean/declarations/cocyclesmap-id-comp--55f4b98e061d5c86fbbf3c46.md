## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e3dee795-3fd7-2f44-c396-a6efce4e4fb9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 111–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cocyclesMap_id_comp {A B C : Rep k G} (φ : A ⟶ B) (ψ : B ⟶ C) (n : ℕ) :
    cocyclesMap (MonoidHom.id G) (φ ≫ ψ) n =
      cocyclesMap (MonoidHom.id G) φ n ≫ cocyclesMap (MonoidHom.id G) ψ n := by
  simp [cocyclesMap, cochainsMap_id_comp, HomologicalComplex.cyclesMap_comp]

/-- Given a group homomorphism `f : G →* H` and a representation morphism `φ : Res(f)(A) ⟶ B`,
this is the induced map `Hⁿ(H, A) ⟶ Hⁿ(G, B)` sending `x : Hⁿ → A` to
`(g : Gⁿ) ↦ φ (x (f ∘ g))`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Functoriality/Variantb5f860d26d32e257e6bf7fb102607f45364c76d26af874185b33c88c7d7eac0a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Functoriality/Variantb5f860d26d32e257e6bf7fb102607f45364c76d26af874185b33c88c7d7eac0a.lean#L111).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dd942a8d415dbb9117b14942c5a22cbe6e885b35` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
