## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7017e71163e1e08697f8e311248e93d19a4c8a4bed06cefdcc1536d7579bb02f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 302–317.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def mapShortComplexH1 :
    shortComplexH1 A ⟶ shortComplexH1 B where
  τ₁ := chainsMap₂ f φ
  τ₂ := chainsMap₁ f φ
  τ₃ := φ.toModuleCatHom
  comm₁₂ := by
    simp only [shortComplexH1]
    ext : 3
    simpa [d₂₁, map_add, map_sub, ← map_inv] using congr(single _ $((hom_comm_apply φ _ _).symm))
  comm₂₃ := by
    simp only [shortComplexH1]
    ext : 3
    simpa [← map_inv, d₁₀] using (hom_comm_apply φ _ _).symm

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Functoriality/Variant2ab22df89253d7353cd8382ef46307c590d21fdbe2e35f59fd3478a27b9ba4e1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Functoriality/Variant2ab22df89253d7353cd8382ef46307c590d21fdbe2e35f59fd3478a27b9ba4e1.lean#L302).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8e0b9a3f030f6296c8e9aad3fde22f5439e1007e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
