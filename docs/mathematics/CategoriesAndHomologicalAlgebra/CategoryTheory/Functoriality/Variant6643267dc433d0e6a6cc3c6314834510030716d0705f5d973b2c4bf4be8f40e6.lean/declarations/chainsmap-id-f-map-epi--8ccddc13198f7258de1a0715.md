## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:131c5c820e4bf3f7b4342322efad29948dd4efa3b2876d29f0298d5c48864459`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 127–133.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance chainsMap_id_f_map_epi {A B : Rep k G} (φ : A ⟶ B) [Epi φ] (i : ℕ) :
    Epi ((chainsMap (MonoidHom.id G) φ).f i) :=
  chainsMap_f_map_epi _ _ (fun x => ⟨x, rfl⟩) _

/-- Given a group homomorphism `f : G →* H` and a representation morphism `φ : A ⟶ Res(f)(B)`,
this is the induced map `Zₙ(G, A) ⟶ Zₙ(H, B)` sending `∑ aᵢ·gᵢ : Gⁿ →₀ A` to
`∑ φ(aᵢ)·(f ∘ gᵢ) : Hⁿ →₀ B`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Functoriality/Variant6643267dc433d0e6a6cc3c6314834510030716d0705f5d973b2c4bf4be8f40e6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Functoriality/Variant6643267dc433d0e6a6cc3c6314834510030716d0705f5d973b2c4bf4be8f40e6.lean#L127).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dbec9594e66168c2d1d03bae1a5226da75e2724c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
