## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:33bb64b42d412b0ba7f0768d54ac10bed0037b4a679375c51add671048d2d571`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 105–121.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def linear (hr : ∀ (a : R) ⦃X Y : C⦄ (f₁ f₂ : X ⟶ Y) (_ : r f₁ f₂), r (a • f₁) (a • f₂))
    [Preadditive (Quotient r)] [(functor r).Additive] : Linear R (Quotient r) := by
  letI := Linear.module r hr
  exact
    { smul_comp := by
        rintro ⟨X⟩ ⟨Y⟩ ⟨Z⟩ a f g
        obtain ⟨f, rfl⟩ := (functor r).map_surjective f
        obtain ⟨g, rfl⟩ := (functor r).map_surjective g
        rw [Linear.smul_eq, ← Functor.map_comp, ← Functor.map_comp,
          Linear.smul_eq, Linear.smul_comp]
      comp_smul := by
        rintro ⟨X⟩ ⟨Y⟩ ⟨Z⟩ f a g
        obtain ⟨f, rfl⟩ := (functor r).map_surjective f
        obtain ⟨g, rfl⟩ := (functor r).map_surjective g
        rw [Linear.smul_eq, ← Functor.map_comp, ← Functor.map_comp,
          Linear.smul_eq, Linear.comp_smul] }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Linear/Variantcf2ea28b501948d5a8d5b11fbaf9b792a0aefcbb83fb35123cb3ad89cb107682.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Linear/Variantcf2ea28b501948d5a8d5b11fbaf9b792a0aefcbb83fb35123cb3ad89cb107682.lean#L105).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5fbab7a5fe434349cace8be7cc05592645de4b2c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
