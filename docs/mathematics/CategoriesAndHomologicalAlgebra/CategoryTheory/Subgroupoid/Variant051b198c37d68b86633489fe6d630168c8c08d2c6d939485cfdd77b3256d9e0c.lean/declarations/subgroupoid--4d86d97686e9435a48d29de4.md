## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:83757235a56de51f4247a1b60af014298a169bc7c363b9226870c27306460ec1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 81–90.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Subgroupoid (C : Type u) [Groupoid C] where
  arrows : ∀ c d : C, Set (c ⟶ d)
  protected inv : ∀ {c d} {p : c ⟶ d}, p ∈ arrows c d → Groupoid.inv p ∈ arrows d c
  protected mul : ∀ {c d e} {p}, p ∈ arrows c d → ∀ {q}, q ∈ arrows d e → p ≫ q ∈ arrows c e
#align category_theory.subgroupoid CategoryTheory.Subgroupoid

namespace Subgroupoid

variable (S : Subgroupoid C)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Subgroupoid/Variant051b198c37d68b86633489fe6d630168c8c08d2c6d939485cfdd77b3256d9e0c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Subgroupoid/Variant051b198c37d68b86633489fe6d630168c8c08d2c6d939485cfdd77b3256d9e0c.lean#L81).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2910dee500394f7b63e434ee369da8e5f712fb3f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
