## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:37999e90aa9b8d30d1c972400bb5e60c56b4d3805ca96ad24c375a1c60c809e6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 157–163.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def vertexSubgroup {c : C} (hc : c ∈ S.objs) : Subgroup (c ⟶ c) where
  carrier := S.arrows c c
  mul_mem' hf hg := S.mul hf hg
  one_mem' := id_mem_of_nonempty_isotropy _ _ hc
  inv_mem' hf := S.inv hf

/-- The set of all arrows of a subgroupoid, as a set in `Σ c d : C, c ⟶ d`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Subgroupoid/Variant1e2b20b45a7d5e4726a92b722a41d0c19d3243eb495f091c81ff819e92bb8fb7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Subgroupoid/Variant1e2b20b45a7d5e4726a92b722a41d0c19d3243eb495f091c81ff819e92bb8fb7.lean#L157).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1b8108218b024547c2d5d3573d3567d11971be0f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
