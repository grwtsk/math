## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4d2bacd3-173c-0ce7-d9cd-43bb8732b6ce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 106–115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mul_mem_cancel_right {c d e : C} {f : c ⟶ d} {g : d ⟶ e} (hg : g ∈ S.arrows d e) :
    f ≫ g ∈ S.arrows c e ↔ f ∈ S.arrows c d := by
  constructor
  · rintro h
    suffices (f ≫ g) ≫ Groupoid.inv g ∈ S.arrows c d by
      simpa only [inv_eq_inv, IsIso.hom_inv_id, Category.comp_id, Category.assoc] using this
    apply S.mul h (S.inv hg)
  · exact fun hf => S.mul hf hg

/-- The vertices of `C` on which `S` has non-trivial isotropy -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Subgroupoid/Variant45911815583b20c94c4df7f1fe28c2636afe7ebffc89be6e9e82caa6a07d92a1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Subgroupoid/Variant45911815583b20c94c4df7f1fe28c2636afe7ebffc89be6e9e82caa6a07d92a1.lean#L106).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `851637fe159549354e651b141f8d72e0c8a54d00` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
