## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ae0b94b4-4cc4-b6f0-1a5e-c7796f175c8f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 255–262.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem epi_of_epi_of_epi_of_epi (hR₂ : R₂.Exact) (hR₁' : Epi R₁.g) (h₀ : Epi φ.τ₁)
    (h₁ : Epi φ.τ₃) : Epi φ.τ₂ :=
  Abelian.epi_of_epi_of_epi_of_epi (ShortComplex.mapToComposableArrows φ)
    hR₂.exact_toComposableArrows hR₁' h₀ h₁

end ShortComplex

end CategoryTheory
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Four/Variant28c38280e1e1139a5bb4a2a0508bfbaa9c4bd1adf4d64fc4a2f7f347787e1aa3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Four/Variant28c38280e1e1139a5bb4a2a0508bfbaa9c4bd1adf4d64fc4a2f7f347787e1aa3.lean#L255).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `137da5d7cc72b45967a2c92089f0cc9d946f430c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
