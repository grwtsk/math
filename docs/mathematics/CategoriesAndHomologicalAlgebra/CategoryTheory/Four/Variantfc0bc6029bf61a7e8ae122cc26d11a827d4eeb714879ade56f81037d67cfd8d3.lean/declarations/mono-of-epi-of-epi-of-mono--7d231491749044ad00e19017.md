## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d94f4f26-b660-553f-e31f-8e60d1963d55`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 169–174.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mono_of_epi_of_epi_of_mono (hR₁ : R₁.Exact) (hR₂ : R₂.Exact)
    (hR₁' : Epi (R₁.map' 1 2)) (h₀ : Epi (app' φ 0)) (h₁ : Mono (app' φ 1)) :
    Mono (app' φ 2) :=
  mono_of_epi_of_epi_mono' φ (by simpa only [map'_comp R₁ 0 1 2] using hR₁.toIsComplex.zero 0)
    hR₁' hR₂ h₀ h₁

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Four/Variantfc0bc6029bf61a7e8ae122cc26d11a827d4eeb714879ade56f81037d67cfd8d3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Four/Variantfc0bc6029bf61a7e8ae122cc26d11a827d4eeb714879ade56f81037d67cfd8d3.lean#L169).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fc443c76cb081a4b4a11a8690dc0d068608fe411` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
