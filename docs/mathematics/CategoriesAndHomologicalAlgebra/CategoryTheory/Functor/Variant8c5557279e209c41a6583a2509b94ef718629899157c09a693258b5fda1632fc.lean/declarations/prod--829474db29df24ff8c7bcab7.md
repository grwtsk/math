## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2ff7c5fb-1d57-5a24-4c99-ce9feb330cb1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 420–432.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem prod'_μ (X Y : C) : (F.prod' G).μ X Y = (F.μ X Y, G.μ X Y) := by
  dsimp [prod']
  simp
#align category_theory.lax_monoidal_functor.prod'_μ CategoryTheory.LaxMonoidalFunctor.prod'_μ

end LaxMonoidalFunctor

namespace MonoidalFunctor

variable (F : MonoidalFunctor.{v₁, v₂} C D) (G : MonoidalFunctor.{v₂, v₃} D E)

/-- The composition of two monoidal functors is again monoidal. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Functor/Variant8c5557279e209c41a6583a2509b94ef718629899157c09a693258b5fda1632fc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Functor/Variant8c5557279e209c41a6583a2509b94ef718629899157c09a693258b5fda1632fc.lean#L420).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `411c31fecbf3bc3d24ea318eaa0497586c23868d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
