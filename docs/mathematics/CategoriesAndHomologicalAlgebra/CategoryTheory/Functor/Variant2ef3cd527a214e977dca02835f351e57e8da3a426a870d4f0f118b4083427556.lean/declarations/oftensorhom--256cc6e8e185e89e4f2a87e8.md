## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6b9645699e8068898308da0e241c6bfb01dd5cf247901a6349990fb31bc50188`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 182–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofTensorHom : F.LaxMonoidal where
  ε' := ε'
  μ' := μ'
  μ'_natural_left := fun f X' => by
    simp_rw [← tensorHom_id, ← F.map_id, μ'_natural]
  μ'_natural_right := fun X' f => by
    simp_rw [← id_tensorHom, ← F.map_id, μ'_natural]
  associativity' := fun X Y Z => by
    simp_rw [← tensorHom_id, ← id_tensorHom, associativity']
  left_unitality' := fun X => by
    simp_rw [← tensorHom_id, left_unitality']
  right_unitality' := fun X => by
    simp_rw [← id_tensorHom, right_unitality']

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Functor/Variant2ef3cd527a214e977dca02835f351e57e8da3a426a870d4f0f118b4083427556.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Functor/Variant2ef3cd527a214e977dca02835f351e57e8da3a426a870d4f0f118b4083427556.lean#L182).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `68bb750593486128ed6d43177bb525afb4f7c13c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
