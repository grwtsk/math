## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bb4947d773263c402c38497238fe88705030208dd9f1b3191f549b9fc6be8473`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 167–184.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mapTriangleIso {F₁ F₂ : C ⥤ D} (e : F₁ ≅ F₂) [F₁.CommShift ℤ] [F₂.CommShift ℤ]
    [NatTrans.CommShift e.hom ℤ] : F₁.mapTriangle ≅ F₂.mapTriangle :=
  NatIso.ofComponents (fun T =>
    Triangle.isoMk _ _ (e.app _) (e.app _) (e.app _) (by simp) (by simp) (by
      dsimp
      simp only [assoc, NatTrans.shift_app_comm e.hom (1 : ℤ) T.obj₁,
        NatTrans.naturality_assoc])) (by cat_disch)

end Additive

variable [HasZeroObject C] [HasZeroObject D] [HasZeroObject E]
  [Preadditive C] [Preadditive D] [Preadditive E]
  [∀ (n : ℤ), (shiftFunctor C n).Additive] [∀ (n : ℤ), (shiftFunctor D n).Additive]
  [∀ (n : ℤ), (shiftFunctor E n).Additive]
  [Pretriangulated C] [Pretriangulated D] [Pretriangulated E]

/-- A functor which commutes with the shift by `ℤ` is triangulated if
it sends distinguished triangles to distinguished triangles. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Functor/Variantdc7c24665b47d28d8df9b478b29bb19d98dc29bd10a98d21e536bac6f922f32a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Functor/Variantdc7c24665b47d28d8df9b478b29bb19d98dc29bd10a98d21e536bac6f922f32a.lean#L167).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f7502299255e3fe7093047e543456ab66eeaecf2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
