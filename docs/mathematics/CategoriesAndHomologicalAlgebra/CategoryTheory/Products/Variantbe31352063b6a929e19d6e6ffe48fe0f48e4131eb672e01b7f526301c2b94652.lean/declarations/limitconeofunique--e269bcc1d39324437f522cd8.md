## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7ddd6cbf5741a42ff83dc9282f2d8f3439b9bd39803039dd5dbdd8f8ad634ca1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 728–744.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def limitConeOfUnique [Unique β] (f : β → C) : LimitCone (Discrete.functor f) where
  cone :=
    { pt := f default
      π := Discrete.natTrans (fun ⟨j⟩ => eqToHom (by
        dsimp
        congr
        subsingleton)) }
  isLimit :=
    { lift := fun s => s.π.app default
      fac := fun s j => by
        have h := Subsingleton.elim j default
        subst h
        simp
      uniq := fun s m w => by
        specialize w default
        simpa using w }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Products/Variantbe31352063b6a929e19d6e6ffe48fe0f48e4131eb672e01b7f526301c2b94652.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Products/Variantbe31352063b6a929e19d6e6ffe48fe0f48e4131eb672e01b7f526301c2b94652.lean#L728).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6388f8c7a3ed47640ab3cfe274981a6edf8905cf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
