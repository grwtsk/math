## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:02b6f7ec8d70a56866a4061e00da31b8fbfced69ee9964f4fc51a3ff2b98d868`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 748–765.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def colimitCoconeOfUnique [Unique β] (f : β → C) : ColimitCocone (Discrete.functor f) where
  cocone :=
    { pt := f default
      ι := Discrete.natTrans (fun ⟨j⟩ => eqToHom (by
        dsimp
        congr
        subsingleton)) }
  isColimit :=
    { desc := fun s => s.ι.app default
      fac := fun s j => by
        have h := Subsingleton.elim j default
        subst h
        apply Category.id_comp
      uniq := fun s m w => by
        specialize w default
        erw [Category.id_comp] at w
        exact w }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Products/Variant0dc11b9270118a734811c96065659984f95dd82504f6cd1bd5253950d3364557.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Products/Variant0dc11b9270118a734811c96065659984f95dd82504f6cd1bd5253950d3364557.lean#L748).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8c8ebddb92a25b690a254e3470bb72146f10ddff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
