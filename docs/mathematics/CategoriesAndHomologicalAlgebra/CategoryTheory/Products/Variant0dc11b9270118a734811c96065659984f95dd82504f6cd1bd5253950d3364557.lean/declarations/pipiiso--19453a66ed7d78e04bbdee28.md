## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:890dc1997585549111e23c34fcac9a267162081585615908f3137b5a7b54fbac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 574–581.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def piPiIso {ι : Type*} (f : ι → Type*) (g : (i : ι) → (f i) → C)
    [∀ i, HasProduct (g i)] [HasProduct fun i => ∏ᶜ g i] :
    (∏ᶜ fun i => ∏ᶜ g i) ≅ (∏ᶜ fun p : Σ i, f i => g p.1 p.2) where
  hom := Pi.lift fun ⟨i, x⟩ => Pi.π _ i ≫ Pi.π _ x
  inv := Pi.lift fun i => Pi.lift fun x => Pi.π _ (⟨i, x⟩ : Σ i, f i)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Products/Variant0dc11b9270118a734811c96065659984f95dd82504f6cd1bd5253950d3364557.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Products/Variant0dc11b9270118a734811c96065659984f95dd82504f6cd1bd5253950d3364557.lean#L574).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8c8ebddb92a25b690a254e3470bb72146f10ddff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
