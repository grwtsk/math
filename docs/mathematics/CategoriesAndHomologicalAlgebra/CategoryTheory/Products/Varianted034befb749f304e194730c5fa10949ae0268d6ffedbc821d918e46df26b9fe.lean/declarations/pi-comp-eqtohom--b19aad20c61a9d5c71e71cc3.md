## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d72ae99d-fe13-bb79-d71f-3e36120a7f32`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 209–217.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Pi.π_comp_eqToHom (f : J → C) [HasProduct f] {j j' : J} (w : j = j') :
    Pi.π f j ≫ eqToHom (by simp [w]) = Pi.π f j' := by
  cases w
  simp

-- The `simpNF` linter incorrectly identifies these as simp lemmas that could never apply.
-- https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/5049
-- They are used by `simp` in `Sigma.whiskerEquiv` below.
@[reassoc (attr := simp, nolint simpNF)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Products/Varianted034befb749f304e194730c5fa10949ae0268d6ffedbc821d918e46df26b9fe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Products/Varianted034befb749f304e194730c5fa10949ae0268d6ffedbc821d918e46df26b9fe.lean#L209).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `071c9f19c5ee47139c40c81fd5039fa4e9b16456` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
