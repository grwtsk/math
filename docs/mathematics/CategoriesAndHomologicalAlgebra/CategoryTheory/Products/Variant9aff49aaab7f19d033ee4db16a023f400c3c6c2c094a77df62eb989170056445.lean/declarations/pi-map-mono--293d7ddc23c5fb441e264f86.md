## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:621a22ca0e653a0394724bc91a9b1bcfea022f01da560fffd9ab4fd1643f172c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 241–248.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Pi.map_mono {f g : β → C} [HasProduct f] [HasProduct g] (p : ∀ b, f b ⟶ g b)
    [∀ i, Mono (p i)] : Mono <| Pi.map p :=
  @Limits.limMap_mono _ _ _ _ (Discrete.functor f) (Discrete.functor g) _ _
    (Discrete.natTrans fun X => p X.as) (by dsimp; infer_instance)
#align category_theory.limits.pi.map_mono CategoryTheory.Limits.Pi.map_mono

/-- Construct a morphism between categorical products from a family of morphisms between the
    factors. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Products/Variant9aff49aaab7f19d033ee4db16a023f400c3c6c2c094a77df62eb989170056445.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Products/Variant9aff49aaab7f19d033ee4db16a023f400c3c6c2c094a77df62eb989170056445.lean#L241).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e1c7a3692df46db3452b21d48c6f658eb8c28c3f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
