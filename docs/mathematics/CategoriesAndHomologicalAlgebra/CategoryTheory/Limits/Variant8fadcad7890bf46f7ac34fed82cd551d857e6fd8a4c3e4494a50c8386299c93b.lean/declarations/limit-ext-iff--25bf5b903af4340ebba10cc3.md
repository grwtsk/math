## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:54101162-e4e4-1e69-0dd3-a010b6d424ba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 238–247.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem limit_ext_iff' (F : J ⥤ Type v) (x y : limit F) :
    x = y ↔ ∀ j, limit.π F j x = limit.π F j y :=
  ⟨fun t _ => t ▸ rfl, limit_ext' _ _ _⟩

-- TODO: are there other limits lemmas that should have `_apply` versions?
-- Can we generate these like with `@[reassoc]`?
-- PROJECT: prove these for any concrete category where the forgetful functor preserves limits?
-- Porting note (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/11119): @[simp] was removed because the linter said it was useless
--@[simp]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant8fadcad7890bf46f7ac34fed82cd551d857e6fd8a4c3e4494a50c8386299c93b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant8fadcad7890bf46f7ac34fed82cd551d857e6fd8a4c3e4494a50c8386299c93b.lean#L238).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e4ffce443cc038e415c2d179b2fad4c67cd75e7f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
