## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:87635fb55c574e14afd5667206913586f54763263994957863a181563e887592`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 152–174.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def limitConeIsLimit (F : J ⥤ Type max v u) : IsLimit (limitCone F) where
  lift s v :=
    { val := fun j => s.π.app j v
      property := fun f => congr_fun (Cone.w s f) _ }
  uniq := fun _ _ w => by
    funext x
    apply Subtype.ext
    funext j
    exact congr_fun (w j) x

end TypeMax


/-!
The results in this section have a `UnivLE.{v, u}` hypothesis,
but as they only use the constructions from the `CategoryTheory.Limits.Types.UnivLE` namespace
in their definitions (rather than their statements),
we leave them in the main `CategoryTheory.Limits.Types` namespace.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant8fadcad7890bf46f7ac34fed82cd551d857e6fd8a4c3e4494a50c8386299c93b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant8fadcad7890bf46f7ac34fed82cd551d857e6fd8a4c3e4494a50c8386299c93b.lean#L152).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e4ffce443cc038e415c2d179b2fad4c67cd75e7f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
