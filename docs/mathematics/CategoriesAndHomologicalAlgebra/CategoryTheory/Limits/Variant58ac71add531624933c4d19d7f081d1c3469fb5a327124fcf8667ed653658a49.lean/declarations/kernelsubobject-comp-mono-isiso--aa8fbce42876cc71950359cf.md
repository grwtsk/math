## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3f5cfaefede20afc7b2c437c8c11b8755ea0017de91a6765e31b6c8d1f04217c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 204–212.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance kernelSubobject_comp_mono_isIso (f : X ⟶ Y) [HasKernel f] {Z : C} (h : Y ⟶ Z) [Mono h] :
    IsIso (Subobject.ofLE _ _ (kernelSubobject_comp_le f h)) := by
  rw [ofLE_mk_le_mk_of_comm (kernelCompMono f h).inv]

/-- Taking cokernels is an order-reversing map from the subobjects of `X` to the quotient objects
    of `X`. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant58ac71add531624933c4d19d7f081d1c3469fb5a327124fcf8667ed653658a49.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant58ac71add531624933c4d19d7f081d1c3469fb5a327124fcf8667ed653658a49.lean#L204).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cea35513b508501896b1434192340be3bd6a3db6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
