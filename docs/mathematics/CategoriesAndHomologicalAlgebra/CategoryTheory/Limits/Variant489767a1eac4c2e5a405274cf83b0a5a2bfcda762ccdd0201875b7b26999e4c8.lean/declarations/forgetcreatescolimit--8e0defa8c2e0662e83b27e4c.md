## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c67cef32b1a2b3b1445bf34b6fbe0c9eedb09d9adc528d3c26a4cdd8a2098e14`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 226–241.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance forgetCreatesColimit (D : J ⥤ Algebra T)
    [PreservesColimit (D ⋙ forget T) (T : C ⥤ C)]
    [PreservesColimit ((D ⋙ forget T) ⋙ ↑T) (T : C ⥤ C)] : CreatesColimit D (forget T) :=
  createsColimitOfReflectsIso fun c t =>
    { liftedCocone :=
        { pt := coconePoint c t
          ι :=
            { app := fun j =>
                { f := c.ι.app j
                  h := commuting _ _ _ }
              naturality := fun A B f => by
                ext1
                simpa using (c.w f) } }
      validLift := Cocones.ext (Iso.refl _)
      makesColimit := liftedCoconeIsColimit _ _ }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant489767a1eac4c2e5a405274cf83b0a5a2bfcda762ccdd0201875b7b26999e4c8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant489767a1eac4c2e5a405274cf83b0a5a2bfcda762ccdd0201875b7b26999e4c8.lean#L226).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f91b124d1e98a6e9005e55db78b40831d951c7c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
