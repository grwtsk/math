## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6193c094-1380-5faf-5801-03c51a2a3e44`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 486–497.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem commuting (j : J) : lambda c t ≫ (T : C ⥤ C).map (c.π.app j) = c.π.app j ≫ (D.obj j).a :=
  (isLimitOfPreserves _ t).fac (newCone c) j

variable [PreservesLimit ((D ⋙ forget T) ⋙ T.toFunctor) T.toFunctor]
variable [PreservesColimit ((D ⋙ forget T) ⋙ ↑T) (T : C ⥤ C)]

/-- (Impl)
Construct the limiting coalgebra from the map `λ : L ⟶ TL` given by `lambda`. We are required to
show it satisfies the two coalgebra laws, which follow from the coalgebra laws for the image of `D`
and our `commuting` lemma.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant489767a1eac4c2e5a405274cf83b0a5a2bfcda762ccdd0201875b7b26999e4c8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant489767a1eac4c2e5a405274cf83b0a5a2bfcda762ccdd0201875b7b26999e4c8.lean#L486).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f91b124d1e98a6e9005e55db78b40831d951c7c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
