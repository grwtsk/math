## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e1a6e0e8-ff46-2a81-ca39-7398a0cf1889`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 114–136.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasLimit_of_comp_forget_hasLimit (D : J ⥤ Algebra T) [HasLimit (D ⋙ forget T)] :
    HasLimit D :=
  hasLimit_of_created D (forget T)

namespace ForgetCreatesColimits

-- Let's hide the implementation details in a namespace
variable {D : J ⥤ Algebra T} (c : Cocone (D ⋙ forget T)) (t : IsColimit c)

-- We have a diagram D of shape J in the category of algebras, and we assume that we are given a
-- colimit for its image D ⋙ forget T under the forgetful functor, say its point is L.
-- We'll construct a colimiting coalgebra for D, whose carrier will also be L.
-- To do this, we must find a map TL ⟶ L. Since T preserves colimits, TL is also a colimit.
-- In particular, it is a colimit for the diagram `(D ⋙ forget T) ⋙ T`
-- so to construct a map TL ⟶ L it suffices to show that L is the point of a cocone for this
-- diagram. In other words, we need a natural transformation from const L to `(D ⋙ forget T) ⋙ T`.
-- But we already know that L is the point of a cocone for the diagram `D ⋙ forget T`, so it
-- suffices to give a natural transformation `((D ⋙ forget T) ⋙ T) ⟶ (D ⋙ forget T)`:
/-- (Impl)
The natural transformation given by the algebra structure maps, used to construct a cocone `c` with
point `colimit (D ⋙ forget T)`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant489767a1eac4c2e5a405274cf83b0a5a2bfcda762ccdd0201875b7b26999e4c8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant489767a1eac4c2e5a405274cf83b0a5a2bfcda762ccdd0201875b7b26999e4c8.lean#L114).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f91b124d1e98a6e9005e55db78b40831d951c7c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
