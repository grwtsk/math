## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:679eed819ff92405389c0538051bdbc913bc8e62cc076b76b338c44869bce971`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 243–252.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) isEquivalenceCreatesLimits (H : D ⥤ C) [IsEquivalence H] :
    CreatesLimitsOfSize.{v, u} H where
  CreatesLimitsOfShape :=
    { CreatesLimit :=
        { lifts := fun c _ =>
            { liftedCone := mapConeInv H c
              validLift := mapConeMapConeInv H c } } }
#align category_theory.adjunction.is_equivalence_creates_limits CategoryTheory.Adjunction.isEquivalenceCreatesLimits

-- verify the preserve_limits instance works as expected:
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant8f7a3f6a92e8a297735874b348e8bd4854ba1f775f43824d000456616f282b0e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant8f7a3f6a92e8a297735874b348e8bd4854ba1f775f43824d000456616f282b0e.lean#L243).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f83f02b61bc6aaaa0409ee373edf658f5b35a8a2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
