## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5ea79c394edb93986e4a61183b7f5a8c62b6e2b98efd40f518614862dd77d52a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 63–68.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance limitMonoid :
    Monoid (Types.Small.limitCone.{v, u} (F ⋙ forget MonCat.{u})).pt :=
  inferInstanceAs <| Monoid (Shrink (F ⋙ forget MonCat.{u}).sections)

/-- `limit.π (F ⋙ forget MonCat) j` as a `MonoidHom`. -/
@[to_additive "`limit.π (F ⋙ forget AddMonCat) j` as an `AddMonoidHom`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variantbe48f66b37697a3e458135ab88541ba7719a16dd0cad4ba8f7d9d5b6ca915697.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variantbe48f66b37697a3e458135ab88541ba7719a16dd0cad4ba8f7d9d5b6ca915697.lean#L63).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2275a8f6c561dbb658f3bcc1897ca0e29e539359` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
