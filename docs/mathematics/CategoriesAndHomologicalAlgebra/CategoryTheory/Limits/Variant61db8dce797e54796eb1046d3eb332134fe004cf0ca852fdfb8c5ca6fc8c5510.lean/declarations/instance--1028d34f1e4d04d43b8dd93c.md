## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2c952ef1a8ef678b7804f2c0eccf2dbddfe1a4b8a3a306f79f4814e582e48d47`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–67.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {J : Type*} {A B : J → C} [HasProduct A] [HasProduct B]
    (f : (j : J) → A j ⟶ B j) {X Y : C} (p : X ⟶ Y)
    [∀ j, HasLiftingProperty p (f j)] :
    HasLiftingProperty p (Limits.Pi.map f) where
  sq_hasLift {t b} sq := by
    have sq' (j : J) :
        CommSq (t ≫ Pi.π _ j) p (f j) (b ≫ Pi.π _ j) :=
      ⟨by rw [← Category.assoc, ← sq.w]; simp⟩
    exact ⟨⟨{ l := Pi.lift (fun j ↦ (sq' j).lift) }⟩⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant61db8dce797e54796eb1046d3eb332134fe004cf0ca852fdfb8c5ca6fc8c5510.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant61db8dce797e54796eb1046d3eb332134fe004cf0ca852fdfb8c5ca6fc8c5510.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb1c478cdd17dd18acfb4d8dc79c20229727e825` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
