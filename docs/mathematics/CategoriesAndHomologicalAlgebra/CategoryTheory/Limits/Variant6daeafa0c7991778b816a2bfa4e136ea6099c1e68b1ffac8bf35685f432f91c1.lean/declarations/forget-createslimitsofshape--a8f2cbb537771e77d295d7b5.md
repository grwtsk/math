## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ad760cf96ce0d8136a26f723a7cfa3d049c1595078ef8a04dc2617640a79dedb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 432–440.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance forget_createsLimitsOfShape (J : Type v) [Category.{w} J] :
    CreatesLimitsOfShape J (forget CommGrp.{u}) where
  CreatesLimit := inferInstance

/-- The forgetful functor from commutative groups to types creates all limits.

  "The forgetful functor from additive commutative groups to types creates all limits.",
  to_additive_relevant_arg 2]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant6daeafa0c7991778b816a2bfa4e136ea6099c1e68b1ffac8bf35685f432f91c1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant6daeafa0c7991778b816a2bfa4e136ea6099c1e68b1ffac8bf35685f432f91c1.lean#L432).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6eea41ba0294d30b1d45b8bdb67a627bb203e942` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
