## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:677732bf-4a72-fd53-29bd-2682aa0cc8f6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 696–709.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma coproducts_monotone : Monotone (coproducts.{w} (C := C)) := by
  rintro W₁ W₂ h X Y f hf
  rw [coproducts_iff] at hf
  obtain ⟨J, hf⟩ := hf
  exact W₂.colimitsOfShape_le_coproducts J _
    (colimitsOfShape_monotone h _ _ hf)

end Coproducts

section Products

variable (W : MorphismProperty C)

/-- The property that a morphism property `W` is stable under products indexed by a type `J`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variante1e4df6baf7d644be7b4b0862056b95dd6d0f264588c6c2dedeaa4100142c086.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variante1e4df6baf7d644be7b4b0862056b95dd6d0f264588c6c2dedeaa4100142c086.lean#L696).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
