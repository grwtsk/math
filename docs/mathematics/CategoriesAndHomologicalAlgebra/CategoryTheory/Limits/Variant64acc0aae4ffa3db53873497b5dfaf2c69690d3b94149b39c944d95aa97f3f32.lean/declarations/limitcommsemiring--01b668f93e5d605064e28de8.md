## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ed96e08be1936dcd1ee2064b681b3d3ac74b5b214baad09d50610a0b1aa54895`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 201–212.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance limitCommSemiring :
    CommSemiring (Types.Small.limitCone.{v, u} (F ⋙ forget CommSemiRingCat.{u})).pt :=
  let _ : CommSemiring (F ⋙ forget CommSemiRingCat.{u}).sections :=
    @Subsemiring.toCommSemiring (∀ j, F.obj j) _
      (SemiRingCat.sectionsSubsemiring.{v, u} (F ⋙ forget₂ CommSemiRingCat.{u} SemiRingCat.{u}))
  inferInstanceAs <| CommSemiring (Shrink (F ⋙ forget CommSemiRingCat.{u}).sections)

/-- We show that the forgetful functor `CommSemiRingCat ⥤ SemiRingCat` creates limits.

All we need to do is notice that the limit point has a `CommSemiring` instance available,
and then reuse the existing limit.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant64acc0aae4ffa3db53873497b5dfaf2c69690d3b94149b39c944d95aa97f3f32.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Limits/Variant64acc0aae4ffa3db53873497b5dfaf2c69690d3b94149b39c944d95aa97f3f32.lean#L201).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1e7875a013767b81c7033db8a202723471ef5de5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
