## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1f9264f46931139bbd1905a7e3fbe2c7d79af2281b8ce82a6a2c2f3776f80715`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–96.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance M.Path.inhabited (x : P.last.M) {i} [Inhabited (P.drop.B x.head i)] :
    Inhabited (M.Path P x i) :=
  let a := PFunctor.M.head x
  let f := PFunctor.M.children x
  ⟨M.Path.root _ a f
      (PFunctor.M.casesOn' x
        (r := fun _ => PFunctor.M.dest x = ⟨a, f⟩)
        <| by
        intros; simp [PFunctor.M.dest_mk, PFunctor.M.children_mk]; rfl)
      _ default⟩

#align mvpfunctor.M.path.inhabited MvPFunctor.M.Path.inhabited

/-- Polynomial functor of the M-type of `P`. `A` is a data-less
possibly infinite tree whereas, for a given `a : A`, `B a` is a valid
path in tree `a` so that `mp.Obj α` is made of a tree and a function
from its valid paths to the values it contains -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/M/Variant752396bcaf80a473d306cb55d0c65e4531446b3684e6486b436c3c9e87ea6729.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/M/Variant752396bcaf80a473d306cb55d0c65e4531446b3684e6486b436c3c9e87ea6729.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `262d6118784c59493f44f05d67bb5c6d102535fb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
