## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4add300180e3a76e83665a3861b8e61c3a1fa92e001b5b22a5b1b6cd97406d2a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 203–224.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isLocallyInjective_toSheafify' {CD : D → Type (max u v)}
    [∀ X Y, FunLike (FD X Y) (CD X) (CD Y)] [ConcreteCategory.{max u v} D FD]
    (P : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ D) [HasWeakSheafify J D] [J.HasSheafCompose (forget D)]
    [J.PreservesSheafification (forget D)] :
    IsLocallyInjective J (toSheafify J P) := by
  rw [← isLocallyInjective_forget_iff, ← sheafComposeIso_hom_fac,
    ← toSheafify_plusPlusIsoSheafify_hom]
  infer_instance

end

end Presheaf

namespace Sheaf

variable {J}
variable {F₁ F₂ : Sheaf J D} (φ : F₁ ⟶ F₂)

/-- If `φ : F₁ ⟶ F₂` is a morphism of sheaves, this is an abbreviation for
`Presheaf.IsLocallyInjective J φ.val`. Under suitable assumptions, it
is equivalent to the injectivity of all maps `φ.val.app X`,
see `isLocallyInjective_iff_injective`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LocallyInjective/Variant25bf1e3f641dfceed735f9a15ac0e37454d785adaed3ab0ca84a210ea3f74d51.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LocallyInjective/Variant25bf1e3f641dfceed735f9a15ac0e37454d785adaed3ab0ca84a210ea3f74d51.lean#L203).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e33120e0ab9ecd7f9fe21a4b69a1ff430a8cea13` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
