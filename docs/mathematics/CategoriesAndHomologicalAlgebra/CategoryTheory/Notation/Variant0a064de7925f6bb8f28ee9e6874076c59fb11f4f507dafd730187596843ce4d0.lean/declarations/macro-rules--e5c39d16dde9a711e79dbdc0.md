## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `macro_rules` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:12e8d5d2d12bbb913568bcc08e61911dcbd8e3cd635d25409a4c3edf245c9ce3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 373–388.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
macro_rules | `($x <= $y)  => `(binrel% LE.le $x $y)

@[inherit_doc] infix:50 unicode(" ≤ ", " <= ") => LE.le
@[inherit_doc] infix:50 " < "                  => LT.lt
@[inherit_doc] infix:50 unicode(" ≥ ", " >= ") => GE.ge
@[inherit_doc] infix:50 " > "                  => GT.gt
@[inherit_doc] infix:50 " = "                  => Eq
@[inherit_doc] infix:50 " == "                 => BEq.beq
@[inherit_doc] infix:50 " ≍ "                  => HEq

/-!
  Remark: the infix commands above ensure a delaborator is generated for each relations.
  We redefine the macros below to be able to use the auxiliary `binrel%` elaboration helper for binary relations.
  It has better support for applying coercions. For example, suppose we have `binrel% Eq n i` where `n : Nat` and
  `i : Int`. The default elaborator fails because we don't have a coercion from `Int` to `Nat`, but
  `binrel%` succeeds because it also tries a coercion from `Nat` to `Int` even when the nat occurs before the int. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Notation/Variant0a064de7925f6bb8f28ee9e6874076c59fb11f4f507dafd730187596843ce4d0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Notation/Variant0a064de7925f6bb8f28ee9e6874076c59fb11f4f507dafd730187596843ce4d0.lean#L373).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6a86d3cb0f9ffbd1bed45fb6a41f33bb895121bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
