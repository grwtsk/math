## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c4e42f8e-6dd2-4184-20db-2a638278f3e9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 158–179.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma postcomp_bijective_of_weakEquivalence
    [IsCofibrant X] (g : Y ⟶ Z) [IsFibrant Y] [IsFibrant Z] [WeakEquivalence g] :
    Function.Bijective (fun (f : LeftHomotopyClass X Y) ↦ f.postcomp g) := by
  let h : FibrantBrownFactorization g := Classical.arbitrary _
  have hi : Function.Bijective (fun (f : LeftHomotopyClass X Y) ↦ f.postcomp h.i) := by
    rw [← Function.Bijective.of_comp_iff'
      (postcomp_bijective_of_fibration_of_weakEquivalence X h.r)]
    convert! Function.bijective_id
    ext φ
    obtain ⟨φ, rfl⟩ := φ.mk_surjective
    simp
  convert! (postcomp_bijective_of_fibration_of_weakEquivalence X h.p).comp hi using 1
  ext φ
  obtain ⟨φ, rfl⟩ := φ.mk_surjective

variable (Z)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Homotopy/Variant8ef6b4d69b6a271ed74d68a4f1f0e615f010c4e4586da29099a0608b140cbb4b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Homotopy/Variant8ef6b4d69b6a271ed74d68a4f1f0e615f010c4e4586da29099a0608b140cbb4b.lean#L158).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a1d0d9d5da01223327b017e5e0f86ad0a5ddf7e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
