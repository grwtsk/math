## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b2d369480219c351a3439efa94f0d87d8600aefc965368e0bca3bcdd21f0ed4a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 389–398.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def homMk {U V : Under X} (f : U.right ⟶ V.right) (w : U.hom ≫ f = V.hom := by aesop_cat) : U ⟶ V :=
  StructuredArrow.homMk f w
#align category_theory.under.hom_mk CategoryTheory.Under.homMk

-- Porting note: simp solves this; simpNF still sees them after `-simp` (?)
attribute [-simp, nolint simpNF] homMk_left_down_down

/-- Construct an isomorphism in the over category given isomorphisms of the objects whose forward
direction gives a commutative triangle.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Over/Variant3b20ae2044e894646d61d0d72cf3b68617620a2351834a21cfba28a9fb6d434c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Over/Variant3b20ae2044e894646d61d0d72cf3b68617620a2351834a21cfba28a9fb6d434c.lean#L389).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `82848c85450307796cc452080aed7f7cf96fb646` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
