## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:61a65cb090ef6d0c52c61fa8e0b64cf3c416ab5a33ccf1d0591f6a729f742bb6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 566–579.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def isEquivalenceToUnder (X : T) (F : D ⥤ T) [IsEquivalence F] :
    IsEquivalence (toUnder X F) :=
  StructuredArrow.isEquivalencePre _ _ _

end StructuredArrow

namespace Functor

variable {S : Type u₂} [Category.{v₂} S]

/-- Given `X : T`, to upgrade a functor `F : S ⥤ T` to a functor `S ⥤ Over X`, it suffices to
    provide maps `F.obj Y ⟶ X` for all `Y` making the obvious triangles involving all `F.map g`
    commute. -/
@[simps! obj_left map_left]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Over/Variant3b20ae2044e894646d61d0d72cf3b68617620a2351834a21cfba28a9fb6d434c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Over/Variant3b20ae2044e894646d61d0d72cf3b68617620a2351834a21cfba28a9fb6d434c.lean#L566).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `82848c85450307796cc452080aed7f7cf96fb646` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
