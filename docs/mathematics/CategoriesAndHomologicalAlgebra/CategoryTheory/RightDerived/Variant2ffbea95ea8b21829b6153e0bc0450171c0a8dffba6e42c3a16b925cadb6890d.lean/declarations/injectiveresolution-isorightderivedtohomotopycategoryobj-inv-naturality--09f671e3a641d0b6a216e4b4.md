## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a3acada2-986c-8f25-7313-2591c85c66b2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 104–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma InjectiveResolution.isoRightDerivedToHomotopyCategoryObj_inv_naturality
    {X Y : C} (f : X ⟶ Y) (I : InjectiveResolution X) (J : InjectiveResolution Y)
    (φ : I.cocomplex ⟶ J.cocomplex) (comm : I.ι.f 0 ≫ φ.f 0 = f ≫ J.ι.f 0)
    (F : C ⥤ D) [F.Additive] :
    (I.isoRightDerivedToHomotopyCategoryObj F).inv ≫ F.rightDerivedToHomotopyCategory.map f =
      (F.mapHomologicalComplex _ ⋙ HomotopyCategory.quotient _ _).map φ ≫
        (J.isoRightDerivedToHomotopyCategoryObj F).inv := by
    rw [← cancel_epi (I.isoRightDerivedToHomotopyCategoryObj F).hom, Iso.hom_inv_id_assoc]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/RightDerived/Variant2ffbea95ea8b21829b6153e0bc0450171c0a8dffba6e42c3a16b925cadb6890d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/RightDerived/Variant2ffbea95ea8b21829b6153e0bc0450171c0a8dffba6e42c3a16b925cadb6890d.lean#L104).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ef9aab66aff1d402a134a5ad19ee15776504f5da` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
