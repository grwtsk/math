## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:359c47a1b396b88157bb25c0e7090f76135d6380a4072feaced51efeaeb5b8d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–105.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure MayerVietorisSquare [HasWeakSheafify J (Type v)] extends Square C where
  mono_f₁₃ : Mono toSquare.f₁₃ := by infer_instance
  /-- the square becomes a pushout square in the category of sheaves of types -/
  isPushout : (toSquare.map (yoneda ⋙ presheafToSheaf J _)).IsPushout

namespace MayerVietorisSquare

attribute [instance] mono_f₁₃

variable {J}

section

variable [HasWeakSheafify J (Type v)]

/-- Constructor for Mayer-Vietoris squares taking as an input
a square `sq` such that `sq.f₁₃` is a mono and that for every
sheaf of types `F`, the square `sq.op.map F.val` is a pullback square. -/
@[simps toSquare]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/MayerVietorisSquare/Variant4feca5f3115207eea686e2ca25686d0e58d9eb9cfef2bf4461b80127c2de56e6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/MayerVietorisSquare/Variant4feca5f3115207eea686e2ca25686d0e58d9eb9cfef2bf4461b80127c2de56e6.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3302e424376100639903431669120916ca3655a0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
