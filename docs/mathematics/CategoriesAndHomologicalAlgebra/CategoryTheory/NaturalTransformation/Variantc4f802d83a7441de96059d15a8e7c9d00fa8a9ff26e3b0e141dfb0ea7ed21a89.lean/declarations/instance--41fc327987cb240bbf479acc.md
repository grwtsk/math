## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:558d71712be3c2601624b508795778a25b80178e5499b1357d2707789feeb231`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 95–105.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (F : C ⥤ D) (G : D ⥤ E) (H : E ⥤ E') [F.LaxMonoidal] [G.LaxMonoidal] [H.LaxMonoidal] :
    NatTrans.IsMonoidal (Functor.associator F G H).hom where
  unit := by
    simp only [comp_obj, comp_ε, assoc, Functor.map_comp, associator_hom_app, comp_id,
      Functor.comp_map]
  tensor X Y := by
    simp only [comp_obj, comp_μ, associator_hom_app, Functor.comp_map, map_comp,
      comp_id, tensorHom_id, id_whiskerRight, assoc, id_comp]

end IsMonoidal

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NaturalTransformation/Variantc4f802d83a7441de96059d15a8e7c9d00fa8a9ff26e3b0e141dfb0ea7ed21a89.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NaturalTransformation/Variantc4f802d83a7441de96059d15a8e7c9d00fa8a9ff26e3b0e141dfb0ea7ed21a89.lean#L95).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ab04785d4920da3dd41ec6d8fc24dd0a210ce37d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
