## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1aca1b19-8d62-9a66-5c99-cbf4feb66584`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 157–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma hCompVCompHComp (w₁ : TwoSquare T L R B) (w₂ : TwoSquare T' R R' B')
    (w₃ : TwoSquare B L' R'' B'') (w₄ : TwoSquare B' R'' R₃ B₃) :
    (w₁ ≫ₕ w₂) ≫ᵥ (w₃ ≫ₕ w₄) = (w₁ ≫ᵥ w₃) ≫ₕ (w₂ ≫ᵥ w₄) := by
  unfold hComp vComp whiskerLeft whiskerRight
  ext c
  simp only [Functor.comp_obj, NatTrans.comp_app, Functor.associator_hom_app,
    Functor.associator_inv_app, comp_id, id_comp, Functor.map_comp, assoc]
  slice_rhs 2 3 =>
    rw [← Functor.comp_map _ B₃, ← w₄.naturality]
  simp

end Interchange

end TwoSquare

end CategoryTheory
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/TwoSquare/Variantc4dac7138d3af2f202aa38e7039cc66649281a7163a68592a380343e8f78a4f3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/TwoSquare/Variantc4dac7138d3af2f202aa38e7039cc66649281a7163a68592a380343e8f78a4f3.lean#L157).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fcef7afa2290577698a8e01970e124df6cebf114` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
