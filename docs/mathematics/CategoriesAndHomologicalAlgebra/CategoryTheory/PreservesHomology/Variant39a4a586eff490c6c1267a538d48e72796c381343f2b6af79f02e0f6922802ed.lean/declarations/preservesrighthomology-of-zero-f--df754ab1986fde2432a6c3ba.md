## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f92c02e9-f9cd-30b7-a6ff-f868b81b15b7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 863–876.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma preservesRightHomology_of_zero_f (hf : S.f = 0)
    [PreservesLimit (parallelPair S.g 0) F] :
    F.PreservesRightHomologyOf S := ⟨fun h =>
  { f := by
      rw [hf]
      infer_instance
    g' := by
      have := h.isIso_p hf
      let e : parallelPair S.g 0 ≅ parallelPair h.g' 0 :=
        parallelPair.ext (asIso h.p) (Iso.refl _) (by simp) (by simp)
      exact Limits.preservesLimit_of_iso_diagram F e }⟩

end Functor

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/PreservesHomology/Variant39a4a586eff490c6c1267a538d48e72796c381343f2b6af79f02e0f6922802ed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/PreservesHomology/Variant39a4a586eff490c6c1267a538d48e72796c381343f2b6af79f02e0f6922802ed.lean#L863).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c53ed2687c6b810a2f1c343491d7c1fa066529eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
