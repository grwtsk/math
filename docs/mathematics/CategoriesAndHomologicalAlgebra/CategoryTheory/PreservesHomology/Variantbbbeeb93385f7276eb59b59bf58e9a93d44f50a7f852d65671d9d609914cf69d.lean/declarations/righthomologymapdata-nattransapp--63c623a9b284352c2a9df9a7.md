## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9c585523f88704bd6ea469146131f6e40b6ff99fa53c205ce7a7cf631fbde45e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 708–717.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def RightHomologyMapData.natTransApp (h : RightHomologyData S) (τ : F ⟶ G) :
    RightHomologyMapData (S.mapNatTrans τ) (h.map F) (h.map G) where
  φQ := τ.app h.Q
  φH := τ.app h.H

/-- Given a natural transformation `τ : F ⟶ G` between functors `C ⥤ D` which preserve
the homology of a short complex `S`, and a homology data for `S`,
this is the homology map data for the morphism `S.mapNatTrans τ`
obtained by evaluating `τ`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/PreservesHomology/Variantbbbeeb93385f7276eb59b59bf58e9a93d44f50a7f852d65671d9d609914cf69d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/PreservesHomology/Variantbbbeeb93385f7276eb59b59bf58e9a93d44f50a7f852d65671d9d609914cf69d.lean#L708).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e9ba1cf42c53d58773a6d6574ce5a0f6f4154b67` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
