## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6f40c128c82aed326b435f5115a9ed46100ff70d9e1bce10dec78d8fcd8f41ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 67–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance monoCoprod [IsCartesianDistributive C] : MonoCoprod C :=
  MonoCoprod.mk' fun A B =>
    ⟨_, coprodIsCoprod A B, ⟨fun {Z} f g he ↦ by
      let ι := coprod.inl (X := A) (Y := B)
      have : Mono (Z ◁ ι) := SplitMono.mono
        { retraction := (∂L Z A B).inv ≫ coprod.desc (𝟙 _) (fst Z B ≫ lift (𝟙 Z) f) }
      have : lift (𝟙 Z) f = lift (𝟙 Z) g := by rw [← cancel_mono (Z ◁ ι)]; aesop
      simpa only [lift_snd] using this =≫ snd _ _⟩⟩

end IsCartesianDistributive

end CategoryTheory
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Cartesian/Variant2018ecfed8c6a2a8f031a9cb7c64ea152c8ad195f40cf1304ca964fe6688ff4a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Cartesian/Variant2018ecfed8c6a2a8f031a9cb7c64ea152c8ad195f40cf1304ca964fe6688ff4a.lean#L67).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c49533e75cc1bf6e05868106e6d6284bd25814ed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
