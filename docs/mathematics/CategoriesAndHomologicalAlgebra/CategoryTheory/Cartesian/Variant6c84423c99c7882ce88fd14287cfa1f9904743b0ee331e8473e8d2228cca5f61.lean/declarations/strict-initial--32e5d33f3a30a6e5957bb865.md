## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:54c801bc-578a-37c0-525a-f6185d54f8e1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 379–385.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem strict_initial {I : C} (t : IsInitial I) (f : A ⟶ I) : IsIso f := by
  haveI : Mono (prod.lift (𝟙 A) f ≫ (zeroMul t).hom) := mono_comp _ _
  rw [zeroMul_hom, prod.lift_snd] at this
  haveI : IsSplitEpi f := IsSplitEpi.mk' ⟨t.to _, t.hom_ext _ _⟩
  apply isIso_of_mono_of_isSplitEpi
#align category_theory.strict_initial CategoryTheory.strict_initial

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Cartesian/Variant6c84423c99c7882ce88fd14287cfa1f9904743b0ee331e8473e8d2228cca5f61.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Cartesian/Variant6c84423c99c7882ce88fd14287cfa1f9904743b0ee331e8473e8d2228cca5f61.lean#L379).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b5cec0fec095510a1004cebef8b6ccb7f8bc2732` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
