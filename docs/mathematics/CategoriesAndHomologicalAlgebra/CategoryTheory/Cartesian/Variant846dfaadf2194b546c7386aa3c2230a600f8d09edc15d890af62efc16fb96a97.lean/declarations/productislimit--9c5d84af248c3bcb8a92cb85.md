## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:644157711dc2575a9b20c91d9d83a101c523339ba1c4da8f703f2bdffd00911c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 48–62.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def productIsLimit : IsLimit (productCone X Y) := by
  refine BinaryFan.isLimitMk (fun s ↦ ofHom _ { toFun x := (s.fst x, s.snd x) })
    (by rfl_cat) (by rfl_cat) fun _ _ h₁ h₂ ↦ ?_
  ext x
  exacts [ConcreteCategory.congr_hom h₁ _, ConcreteCategory.congr_hom h₂ _]

/--
When the predicate `P` is preserved under taking type-theoretic products and `PUnit` satisfies it,
then `CompHausLike P` is a cartesian monoidal category.

This could be an instance but that causes some slowness issues with typeclass search, therefore we
keep it as a def and turn it on as an instance for the explicit examples of `CompHausLike` as
needed.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Cartesian/Variant846dfaadf2194b546c7386aa3c2230a600f8d09edc15d890af62efc16fb96a97.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Cartesian/Variant846dfaadf2194b546c7386aa3c2230a600f8d09edc15d890af62efc16fb96a97.lean#L48).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a6ccce31c320b3d99646737089275b5ae75017c2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
