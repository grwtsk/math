## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c8ad0c5c-848e-0094-c035-b9733de09c8e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 148–164.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma weakEquivalence_iff [(weakEquivalences C).HasTwoOutOfThreeProperty]
    [(weakEquivalences C).ContainsIdentities]
    {f₀ f₁ : X ⟶ Y} (h : P.LeftHomotopy f₀ f₁) :
    WeakEquivalence f₀ ↔ WeakEquivalence f₁ := by
  induction h
  grind [weakEquivalence_precomp_iff]

end

section

variable [ModelCategory C] {P : Cylinder X}

/-- If `f₀ : X ⟶ Y` is homotopic to `f₁` relative to a cylinder `P`,
and `f₁` is homotopic to `f₂` relative to a good cylinder `P'`,
then `f₀` is homotopic to `f₂` relative to the cylinder `P.trans P'`
when `X` is cofibrant. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LeftHomotopy/Variantd4b80716bd863fac58b79ef184ecf8ea3ea2a1dda47e9d24a301dc7c2779fe81.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LeftHomotopy/Variantd4b80716bd863fac58b79ef184ecf8ea3ea2a1dda47e9d24a301dc7c2779fe81.lean#L148).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1046608a44462dfda1e5889e6f8d38f669fa07c5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
