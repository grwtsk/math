## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cf68642c86726a92c4fdeb351b0038b6919144c9e3c7f437afd6fb07c0f9ce3b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 151–165.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def homEquivOfIso {V W : Quiv} (e : V ≅ W) {X Y : V} :
    (X ⟶ Y) ≃ (e.hom.obj X ⟶ e.hom.obj Y) where
  toFun f := e.hom.map f
  invFun g := Quiver.homOfEq (e.inv.map g) (by simp) (by simp)
  left_inv f := by simp [inv_map_hom_map_of_iso]
  right_inv g := by simp [hom_map_inv_map_of_iso]

end

section
variable {V W : Type u} [Quiver V] [Quiver W]
  (e : V ≃ W) (he : ∀ X Y : V, (X ⟶ Y) ≃ (e X ⟶ e Y))

include he in
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Quiv/Variant3f783eefd14eddc6462ba77b13cf91771750bf1cd7ee2ae23c60a6ca84215280.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Quiv/Variant3f783eefd14eddc6462ba77b13cf91771750bf1cd7ee2ae23c60a6ca84215280.lean#L151).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3f9d41ac0926df235cd7d267af405558cf8e6c9c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
