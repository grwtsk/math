## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:584a9167dbe2af24035a9277b25124576fe47bc6fef2a697e3961c0bef0b1a0d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 121–135.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def free : Quiv.{v, u} ⥤ Cat.{max u v, u} where
  obj V := Cat.of (Paths V)
  map F := Functor.toCatHom (freeMap (Prefunctor.ofQuivHom F))
  map_id _ := freeMap_id _
  map_comp _ _ := freeMap_comp _ _

end Cat

namespace Quiv

section
variable {V W : Quiv} (e : V ≅ W)

/-- An isomorphism of quivers defines an equivalence on carrier types. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Quiv/Variantdb97d8285cb944c8d42af4f064395a1a317ee10bb4615f0c9cac8f23d66547b3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Quiv/Variantdb97d8285cb944c8d42af4f064395a1a317ee10bb4615f0c9cac8f23d66547b3.lean#L121).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `41fbabdc3a6f0245ecf47fbd658d8df723f5201a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
