## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:da3bd88d4476314b9efccf49a90dbe3b5eeb0df5f9751c7998b6cee127c0446d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 977–989.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def RightHomologyMapData.op {S₁ S₂ : ShortComplex C} {φ : S₁ ⟶ S₂}
    {h₁ : S₁.RightHomologyData} {h₂ : S₂.RightHomologyData}
    (ψ : RightHomologyMapData φ h₁ h₂) : LeftHomologyMapData (opMap φ) h₂.op h₁.op where
  φK := ψ.φQ.op
  φH := ψ.φH.op
  commi := Quiver.Hom.unop_inj (by simp)
  commf' := Quiver.Hom.unop_inj (by simp)
  commπ := Quiver.Hom.unop_inj (by simp)

induces a left homology map data in the original category. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/RightHomology/Variant36305292f29ec1870be84d907137757b7cb7eb55a1e5638d8092712be80128e5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/RightHomology/Variant36305292f29ec1870be84d907137757b7cb7eb55a1e5638d8092712be80128e5.lean#L977).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `db7db3eb3f9bc867e623dbeaff836577df828c1e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
