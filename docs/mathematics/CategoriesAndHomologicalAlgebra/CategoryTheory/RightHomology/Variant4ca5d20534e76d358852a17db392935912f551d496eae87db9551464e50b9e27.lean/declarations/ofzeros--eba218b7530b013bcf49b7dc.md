## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:def73d9f883bff22ef018299c4abaef0d121354a338f4d94c317ee1b92f92d47`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 417–427.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofZeros (φ : S₁ ⟶ S₂) (hf₁ : S₁.f = 0) (hg₁ : S₁.g = 0) (hf₂ : S₂.f = 0) (hg₂ : S₂.g = 0) :
    RightHomologyMapData φ (RightHomologyData.ofZeros S₁ hf₁ hg₁)
    (RightHomologyData.ofZeros S₂ hf₂ hg₂) where
  φQ := φ.τ₂
  φH := φ.τ₂

/-- When `S₁.f` and `S₂.f` are zero and we have chosen limit kernel forks `c₁` and `c₂`
for `S₁.g` and `S₂.g` respectively, the action on right homology of a morphism `φ : S₁ ⟶ S₂` of
short complexes is given by the unique morphism `f : c₁.pt ⟶ c₂.pt` such that
`c₁.ι ≫ φ.τ₂ = f ≫ c₂.ι`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/RightHomology/Variant4ca5d20534e76d358852a17db392935912f551d496eae87db9551464e50b9e27.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/RightHomology/Variant4ca5d20534e76d358852a17db392935912f551d496eae87db9551464e50b9e27.lean#L417).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4fcb7659442823c717f16e4ac90ce532df05a6f0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
