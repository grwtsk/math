## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5ef05e629c5818ea461a48288e960b7dd968e6da3c2309e76ae9676ad5436023`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–59.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class RegularMono (f : X ⟶ Y) where
  /-- An object in `C` -/
  Z : C -- Porting note: violates naming but what is better?
  /-- A map from the codomain of `f` to `Z` -/
  left : Y ⟶ Z
  /-- Another map from the codomain of `f` to `Z` -/
  right : Y ⟶ Z
  /-- `f` equalizes the two maps -/
  w : f ≫ left = f ≫ right := by aesop_cat
  /-- `f` is the equalizer of the two maps -/
  isLimit : IsLimit (Fork.ofι f w)
#align category_theory.regular_mono CategoryTheory.RegularMono

attribute [reassoc] RegularMono.w

/-- Every regular monomorphism is a monomorphism. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/RegularMono/Variant5a96362c05bb5c20a4ccef729ffe8a0f6d9d9e9889495a3c48acbae4ffc7a98c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/RegularMono/Variant5a96362c05bb5c20a4ccef729ffe8a0f6d9d9e9889495a3c48acbae4ffc7a98c.lean#L44).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b9b2f2adffe0b032141ce6c09aeeaaee17971415` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
