## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f8f99d1c5087dc769e1efec0d43a88eae249e0c442295042e517115579516910`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 447–455.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mapConeEquiv {D : Type u₄} [Category.{v₄} D] {K : J ⥤ C} {F G : C ⥤ D} (h : F ≅ G) {c : Cone K}
    (t : IsLimit (mapCone F c)) : IsLimit (mapCone G c) := by
  apply postcomposeInvEquiv (isoWhiskerLeft K h : _) (mapCone G c) _
  apply t.ofIsoLimit (postcomposeWhiskerLeftMapCone h.symm c).symm
#align category_theory.limits.is_limit.map_cone_equiv CategoryTheory.Limits.IsLimit.mapConeEquiv

/-- A cone is a limit cone exactly if
there is a unique cone morphism from any other cone.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsLimit/Variantb2cd32405c940b31413460701aabe8915ef9c506a78feccbc9881b443bf2eff7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsLimit/Variantb2cd32405c940b31413460701aabe8915ef9c506a78feccbc9881b443bf2eff7.lean#L447).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `99af3ae8c3414304087b513eee2b9dc541385cae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
