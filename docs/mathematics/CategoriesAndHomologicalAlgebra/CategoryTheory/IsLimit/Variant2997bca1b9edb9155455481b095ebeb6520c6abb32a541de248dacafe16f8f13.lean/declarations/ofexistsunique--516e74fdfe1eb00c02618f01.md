## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:077c59c4079a337b651c8bf44dfc5dde1a29987d880e79fef88cea7fcf600fb5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–106.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofExistsUnique {t : Cone F}
    (ht : ∀ s : Cone F, ∃! l : s.pt ⟶ t.pt, ∀ j, l ≫ t.π.app j = s.π.app j) : IsLimit t := by
  choose s hs hs' using ht
  exact ⟨s, hs, hs'⟩

/-- Alternative constructor for `isLimit`,
providing a morphism of cones rather than a morphism between the cone points
and separately the factorisation condition.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsLimit/Variant2997bca1b9edb9155455481b095ebeb6520c6abb32a541de248dacafe16f8f13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsLimit/Variant2997bca1b9edb9155455481b095ebeb6520c6abb32a541de248dacafe16f8f13.lean#L97).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c70b049a4643c6087688e0c4fff0102f2efff044` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
