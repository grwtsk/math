## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b08fdc65b5ab6bac638cacb5ea86e0f0a7493e6ae312fa112651514069742445`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 327–337.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def equivOfNatIsoOfIso {F G : J ⥤ C} (α : F ≅ G) (c : Cone F) (d : Cone G)
    (w : (Cone.postcompose α.hom).obj c ≅ d) : IsLimit c ≃ IsLimit d :=
  (postcomposeHomEquiv α _).symm.trans (equivIsoLimit w)

/-- The cone points of two limit cones for naturally isomorphic functors
are themselves isomorphic.
-/
@[to_dual (attr := simps)
/-- The cocone points of two colimit cocones for naturally isomorphic functors
are themselves isomorphic.
-/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsLimit/Variantb98c1fdd6ce5415360b6acae4a2c7c0de1d52312dca2e0c103d62f0067fd5b9a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsLimit/Variantb98c1fdd6ce5415360b6acae4a2c7c0de1d52312dca2e0c103d62f0067fd5b9a.lean#L327).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d260a878bda7df2fded444d9b58e9d08a2efa058` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
