## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ce081c0d8a668df0177801d2676e78dff83fd444aac45ecadcec3d79393180d9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 59–71.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure IsLimit (t : Cone F) where
  /-- There is a morphism from any cone point to `t.pt` -/
  lift : ∀ s : Cone F, s.pt ⟶ t.pt
  /-- The map makes the triangle with the two natural transformations commute -/
  fac : ∀ (s : Cone F) (j : J), lift s ≫ t.π.app j = s.π.app j := by aesop_cat
  /-- It is the unique such map to do this -/
  uniq : ∀ (s : Cone F) (m : s.pt ⟶ t.pt) (_ : ∀ j : J, m ≫ t.π.app j = s.π.app j), m = lift s := by
    aesop_cat

attribute [reassoc (attr := simp)] IsLimit.fac

namespace IsLimit

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsLimit/Varianta0c3a5595cef9b0c42238d18d2347dce91a2f25c345d45c4e6430b837d9da74e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsLimit/Varianta0c3a5595cef9b0c42238d18d2347dce91a2f25c345d45c4e6430b837d9da74e.lean#L59).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `53308164f8dce20b12c5fc860eefaef8a9f9c7c8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
