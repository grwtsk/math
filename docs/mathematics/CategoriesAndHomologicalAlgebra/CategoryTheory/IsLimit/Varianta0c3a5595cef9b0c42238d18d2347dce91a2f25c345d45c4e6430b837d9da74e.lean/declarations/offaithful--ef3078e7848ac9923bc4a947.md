## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:82031a867f7eee08941bbfae9af5aae966a0174b9c3a3f12f228b40a8b95fb25`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 869–882.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofFaithful {t : Cocone F} {D : Type u₄} [Category.{v₄} D] (G : C ⥤ D) [G.Faithful]
    (ht : IsColimit (mapCocone G t)) (desc : ∀ s : Cocone F, t.pt ⟶ s.pt)
    (h : ∀ s, G.map (desc s) = ht.desc (mapCocone G s)) : IsColimit t :=
  { desc
    fac := fun s j => by apply G.map_injective; rw [G.map_comp, h]; apply ht.fac
    uniq := fun s m w => by
      apply G.map_injective; rw [h]
      refine ht.uniq (mapCocone G s) _ fun j => ?_
      convert ← congrArg (fun f => G.map f) (w j)
      apply G.map_comp }

/-- If `F` and `G` are naturally isomorphic, then `F.mapCocone c` being a colimit implies
`G.mapCocone c` is also a colimit.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsLimit/Varianta0c3a5595cef9b0c42238d18d2347dce91a2f25c345d45c4e6430b837d9da74e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsLimit/Varianta0c3a5595cef9b0c42238d18d2347dce91a2f25c345d45c4e6430b837d9da74e.lean#L869).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `53308164f8dce20b12c5fc860eefaef8a9f9c7c8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
