## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:23d2250bcceb5b29f2d692fd842e5f280f97a6475706286b895bc4457383db91`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 569–586.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def BinaryBicone.isBilimitOfCokernelSnd {X Y : C} (b : BinaryBicone X Y)
    (hb : IsColimit b.inlCokernelCofork) : b.IsBilimit :=
  isBinaryBilimitOfIsColimit _ <|
    BinaryCofan.IsColimit.mk _ (fun f g => b.fst ≫ f + b.snd ≫ g) (fun f g => by simp)
      (fun f g => by simp) fun {T} f g m h₁ h₂ => by
      dsimp at m
      have h₁' : b.inl ≫ (m - (b.fst ≫ f + b.snd ≫ g)) = 0 := by simpa using sub_eq_zero.2 h₁
      have h₂' : b.inr ≫ (m - (b.fst ≫ f + b.snd ≫ g)) = 0 := by simpa using sub_eq_zero.2 h₂
      obtain ⟨q : Y ⟶ T, hq : b.snd ≫ q = m - (b.fst ≫ f + b.snd ≫ g)⟩ :=
        CokernelCofork.IsColimit.desc' hb _ h₁'
      rw [← sub_eq_zero, ← hq, ← Category.id_comp q, ← b.inr_snd, Category.assoc, hq, h₂',
        comp_zero]

/-- Every split epi `f` with a kernel induces a binary bicone with `f` as its `snd` and
the kernel map as its `inl`.
We will show in `binary_bicone_of_is_split_mono_of_cokernel` that this binary bicone is in fact
already a biproduct. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Biproducts/Variant9836381063faef4ce8da2d5b435c7151af57bad59efeff48186c8faff3fced3c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Biproducts/Variant9836381063faef4ce8da2d5b435c7151af57bad59efeff48186c8faff3fced3c.lean#L569).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `92645c7d2e57e1d95e923ee969f0b124a1ac66c7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
