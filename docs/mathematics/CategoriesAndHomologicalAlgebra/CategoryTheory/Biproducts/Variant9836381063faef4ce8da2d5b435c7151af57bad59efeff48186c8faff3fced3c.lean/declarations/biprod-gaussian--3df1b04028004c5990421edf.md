## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f3f0cf48c07ad22a6170a4064cfb8718a11179ae8ea548cf0c3ffd525548e515`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 741–751.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Biprod.gaussian' [IsIso f₁₁] :
    Σ' (L : X₁ ⊞ X₂ ≅ X₁ ⊞ X₂) (R : Y₁ ⊞ Y₂ ≅ Y₁ ⊞ Y₂) (g₂₂ : X₂ ⟶ Y₂),
      L.hom ≫ Biprod.ofComponents f₁₁ f₁₂ f₂₁ f₂₂ ≫ R.hom = biprod.map f₁₁ g₂₂ :=
  ⟨Biprod.unipotentLower (-f₂₁ ≫ inv f₁₁), Biprod.unipotentUpper (-inv f₁₁ ≫ f₁₂),
    f₂₂ - f₂₁ ≫ inv f₁₁ ≫ f₁₂, by ext <;> simp; abel⟩

/-- If `f` is a morphism `X₁ ⊞ X₂ ⟶ Y₁ ⊞ Y₂` whose `X₁ ⟶ Y₁` entry is an isomorphism,
then we can construct isomorphisms `L : X₁ ⊞ X₂ ≅ X₁ ⊞ X₂` and `R : Y₁ ⊞ Y₂ ≅ Y₁ ⊞ Y₂`
so that `L.hom ≫ g ≫ R.hom` is diagonal (with `X₁ ⟶ Y₁` component still `f`),
via Gaussian elimination.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Biproducts/Variant9836381063faef4ce8da2d5b435c7151af57bad59efeff48186c8faff3fced3c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Biproducts/Variant9836381063faef4ce8da2d5b435c7151af57bad59efeff48186c8faff3fced3c.lean#L741).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `92645c7d2e57e1d95e923ee969f0b124a1ac66c7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
