## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1091b78ba5faa7664072e58e2ead8d507d4d09184dff75ae39a67eb7a141a4c9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–149.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) preservesFiniteBiproductsOfPreservesBiproducts (F : C ⥤ D)
    [PreservesZeroMorphisms F] [PreservesBiproducts.{w₁} F] : PreservesFiniteBiproducts F where
  preserves {J} _ := by let := preservesBiproducts_shrink.{0} F; infer_instance

/-- A functor `F` preserves binary biproducts of `X` and `Y` if `F` maps every bilimit bicone over
`X` and `Y` to a bilimit bicone over `F.obj X` and `F.obj Y`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Biproducts/Variantb8dc8e1c1e91ca81c73e84f908bb7023910353e8ff0ce9c96f7a8338c5659c26.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Biproducts/Variantb8dc8e1c1e91ca81c73e84f908bb7023910353e8ff0ce9c96f7a8338c5659c26.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0590c7e2e0c984ae90b986b887d4392f13fea076` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
