## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:922a33327e81b1f095329a14cd4673f71c779545de8fa7b0a8c09534d7a3e54e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 208–230.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def preservesBinaryBiproductsOfPreservesBiproducts (F : C ⥤ D) [PreservesZeroMorphisms F]
    [PreservesBiproductsOfShape WalkingPair F] : PreservesBinaryBiproducts F where
  preserves {X} Y := preservesBinaryBiproductOfPreservesBiproduct F X Y
#align category_theory.limits.preserves_binary_biproducts_of_preserves_biproducts CategoryTheory.Limits.preservesBinaryBiproductsOfPreservesBiproducts

attribute [instance 100] PreservesBinaryBiproducts.preserves

end Limits

open CategoryTheory.Limits

namespace Functor

section Bicone

variable {J : Type w₁} (F : C ⥤ D) (f : J → C) [HasBiproduct f]

section

variable [HasBiproduct (F.obj ∘ f)]

/-- As for products, any functor between categories with biproducts gives rise to a morphism
    `F.obj (⨁ f) ⟶ ⨁ (F.obj ∘ f)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Biproducts/Variant9e88cde6e1c34f34710bd74d0ee334ba7e728d977ffb4e11c2d15d47edd64ef5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Biproducts/Variant9e88cde6e1c34f34710bd74d0ee334ba7e728d977ffb4e11c2d15d47edd64ef5.lean#L208).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8e859126652695252dbc9d2012e643af1f005219` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
