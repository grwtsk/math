## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:081ebd6c-4b1a-d609-4c31-26925de8ba70`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 792–819.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Biprod.column_nonzero_of_iso {W X Y Z : C} (f : W ⊞ X ⟶ Y ⊞ Z) [IsIso f] :
    𝟙 W = 0 ∨ biprod.inl ≫ f ≫ biprod.fst ≠ 0 ∨ biprod.inl ≫ f ≫ biprod.snd ≠ 0 := by
  by_contra! h
  rcases h with ⟨nz, a₁, a₂⟩
  set x := biprod.inl ≫ f ≫ inv f ≫ biprod.fst
  have h₁ : x = 𝟙 W := by simp [x]
  have h₀ : x = 0 := by
    dsimp [x]
    rw [← Category.id_comp (inv f), Category.assoc, ← biprod.total]
    conv_lhs =>
      slice 2 3
      rw [comp_add]
    simp only [Category.assoc]
    rw [comp_add_assoc, add_comp]
    conv_lhs =>
      congr
      next => skip
      slice 1 3
      rw [a₂]
    simp only [zero_comp, add_zero]
    conv_lhs =>
      slice 1 3
      rw [a₁]
    simp only [zero_comp]
  exact nz (h₁.symm.trans h₀)

end

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Biproducts/Variant1577afc4812a2b313d41907554988d6570e557216cc2bfd541a44d4c5c236b20.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Biproducts/Variant1577afc4812a2b313d41907554988d6570e557216cc2bfd541a44d4c5c236b20.lean#L792).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c6b3d98779a650aac31b033d2178498e51fa9481` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
