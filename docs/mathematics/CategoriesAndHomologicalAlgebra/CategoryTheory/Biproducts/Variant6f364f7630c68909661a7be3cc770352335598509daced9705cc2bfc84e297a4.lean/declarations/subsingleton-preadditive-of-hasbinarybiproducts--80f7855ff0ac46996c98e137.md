## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:809a8b65fc77b49342c1bcde6de287203eaee5706a1728ee491e193f908b6659`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 673–693.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance subsingleton_preadditive_of_hasBinaryBiproducts {C : Type u} [Category.{v} C]
    [HasZeroMorphisms C] [HasBinaryBiproducts C] : Subsingleton (Preadditive C) where
  allEq := fun a b => by
    apply Preadditive.ext; funext X Y; apply AddCommGroup.ext; funext f g
    have h₁ := @biprod.add_eq_lift_id_desc _ _ a _ _ f g
      (by convert! (inferInstance : HasBinaryBiproduct X X); subsingleton)
    have h₂ := @biprod.add_eq_lift_id_desc _ _ b _ _ f g
      (by convert! (inferInstance : HasBinaryBiproduct X X); subsingleton)
    refine h₁.trans (Eq.trans ?_ h₂.symm)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Biproducts/Variant6f364f7630c68909661a7be3cc770352335598509daced9705cc2bfc84e297a4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Biproducts/Variant6f364f7630c68909661a7be3cc770352335598509daced9705cc2bfc84e297a4.lean#L673).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8ef682df07d94bbafe66a33ce657e071f5563afa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
