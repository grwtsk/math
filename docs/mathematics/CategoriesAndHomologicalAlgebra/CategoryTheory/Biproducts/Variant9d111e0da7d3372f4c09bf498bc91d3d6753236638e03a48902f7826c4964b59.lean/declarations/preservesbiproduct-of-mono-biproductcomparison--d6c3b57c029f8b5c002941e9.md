## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:08eb22ca-9e63-4315-9ea0-6b508352b923`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 915–933.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma preservesBiproduct_of_mono_biproductComparison {f : J → C} [HasBiproduct f]
    [HasBiproduct (F.obj ∘ f)] [Mono (biproductComparison F f)] : PreservesBiproduct f F := by
  have : HasProduct fun b => F.obj (f b) := by
    change HasProduct (F.obj ∘ f)
    infer_instance
  have that : piComparison F f =
      (F.mapIso (biproduct.isoProduct f)).inv ≫
        biproductComparison F f ≫ (biproduct.isoProduct _).hom := by
    ext j
    convert! piComparison_comp_π F f j; simp [← Function.comp_def, ← Functor.map_comp]
  have : IsIso (biproductComparison F f) := isIso_of_mono_of_isSplitEpi _
  have : IsIso (piComparison F f) := by
    rw [that]
    infer_instance
  have := PreservesProduct.of_iso_comparison F f
  apply preservesBiproduct_of_preservesProduct

/-- If the (coproduct-like) biproduct comparison for `F` and `f` is an epimorphism, then `F`
preserves the biproduct of `F` and `f`. For the converse, see `mapBiproduct`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Biproducts/Variant9d111e0da7d3372f4c09bf498bc91d3d6753236638e03a48902f7826c4964b59.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Biproducts/Variant9d111e0da7d3372f4c09bf498bc91d3d6753236638e03a48902f7826c4964b59.lean#L915).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0476da510420c1d0d7e60046693a1b1761a98240` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
