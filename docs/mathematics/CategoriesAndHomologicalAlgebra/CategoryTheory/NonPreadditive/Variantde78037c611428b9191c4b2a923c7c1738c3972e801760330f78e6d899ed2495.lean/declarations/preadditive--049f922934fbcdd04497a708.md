## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f8b2fc467aa33378c723ac2d5fce7ce9f7c40dfaf73d0227797767cc7bcdc9e9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 406–424.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def preadditive : Preadditive C where
  homGroup X Y :=
    { add := (· + ·)
      add_assoc := add_assoc
      zero := 0
      zero_add := neg_neg
      add_zero := add_zero
      neg := fun f => -f
      neg_add_cancel := neg_add_cancel
      sub_eq_add_neg := fun f g => (add_neg f g).symm -- Porting note: autoParam failed
      add_comm := add_comm
      nsmul := nsmulRec
      zsmul := zsmulRec }
  add_comp := add_comp
  comp_add := comp_add

end

end CategoryTheory.NonPreadditiveAbelian
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NonPreadditive/Variantde78037c611428b9191c4b2a923c7c1738c3972e801760330f78e6d899ed2495.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NonPreadditive/Variantde78037c611428b9191c4b2a923c7c1738c3972e801760330f78e6d899ed2495.lean#L406).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bdfe1ddbc951a6a2399d756c4a32379b22e1b55d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
