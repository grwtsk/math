## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5dec7202989e62928814bb02a1f6bd6e1a574fd138ccd4d3309497898fa5011f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 154–186.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Mono (Abelian.factorThruCoimage f) :=
  let I := Abelian.coimage f
  let i := Abelian.factorThruCoimage f
  let p := cokernel.π (kernel.ι f)
  NormalEpiCategory.mono_of_cancel_zero _ fun R (g : R ⟶ I) (hgi : g ≫ i = 0) => by
    -- Since C is abelian, u := p ≫ coker g is the cokernel of some morphism h.
    let u := p ≫ cokernel.π g
    haveI : Epi u := epi_comp _ _
    haveI hu := normalEpiOfEpi u
    let h := hu.g
    -- By hypothesis, i factors through the cokernel of g via some t.
    obtain ⟨t, ht⟩ := cokernel.desc' g i hgi
    have hf : h ≫ f = 0
    calc
      h ≫ f = h ≫ p ≫ i := (Abelian.coimage.fac f).symm ▸ rfl
      _ = h ≫ p ≫ cokernel.π g ≫ t := (ht ▸ rfl)
      _ = h ≫ u ≫ t := by simp only [Category.assoc]
      _ = 0 ≫ t := by rw [← Category.assoc, hu.w]
      _ = 0 := zero_comp
    -- h factors through the kernel of f via some l.
    obtain ⟨l, hl⟩ := kernel.lift' f h hf
    have hhp : h ≫ p = 0
    calc
      h ≫ p = (l ≫ kernel.ι f) ≫ p := hl ▸ rfl
      _ = l ≫ 0 := by rw [Category.assoc, cokernel.condition]
      _ = 0 := comp_zero
    -- p factors through u = coker h via some s.
    obtain ⟨s, hs⟩ := NormalEpi.desc' u p hhp
    have hs' : p ≫ cokernel.π g ≫ s = p ≫ 𝟙 I := by rw [← Category.assoc, hs, Category.comp_id]
    haveI : Mono (cokernel.π g) := mono_of_mono_fac ((cancel_epi _).1 hs')
    -- coker g is a monomorphism, but g ≫ coker g = 0 = 0 ≫ coker g, so g = 0 as required.
    exact zero_of_comp_mono _ (cokernel.condition g)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NonPreadditive/Variantd0c26d92a63ecb944ac476e0cec0b6ca0ac9965cf4b9d9ba723fb182ca2253de.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NonPreadditive/Variantd0c26d92a63ecb944ac476e0cec0b6ca0ac9965cf4b9d9ba723fb182ca2253de.lean#L154).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ca060a74999a97976bf0b97eedb839c72f5f6827` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
