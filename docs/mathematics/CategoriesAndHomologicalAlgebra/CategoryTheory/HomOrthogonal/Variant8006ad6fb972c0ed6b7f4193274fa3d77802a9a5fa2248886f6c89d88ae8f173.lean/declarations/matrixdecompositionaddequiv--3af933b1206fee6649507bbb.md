## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:09e07d019b542931f78a2df4c1f8c06212a428e6431a9bd5664f06ec7065063c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 113–124.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def matrixDecompositionAddEquiv (o : HomOrthogonal s) {α β : Type} [Finite α]
    [Finite β] {f : α → ι} {g : β → ι} :
    ((⨁ fun a => s (f a)) ⟶ ⨁ fun b => s (g b)) ≃+
      ∀ i : ι, Matrix (g ⁻¹' {i}) (f ⁻¹' {i}) (End (s i)) :=

    map_add' := fun w z => by

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HomOrthogonal/Variant8006ad6fb972c0ed6b7f4193274fa3d77802a9a5fa2248886f6c89d88ae8f173.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HomOrthogonal/Variant8006ad6fb972c0ed6b7f4193274fa3d77802a9a5fa2248886f6c89d88ae8f173.lean#L113).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `119d7d5183d77d9b42d03e67605d3ccdfee8afd7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
