## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3426d85ce3308545cdac9db7c4d08826958a06e4efbb4fa1b73ddecbdddd5966`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 176–199.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def matrixDecompositionLinearEquiv (o : HomOrthogonal s) {α β : Type} [Finite α]
    [Finite β] {f : α → ι} {g : β → ι} :
    ((⨁ fun a => s (f a)) ⟶ ⨁ fun b => s (g b)) ≃ₗ[R]
      ∀ i : ι, Matrix (g ⁻¹' {i}) (f ⁻¹' {i}) (End (s i)) :=
  { o.matrixDecompositionAddEquiv with
    map_smul' := fun w z => by
      ext
      dsimp [biproduct.components]
      simp }

end

/-!
The hypothesis that `End (s i)` has invariant basis number is automatically satisfied
if `s i` is simple (as then `End (s i)` is a division ring).
-/


variable [∀ i, InvariantBasisNumber (End (s i))]

/-- Given a hom orthogonal family `s : ι → C`
for which each `End (s i)` is a ring with invariant basis number (e.g. if each `s i` is simple),
if two direct sums over `s` are isomorphic, then they have the same multiplicities.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HomOrthogonal/Variant753d39b708b8c8ee3f591d8392e878caebf4d0d4ceccb1926eaad9032dac92fe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HomOrthogonal/Variant753d39b708b8c8ee3f591d8392e878caebf4d0d4ceccb1926eaad9032dac92fe.lean#L176).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `30faabc0ef1f0e0c4d98745dadbdcee8825b5fb2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
