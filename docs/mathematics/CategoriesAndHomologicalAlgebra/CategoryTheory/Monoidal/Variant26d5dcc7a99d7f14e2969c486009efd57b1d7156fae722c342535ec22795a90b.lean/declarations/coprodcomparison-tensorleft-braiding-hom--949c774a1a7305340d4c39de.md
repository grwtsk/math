## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2e563647-1888-2118-51d2-b2374872ddfa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 215–222.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma coprodComparison_tensorLeft_braiding_hom [BraidedCategory C] {X Y Z : C} :
    (coprodComparison (tensorLeft X) Y Z) ≫ (β_ X (Y ⨿ Z)).hom =
    (coprod.map (β_ X Y).hom (β_ X Z).hom) ≫ (coprodComparison (tensorRight X) Y Z) := by
  simp [coprodComparison]

/-- In a symmetric monoidal category, the right distributivity is equal to
the left distributivity up to braiding isomorphisms. -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Monoidal/Variant26d5dcc7a99d7f14e2969c486009efd57b1d7156fae722c342535ec22795a90b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Monoidal/Variant26d5dcc7a99d7f14e2969c486009efd57b1d7156fae722c342535ec22795a90b.lean#L215).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3115b9e44c8bd813b608d83ac29c61bfcc4989b2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
