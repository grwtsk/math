## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7c6d70a9676bc6a16693fd147c1e68e4431faece833db2d88ebb73d6a1f86567`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 48–60.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def bifunctorComp₁₂ (F₁₂ : C₁ ⥤ C₂ ⥤ C₁₂) (G : C₁₂ ⥤ C₃ ⥤ C₄) :
    C₁ ⥤ C₂ ⥤ C₃ ⥤ C₄ where
  obj X₁ := bifunctorComp₁₂Obj F₁₂ G X₁
  map {X₁ Y₁} φ :=
    { app := fun X₂ =>
        { app := fun X₃ => (G.map ((F₁₂.map φ).app X₂)).app X₃ }
      naturality := fun {X₂ Y₂} ψ => by
        ext X₃
        dsimp
        simp only [← NatTrans.comp_app, ← G.map_comp, NatTrans.naturality] }

/-- Auxiliary definition for `bifunctorComp₁₂Functor`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Trifunctor/Variantc7e48be36c91e134d698a730b34e95e8986e6bba09bb203440a7ddca1e33a3fc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Trifunctor/Variantc7e48be36c91e134d698a730b34e95e8986e6bba09bb203440a7ddca1e33a3fc.lean#L48).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9c254c82725e045c7a53f5eb923eac1a85dc5b67` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
