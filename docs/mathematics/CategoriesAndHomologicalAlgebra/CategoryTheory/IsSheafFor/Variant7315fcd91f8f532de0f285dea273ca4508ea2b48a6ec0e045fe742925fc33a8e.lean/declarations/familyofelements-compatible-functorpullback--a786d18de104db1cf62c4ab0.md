## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e82be21a-e3e4-a1fc-bd4e-6d55a1635448`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 332–342.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem FamilyOfElements.Compatible.functorPullback (h : x.Compatible) :
    (x.functorPullback F).Compatible := by
  intro Z₁ Z₂ W g₁ g₂ f₁ f₂ h₁ h₂ eq
  exact h (F.map g₁) (F.map g₂) h₁ h₂ (by simp only [← F.map_comp, eq])

end FunctorPullback

/-- Given a family of elements of a sieve `S` on `X` whose values factors through `F`, we can
realize it as a family of elements of `S.functorPushforward F`. Since the preimage is obtained by
choice, this is not well-defined generally.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsSheafFor/Variant7315fcd91f8f532de0f285dea273ca4508ea2b48a6ec0e045fe742925fc33a8e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/IsSheafFor/Variant7315fcd91f8f532de0f285dea273ca4508ea2b48a6ec0e045fe742925fc33a8e.lean#L332).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8485a07ed9e2e94ce5dc8de624236eeef4406f9e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
