## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7be9a37a9a65f5cce5e9980438545cf29b5bcae22254d85570064c2db0cbb7bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 91–100.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def comparisonLeftAdjointObj (A : (adj).toMonad.Algebra)
    [HasCoequalizer ((F).map A.a) ((adj).counit.app _)] : D :=
  coequalizer ((F).map A.a) ((adj).counit.app _)
#align category_theory.monad.monadicity_internal.comparison_left_adjoint_obj CategoryTheory.Monad.MonadicityInternal.comparisonLeftAdjointObj

/--
We have a bijection of homsets which will be used to construct the left adjoint to the comparison
functor.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Monadicity/Variant4bd1a8c4458ee8dbd1f0bcd9c1675acf770f596c2e5f023f8452b40ccdc0f458.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Monadicity/Variant4bd1a8c4458ee8dbd1f0bcd9c1675acf770f596c2e5f023f8452b40ccdc0f458.lean#L91).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d10ae4a40e74ca919a38e531eb54149c0556d11d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
