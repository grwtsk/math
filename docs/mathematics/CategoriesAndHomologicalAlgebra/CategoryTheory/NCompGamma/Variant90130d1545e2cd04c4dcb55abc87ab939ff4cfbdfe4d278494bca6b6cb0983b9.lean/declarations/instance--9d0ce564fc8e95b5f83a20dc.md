## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:28b72a0aea9aa1de31993459be5a6da332f8ff577514797710d1bafeb8504146`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 235–246.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : IsIso (Γ₂N₂.natTrans : (N₂ : Karoubi (SimplicialObject C) ⥤ _) ⋙ _ ⟶ _) := by
  have : ∀ P : Karoubi (SimplicialObject C), IsIso (Γ₂N₂.natTrans.app P) := by
    intro P
    have : IsIso (N₂.map (Γ₂N₂.natTrans.app P)) := by
      have h := identity_N₂_objectwise P
      dsimp only [Functor.id_obj, Functor.comp_obj] at h
      rw [hom_comp_eq_id] at h
      rw [h]
      infer_instance
    exact isIso_of_reflects_iso _ N₂
  apply NatIso.isIso_of_isIso_app

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NCompGamma/Variant90130d1545e2cd04c4dcb55abc87ab939ff4cfbdfe4d278494bca6b6cb0983b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/NCompGamma/Variant90130d1545e2cd04c4dcb55abc87ab939ff4cfbdfe4d278494bca6b6cb0983b9.lean#L235).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f82166a9505601dd88a18d5960b1f9c9086341d1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
