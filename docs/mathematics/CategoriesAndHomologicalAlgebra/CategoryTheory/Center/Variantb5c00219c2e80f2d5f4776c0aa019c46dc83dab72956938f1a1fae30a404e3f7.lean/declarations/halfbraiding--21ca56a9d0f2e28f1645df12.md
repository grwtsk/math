## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5d71a24444b7d42d458d797ffed1ae9287998c6ea045b4aeae6e8a5239113456`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 54–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure HalfBraiding (X : C) where
  /-- The family of isomorphisms `X ⊗ U ≅ U ⊗ X` -/
  β : ∀ U, X ⊗ U ≅ U ⊗ X
  monoidal : ∀ U U', (β (U ⊗ U')).hom =
      (α_ _ _ _).inv ≫
        ((β U).hom ▷ U') ≫ (α_ _ _ _).hom ≫ (U ◁ (β U').hom) ≫ (α_ _ _ _).inv := by
    cat_disch
  naturality : ∀ {U U'} (f : U ⟶ U'), (X ◁ f) ≫ (β U').hom = (β U).hom ≫ (f ▷ X) := by
    cat_disch

attribute [reassoc, simp] HalfBraiding.monoidal -- the reassoc lemma is redundant as a simp lemma

attribute [simp, reassoc] HalfBraiding.naturality

variable (C)

/-- The Drinfeld center of a monoidal category `C` has as objects pairs `⟨X, b⟩`, where `X : C`
and `b` is a half-braiding on `X`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Center/Variantb5c00219c2e80f2d5f4776c0aa019c46dc83dab72956938f1a1fae30a404e3f7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Center/Variantb5c00219c2e80f2d5f4776c0aa019c46dc83dab72956938f1a1fae30a404e3f7.lean#L54).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `246e075463981e6bc758dfe560c57e0084d2b9f4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
