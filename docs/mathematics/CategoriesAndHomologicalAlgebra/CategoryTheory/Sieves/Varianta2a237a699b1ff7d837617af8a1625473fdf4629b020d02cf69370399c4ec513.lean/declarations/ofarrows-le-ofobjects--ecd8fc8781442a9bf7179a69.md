## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e1033488-37d0-179d-047c-f448067527e4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 512–519.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma ofArrows_le_ofObjects
    {I : Type*} (Y : I → C) {X : C} (f : ∀ i, Y i ⟶ X) :
    Sieve.ofArrows Y f ≤ Sieve.ofObjects Y X := by
  intro W g hg
  rw [mem_ofArrows_iff] at hg
  obtain ⟨i, a, rfl⟩ := hg
  exact ⟨i, ⟨a⟩⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Sieves/Varianta2a237a699b1ff7d837617af8a1625473fdf4629b020d02cf69370399c4ec513.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Sieves/Varianta2a237a699b1ff7d837617af8a1625473fdf4629b020d02cf69370399c4ec513.lean#L512).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c608b66f79d2476f71be004df68104da609bc11a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
