## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:83828ecde062c68555803bce9d22f88c5bfd425b166e9fd9d16ee2fb4841b769`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 565–574.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def tensorUnitRight : C ⥤ C where
  obj X := X ⊗ 𝟙_ C
  map {X Y : C} (f : X ⟶ Y) := f ⊗ 𝟙 (𝟙_ C)
#align category_theory.monoidal_category.tensor_unit_right CategoryTheory.MonoidalCategory.tensorUnitRight

-- We can express the associator and the unitors, given componentwise above,
-- as natural isomorphisms.
-- Porting Note: Had to add a `simps!` because Lean was complaining this wasn't a constructor app.
/-- The associator as a natural isomorphism. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Category/Variant26402d2f31289107df66cd53bff61282cc1b5098fff58ca7af409728212861f5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Category/Variant26402d2f31289107df66cd53bff61282cc1b5098fff58ca7af409728212861f5.lean#L565).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4c5afe2bfa139540d778ba42a1b2e9c29c8f92e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
