## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7e5743ab1d1423ae8e91112b574de78c59d324ba4325dac827b9dff20b0e682b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 82–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def opensLeCoverCocone : Cocone (ObjectProperty.ι _ : OpensLeCover U ⥤ Opens X) where
  pt := iSup U
  ι := { app := fun V : OpensLeCover U => V.homToIndex ≫ Opens.leSupr U _ }

end SheafCondition

open SheafCondition

/-- An equivalent formulation of the sheaf condition
(which we prove equivalent to the usual one below as
`isSheaf_iff_isSheafOpensLeCover`).

A presheaf is a sheaf if `F` sends the cone `(opensLeCoverCocone U).op` to a limit cone.
(Recall `opensLeCoverCocone U`, has cone point `iSup U`,
mapping down to any `V` which is contained in some `U i`.)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/OpensLeCover/Variant468d0b05076256ee7ea3b2f91ceab894c08171ee2646f3dfc3eaa0a30d58876d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/OpensLeCover/Variant468d0b05076256ee7ea3b2f91ceab894c08171ee2646f3dfc3eaa0a30d58876d.lean#L82).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `459205ec8eae56c93f84743db0f6fa6bb4ede1af` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
