## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8fce8838-bb37-8e78-5d3d-29276e5afd81`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 191–207.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean

      (generatingMonomorphisms G).pushouts
        (Subobject.ofLE _ _ (le_largerSubobject hG A)) := by
  by_cases hA : A = ⊤
  · subst hA
    have := (Subobject.isIso_arrow_iff_eq_top (largerSubobject hG (⊤ : Subobject X))).2 (by simp)
    exact (MorphismProperty.arrow_mk_iso_iff _
      (Arrow.isoMk (asIso (Subobject.arrow _)) (asIso (Subobject.arrow _)) (by simp))).2
        (isomorphisms_le_pushouts_generatingMonomorphisms G (𝟙 X)
          (MorphismProperty.isomorphisms.infer_property _))
  · refine (MorphismProperty.arrow_mk_iso_iff _ ?_).1

    exact Arrow.isoMk (Iso.refl _)
      (Subobject.isoOfEq _ _ ((by simp [largerSubobject, dite_eq_right hA])))

variable [IsGrothendieckAbelian.{w} C]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/EnoughInjectives/Variantbcdf1ec0dbf7321b56a3dbd4eb575f0d35dc1b7e909a6124eb686e641c38828a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/EnoughInjectives/Variantbcdf1ec0dbf7321b56a3dbd4eb575f0d35dc1b7e909a6124eb686e641c38828a.lean#L191).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e3bdc9953f13dbbffdd6cc937da96991022bbb99` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
