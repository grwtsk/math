## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:603e5fa623f3839e9e82692716c549dfc399bf0c183736ae493ca5bf80de7d54`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance hasLimitsOfShape_of_isConnected {B : C} [IsConnected J] [HasLimitsOfShape J C] :
    HasLimitsOfShape J (Over B) where
  has_limit F := hasLimit_of_created F (forget B)

set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency.types false in
set_option backward.defeqAttrib.useBackward true in
/-- The functor taking a cone over `F` to a cone over `Over.post F : Over i ⥤ Over (F.obj i)`.
This takes limit cones to limit cones when `J` is cofiltered. See `isLimitConePost` -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Connected/Variantbc97120b9041587b3f55c991ae6551721d67d01db3b78234a77b2f0d24991c15.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Connected/Variantbc97120b9041587b3f55c991ae6551721d67d01db3b78234a77b2f0d24991c15.lean#L164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5c7a8276f2193a95f777db0f74e196882db2106c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
