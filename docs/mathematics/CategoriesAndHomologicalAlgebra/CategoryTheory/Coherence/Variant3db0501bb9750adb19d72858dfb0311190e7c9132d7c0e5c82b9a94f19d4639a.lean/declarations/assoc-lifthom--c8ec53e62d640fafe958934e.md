## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ed7a95a6-692c-b094-89f5-73056b61565a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 276–287.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma assoc_liftHom {W X Y Z : C} [LiftObj W] [LiftObj X] [LiftObj Y]
    (f : W ⟶ X) (g : X ⟶ Y) (h : Y ⟶ Z) [LiftHom f] [LiftHom g] :
    f ≫ (g ≫ h) = (f ≫ g) ≫ h :=
  (Category.assoc _ _ _).symm

/--
Internal tactic used in `coherence`.

Rewrites an equation `f = g` as `f₀ ≫ f₁ = g₀ ≫ g₁`,
where `f₀` and `g₀` are maximal prefixes of `f` and `g` (possibly after reassociating)
which are "liftable" (i.e. expressible as compositions of unitors and associators).

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Coherence/Variant3db0501bb9750adb19d72858dfb0311190e7c9132d7c0e5c82b9a94f19d4639a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Coherence/Variant3db0501bb9750adb19d72858dfb0311190e7c9132d7c0e5c82b9a94f19d4639a.lean#L276).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d226a30a2cad4f486c7cbf440647b572cf2e805e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
