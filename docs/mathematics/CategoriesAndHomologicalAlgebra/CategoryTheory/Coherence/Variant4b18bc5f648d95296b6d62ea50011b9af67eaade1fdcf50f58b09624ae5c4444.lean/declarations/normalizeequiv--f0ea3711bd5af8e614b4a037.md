## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:67898fc0ed420e38308949fef9754e3732043f664eefeb6a89244d1c8548e4ce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 204–216.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def normalizeEquiv (a b : B) : Hom a b ≌ Discrete (Path.{v + 1} a b) :=
  Equivalence.mk ((normalize _).mapFunctor a b) (inclusionPath a b) (normalizeUnitIso a b)
    (Discrete.natIso fun f => eqToIso (by
      obtain ⟨f⟩ := f
      induction f with
      | nil => rfl
      | cons _ _ ih =>
        ext1 -- Porting note: `tidy` closes the goal in mathlib3 but `aesop` doesn't here.
        injection ih with ih
        conv_rhs => rw [← ih]
        rfl))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Coherence/Variant4b18bc5f648d95296b6d62ea50011b9af67eaade1fdcf50f58b09624ae5c4444.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Coherence/Variant4b18bc5f648d95296b6d62ea50011b9af67eaade1fdcf50f58b09624ae5c4444.lean#L204).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b36b9bc493f888a2e4375cc2f6f42e6620fe7f02` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
