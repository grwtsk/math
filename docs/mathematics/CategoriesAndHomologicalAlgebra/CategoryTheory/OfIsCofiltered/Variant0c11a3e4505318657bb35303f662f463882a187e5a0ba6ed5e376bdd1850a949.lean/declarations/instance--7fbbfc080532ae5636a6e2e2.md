## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:91f13f71bb02862d39e48129b3f442d6adb1c1697c7adbe232e49d751607a18a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 106–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [IsCofiltered N] : (functor.{w} p).Initial := by
  refine Functor.initial_of_exists_of_isCofiltered _ (fun e ↦ ?_) ?_
  · induction e with | mk x
    obtain ⟨U, f, rfl⟩ := fiberMk_jointly_surjective x
    exact ⟨U, f, by simp⟩
  · intro e V φ₁ φ₂
    induction e with | mk x
    obtain ⟨U, f, rfl⟩ := fiberMk_jointly_surjective x
    obtain ⟨W, g, hg⟩ := exists_of_fiberMk_eq_fiberMk
      (show fiberMk.{w} φ₁.hom = fiberMk.{w} φ₂.hom by
        simpa using φ₁.map_val.trans φ₂.map_val.symm)
    exact ⟨_, g, by cat_disch⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/OfIsCofiltered/Variant0c11a3e4505318657bb35303f662f463882a187e5a0ba6ed5e376bdd1850a949.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/OfIsCofiltered/Variant0c11a3e4505318657bb35303f662f463882a187e5a0ba6ed5e376bdd1850a949.lean#L106).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `07877324223c0b9e07c5966e5e568eeee42e630e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
