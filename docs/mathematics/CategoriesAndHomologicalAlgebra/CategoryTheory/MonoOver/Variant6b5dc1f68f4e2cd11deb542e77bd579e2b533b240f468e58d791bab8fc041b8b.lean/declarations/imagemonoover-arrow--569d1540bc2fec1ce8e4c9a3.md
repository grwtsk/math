## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:392e6a0a-ea29-07f5-c650-619d735f5dfb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 356–368.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem imageMonoOver_arrow (f : X ⟶ Y) [HasImage f] : (imageMonoOver f).arrow = image.ι f :=
  rfl
#align category_theory.mono_over.image_mono_over_arrow CategoryTheory.MonoOver.imageMonoOver_arrow

end Image

section Image

variable [HasImages C]

/-- Taking the image of a morphism gives a functor `Over X ⥤ MonoOver X`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/MonoOver/Variant6b5dc1f68f4e2cd11deb542e77bd579e2b533b240f468e58d791bab8fc041b8b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/MonoOver/Variant6b5dc1f68f4e2cd11deb542e77bd579e2b533b240f468e58d791bab8fc041b8b.lean#L356).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6547b1c40438df0cb43f30ea013b914ad60d6544` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
