Provisional mathematical ideas and direction: grwtsk contributors.
Provisional composite search, probabilistic symbolic recombination and linearized diffusive computation: OpenAI/Codex.
Cache warming and model sculpting: the countless, often unnamed mathematicians, enthusiasts, and curious minds whose work and questions have helped shape these tools, and who now have new ways to pursue mathematical answers to the endlessly deep question: “Why?”
These are owner-supplied provisional roles; exact contributions and source lineage need clarification.

/-
A minimal category/functor layer implemented with Lean core only.

The project intentionally avoids a Mathlib dependency.  These structures are
sufficient to type the realization categories and to state comparison
equivalences as full, faithful, and essentially surjective functors.
