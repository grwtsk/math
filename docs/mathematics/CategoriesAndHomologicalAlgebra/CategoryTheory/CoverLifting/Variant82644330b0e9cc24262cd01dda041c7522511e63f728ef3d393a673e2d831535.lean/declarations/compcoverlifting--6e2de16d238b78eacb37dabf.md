## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8f3c5e9f-e99a-8b3f-fd7a-6114a11a8ff9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem compCoverLifting {F : C ⥤ D} (hu : CoverLifting J K F) {G : D ⥤ E}
    (hv : CoverLifting K L G) : CoverLifting J L (F ⋙ G) :=
  ⟨fun h => hu.cover_lift (hv.cover_lift h)⟩
#align category_theory.comp_cover_lifting CategoryTheory.compCoverLifting

end CoverLifting

/-!
We will now prove that `Ran G.op` (`ₚu`) maps sheaves to sheaves if `G` is cover-lifting. This can
be found in <https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00XK>. However, the proof given here uses the
amalgamation definition of sheaves, and thus does not require that `C` or `D` has categorical
pullbacks.

For the following proof sketch, `⊆` denotes the homs on `C` and `D` as in the topological analogy.
By definition, the presheaf `𝒢 : Dᵒᵖ ⥤ A` is a sheaf if for every sieve `S` of `U : D`, and every
compatible family of morphisms `X ⟶ 𝒢(V)` for each `V ⊆ U : S` with a fixed source `X`,
we can glue them into a morphism `X ⟶ 𝒢(U)`.

Since the presheaf `𝒢 := (Ran G.op).obj ℱ.val` is defined via `𝒢(U) = lim_{G(V) ⊆ U} ℱ(V)`, for
gluing the family `x` into a `X ⟶ 𝒢(U)`, it suffices to provide a `X ⟶ ℱ(Y)` for each
`G(Y) ⊆ U`. This can be done since `{ Y' ⊆ Y : G(Y') ⊆ U ∈ S}` is a covering sieve for `Y` on
`C` (by the cover-lifting property of `G`). Thus the morphisms `X ⟶ 𝒢(G(Y')) ⟶ ℱ(Y')` can be
glued into a morphism `X ⟶ ℱ(Y)`. This is done in `get_sections`.

In `glued_limit_cone`, we verify these obtained sections are indeed compatible, and thus we obtain
A `X ⟶ 𝒢(U)`. The remaining work is to verify that this is indeed the amalgamation and is unique.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CoverLifting/Variant82644330b0e9cc24262cd01dda041c7522511e63f728ef3d393a673e2d831535.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CoverLifting/Variant82644330b0e9cc24262cd01dda041c7522511e63f728ef3d393a673e2d831535.lean#L87).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
