## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:362adb2d1ffe63b3bb65d31b2bd673e0f3b81d3926f16439c65a09c05ff36f20`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 364–378.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def pullbackSheafificationCompatibility
    {G : C ⥤ D} (Hp : CoverPreserving J K G)
    (Hl : CoverLifting J K G) (Hc : CompatiblePreserving K G) :
    (whiskeringLeft _ _ A).obj G.op ⋙ presheafToSheaf J A ≅
    presheafToSheaf K A ⋙ pullback A Hc Hp :=
  letI A1 : (whiskeringLeft _ _ A).obj G.op ⊣ _ := Ran.adjunction _ _
  letI A2 : presheafToSheaf J A ⊣ _ := sheafificationAdjunction _ _
  letI B1 : presheafToSheaf K A ⊣ _ := sheafificationAdjunction _ _
  letI B2 : pullback A Hc Hp ⊣ _ := pullbackCopullbackAdjunction _ _ Hl _
  letI A12 := A1.comp A2
  letI B12 := B1.comp B2
  A12.leftAdjointUniq B12

/- Implementation: This is primarily used to prove the lemma
`pullbackSheafificationCompatibility_hom_app_val`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CoverLifting/Variant82644330b0e9cc24262cd01dda041c7522511e63f728ef3d393a673e2d831535.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CoverLifting/Variant82644330b0e9cc24262cd01dda041c7522511e63f728ef3d393a673e2d831535.lean#L364).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c2a1bcc0622e29c7d2f80c77563d756e8d41d1dd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
