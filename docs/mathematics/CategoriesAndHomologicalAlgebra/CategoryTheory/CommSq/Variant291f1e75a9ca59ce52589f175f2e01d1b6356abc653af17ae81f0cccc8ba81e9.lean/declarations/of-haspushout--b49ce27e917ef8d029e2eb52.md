## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:be9dbf76-d252-b4d1-8cee-8ba736b2af30`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 368–375.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem of_hasPushout (f : Z ⟶ X) (g : Z ⟶ Y) [HasPushout f g] :
    IsPushout f g (pushout.inl : X ⟶ pushout f g) (pushout.inr : Y ⟶ pushout f g) :=
  of_isColimit (colimit.isColimit (span f g))
#align category_theory.is_pushout.of_has_pushout CategoryTheory.IsPushout.of_hasPushout

/-- If `c` is a colimiting binary coproduct cocone, and we have an initial object,
then we have `IsPushout 0 0 c.inl c.inr`
(where each `0` is the unique morphism from the initial object). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CommSq/Variant291f1e75a9ca59ce52589f175f2e01d1b6356abc653af17ae81f0cccc8ba81e9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CommSq/Variant291f1e75a9ca59ce52589f175f2e01d1b6356abc653af17ae81f0cccc8ba81e9.lean#L368).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c095f5d742d6fd51df32656687f120cfba7dcdfa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
