## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cc1f732cf9d7fd27236d275853c25f68ccdee1680d2480b624ae3250b8f2bd0c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 552–557.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def Arrow.middle {X : C} {S : J.Cover X} {T : ∀ I : S.Arrow, J.Cover I.Y}
    (I : (S.bind T).Arrow) : C :=
  I.hf.choose

/-- An arrow in bind has the form `A ⟶ B ⟶ X` where `A ⟶ B` is an arrow in `T I` for some `I`.
and `B ⟶ X` is an arrow of `S`. This is the hom `A ⟶ B`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Grothendieck/Variant74899b7c45514a03656f25b97a8352530f9c54e1c3db53893aad7926053dc32e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Grothendieck/Variant74899b7c45514a03656f25b97a8352530f9c54e1c3db53893aad7926053dc32e.lean#L552).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b001069f2fce3f3efc933d7a0e48cc12fbe91e7f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
