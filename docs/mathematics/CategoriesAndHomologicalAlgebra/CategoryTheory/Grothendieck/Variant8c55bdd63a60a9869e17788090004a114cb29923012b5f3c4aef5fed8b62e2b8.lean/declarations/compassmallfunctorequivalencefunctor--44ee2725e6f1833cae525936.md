## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:12c32023cf4c914f20cf51be521ba01453a003b38570413a7737ceea4d97b49c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 333–344.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def compAsSmallFunctorEquivalenceFunctor :
    Grothendieck (F ⋙ Cat.asSmallFunctor.{w}) ⥤ Grothendieck F where
  obj X := ⟨X.base, AsSmall.down.obj X.fiber⟩
  map f := ⟨f.base, AsSmall.down.map f.fiber⟩
  map_id _ := by apply Grothendieck.ext <;> simp
  map_comp _ _ := by apply Grothendieck.ext <;> simp [down_comp]

/-- Taking the Grothendieck construction on `F ⋙ asSmallFunctor`, where
`asSmallFunctor : Cat ⥤ Cat` is the functor which turns each category into a small category of a
(potentially) larger universe, is equivalent to the Grothendieck construction on `F` itself. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Grothendieck/Variant8c55bdd63a60a9869e17788090004a114cb29923012b5f3c4aef5fed8b62e2b8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Grothendieck/Variant8c55bdd63a60a9869e17788090004a114cb29923012b5f3c4aef5fed8b62e2b8.lean#L333).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `148e5a3d4bdb9c92c888240a5741295c9acf8628` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
