## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e6f4a90f-fc6d-881e-721d-068091ff957f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 132–166.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem compatiblePreservingOfFlat {C : Type u₁} [Category.{v₁} C] {D : Type u₁} [Category.{v₁} D]
    (K : GrothendieckTopology D) (G : C ⥤ D) [RepresentablyFlat G] : CompatiblePreserving K G := by
  constructor
  intro ℱ Z T x hx Y₁ Y₂ X f₁ f₂ g₁ g₂ hg₁ hg₂ e
  -- First, `f₁` and `f₂` form a cone over `cospan g₁ g₂ ⋙ u`.
  let c : Cone (cospan g₁ g₂ ⋙ G) :=
    (Cones.postcompose (diagramIsoCospan (cospan g₁ g₂ ⋙ G)).inv).obj (PullbackCone.mk f₁ f₂ e)
  /-
    This can then be viewed as a cospan of structured arrows, and we may obtain an arbitrary cone
    over it since `StructuredArrow W u` is cofiltered.
    Then, it suffices to prove that it is compatible when restricted onto `u(c'.X.right)`.
    -/
  let c' := IsCofiltered.cone (c.toStructuredArrow ⋙ StructuredArrow.pre _ _ _)
  have eq₁ : f₁ = (c'.pt.hom ≫ G.map (c'.π.app left).right) ≫ eqToHom (by simp) := by

  -- despite goal being of the form f a = f b, with f=`ℱ.val.map (Quiver.Hom.op c'.pt.hom)`
  /-
    Since everything now falls in the image of `u`,
    the result follows from the compatibility of `x` in the image of `u`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CoverPreserving/Variant827a699b28332f42882b80557f7411f32472757fba652cf6524d72deefee2390.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/CoverPreserving/Variant827a699b28332f42882b80557f7411f32472757fba652cf6524d72deefee2390.lean#L132).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
