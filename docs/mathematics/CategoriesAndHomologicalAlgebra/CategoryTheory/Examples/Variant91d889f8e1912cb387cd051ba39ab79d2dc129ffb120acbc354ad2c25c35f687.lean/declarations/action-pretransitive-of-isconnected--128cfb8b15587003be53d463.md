## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0c6ff88f-3d6a-db40-52c0-8b925f66c5dd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 117–140.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Action.pretransitive_of_isConnected (X : Action FintypeCat G)
    [PreGaloisCategory.IsConnected X] : MulAction.IsPretransitive G X.V where
  exists_smul_eq x y := by
    /- We show that the `G`-orbit of `x` is a non-initial subobject of `X` and hence by
    connectedness, the orbit equals `X.V`. -/
    let T : Set X.V := MulAction.orbit G x
    have : Fintype T := Fintype.ofFinite T
    let : MulAction G (FintypeCat.of T) := inferInstanceAs <| MulAction G
      ↑(MulAction.orbit G x)
    let T' : Action FintypeCat G := Action.FintypeCat.ofMulAction G ↧T
    let i : T' ⟶ X := ⟨FintypeCat.homMk Subtype.val, fun _ ↦ rfl⟩
    have : Mono i := ConcreteCategory.mono_of_injective _ (Subtype.val_injective)
    have : IsIso i := by
      apply IsConnected.noTrivialComponent T' i

/-- A nonempty `G`-set with transitive `G`-action is connected. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Examples/Variant91d889f8e1912cb387cd051ba39ab79d2dc129ffb120acbc354ad2c25c35f687.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Examples/Variant91d889f8e1912cb387cd051ba39ab79d2dc129ffb120acbc354ad2c25c35f687.lean#L117).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `57bd30bece99a90129f5524981432082d840e995` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
