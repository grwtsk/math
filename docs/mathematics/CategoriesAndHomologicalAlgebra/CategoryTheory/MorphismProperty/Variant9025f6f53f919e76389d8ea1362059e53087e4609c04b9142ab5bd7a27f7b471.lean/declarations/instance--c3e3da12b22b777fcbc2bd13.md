## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1075668c5c24673a8b14a29b725612975d1de63915100ac62205fca6c6cbf989`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 275–284.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [P.ContainsIdentities] (Y : P.Over ⊤ X) :
    Unique (Y ⟶ Over.mk ⊤ (𝟙 X) (P.id_mem X)) where
  default := Over.homMk Y.hom
  uniq a := by
    ext
    · simp only [mk_left, homMk_hom, Over.homMk_left]
      rw [← Over.w a]
      simp only [mk_left, Functor.const_obj_obj, mk_hom, Category.comp_id]

/-- `X ⟶ X` is the terminal object of `P.Over ⊤ X`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/MorphismProperty/Variant9025f6f53f919e76389d8ea1362059e53087e4609c04b9142ab5bd7a27f7b471.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/MorphismProperty/Variant9025f6f53f919e76389d8ea1362059e53087e4609c04b9142ab5bd7a27f7b471.lean#L275).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77887bf594e7b084cdea7a9c2ef439f99b7e4463` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
