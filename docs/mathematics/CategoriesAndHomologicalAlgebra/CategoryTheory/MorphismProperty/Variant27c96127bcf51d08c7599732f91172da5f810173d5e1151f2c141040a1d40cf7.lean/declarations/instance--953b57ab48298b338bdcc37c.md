## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:50a9ab2a9d90174d8a5122cde6944964d8d0ee0933ee05b36f1610ee202a347b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 352–360.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance [HasPushouts T]
    [P.IsStableUnderComposition] [P.IsStableUnderCobaseChange] [P.HasOfPrecompProperty P] :
    CreatesColimitsOfShape WalkingSpan (Under.forget P ⊤ X) := by
  apply +allowSynthFailures forgetCreatesColimitsOfShapeOfClosed
  · exact inferInstanceAs (HasColimitsOfShape WalkingSpan (Under X))
  · apply Under.closedUnderColimitsOfShape_pushout

/-- If `P` is stable under composition, cobase change and satisfies pre-cancellation,
`P.Under ⊤ X` has pushouts. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/MorphismProperty/Variant27c96127bcf51d08c7599732f91172da5f810173d5e1151f2c141040a1d40cf7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/MorphismProperty/Variant27c96127bcf51d08c7599732f91172da5f810173d5e1151f2c141040a1d40cf7.lean#L352).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `498ed5b92421af34cb5b56eb5ead9ff04d51ebdc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
