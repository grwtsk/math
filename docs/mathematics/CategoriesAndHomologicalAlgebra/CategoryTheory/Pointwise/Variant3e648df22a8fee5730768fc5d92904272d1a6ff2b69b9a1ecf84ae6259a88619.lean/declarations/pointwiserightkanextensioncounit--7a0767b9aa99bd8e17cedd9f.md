## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:91f0f57109f8028d17fa711f1131f3f6328da9270616ee53b3a3832a18110bc3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 718–732.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def pointwiseRightKanExtensionCounit :
    L ⋙ pointwiseRightKanExtension L F ⟶ F where
  app X := limit.π (StructuredArrow.proj (L.obj X) L ⋙ F)
    (StructuredArrow.mk (𝟙 (L.obj X)))
  naturality {X₁ X₂} f := by
    simp only [comp_map,
      pointwiseRightKanExtension_map, limit.lift_π, StructuredArrow.map_mk]
    rw [comp_id]
    let φ : StructuredArrow.mk (𝟙 (L.obj X₁)) ⟶ StructuredArrow.mk (L.map f) :=
      StructuredArrow.homMk f
    exact (limit.w (StructuredArrow.proj (L.obj X₁) L ⋙ F) φ).symm

set_option backward.defeqAttrib.useBackward true in
/-- The functor `pointwiseRightKanExtension L F` is a pointwise right Kan
extension of `F` along `L`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Pointwise/Variant3e648df22a8fee5730768fc5d92904272d1a6ff2b69b9a1ecf84ae6259a88619.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Pointwise/Variant3e648df22a8fee5730768fc5d92904272d1a6ff2b69b9a1ecf84ae6259a88619.lean#L718).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `82693388c9e7c4b779e9003526877e01275bfd61` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
