## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ffae11994a6b73271994efb02437eec5a9cd0ac45d2a11dc3370bc9ced63abe6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 101–110.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : IsIso (toPresheafToSheafCompComposeAndSheafify J F) := by
  rw [NatTrans.isIso_iff_isIso_app]
  intro X
  dsimp
  simpa only [← J.W_iff] using J.W_of_preservesSheafification F _ (J.W_toSheafify X)

/-- The canonical isomorphism between `presheafToSheaf J A ⋙ Sheaf.composeAndSheafify J F`
and `(whiskeringRight Cᵒᵖ A B).obj F ⋙ presheafToSheaf J B` when `F : A ⥤ B`
preserves sheafification. -/
@[simps! inv_app]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/PreservesSheafification/Variantd50f50feb7473fe02f5ad77e194fb94244c051e0e30b804e11bed820f0f1ba29.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/PreservesSheafification/Variantd50f50feb7473fe02f5ad77e194fb94244c051e0e30b804e11bed820f0f1ba29.lean#L101).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7aeff8fcbdbf847393b0e4687885552b15c1774f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
