## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f214f23a966fc13a3a20b075454044f0c26a0f0da72b748762550daedb4aa019`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–125.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

end MappingConeCompHomotopyEquiv

/-- Given two composable morphisms `f` and `g` in the category of cochain complexes,
this is the homotopy equivalence `mappingConeCompHomotopyEquiv f g`
between `mappingCone g` and the mapping cone of
the morphism `mappingCone f ⟶ mappingCone (f ≫ g)`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Triangulated/Variant7d2777fa8899fed271eb96a1d912b0b5b591ee67162b35292430c663f0ee59a6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Triangulated/Variant7d2777fa8899fed271eb96a1d912b0b5b591ee67162b35292430c663f0ee59a6.lean#L97).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
