## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b8ce5a64-2bda-5637-f258-dfe5d509ad8f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 170–180.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma mappingConeCompHomotopyEquiv_comm₂ :
    (mappingConeCompHomotopyEquiv f g).hom ≫
      (triangle (mappingConeCompTriangle f g).mor₁).mor₃ =
      (mappingConeCompTriangle f g).mor₃ := by
  ext n
  simp [mappingConeCompHomotopyEquiv, MappingConeCompHomotopyEquiv.hom,
    lift_f _ _ _ _ _ (n + 1) rfl, ext_from_iff _ (n + 1) _ rfl]

set_option backward.defeqAttrib.useBackward true in
set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false in
@[reassoc (attr := simp)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Triangulated/Variant906e671de011520fa9320bcefd52aa3715843fb9cb569b413ef4ea2cf354e1ee.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Triangulated/Variant906e671de011520fa9320bcefd52aa3715843fb9cb569b413ef4ea2cf354e1ee.lean#L170).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `875fa3c35de2ee85a651f92cd2aa33417ccf8015` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
