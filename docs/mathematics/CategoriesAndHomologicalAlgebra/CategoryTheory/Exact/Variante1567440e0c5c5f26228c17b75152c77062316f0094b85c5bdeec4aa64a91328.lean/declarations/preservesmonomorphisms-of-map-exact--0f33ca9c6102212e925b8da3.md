## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:457a5592-c7fb-75b4-65d7-684d23109a56`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 238–244.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem preservesMonomorphisms_of_map_exact : L.PreservesMonomorphisms where
  preserves f hf := by
    apply ((Abelian.tfae_mono (L.map f) (L.obj 0)).out 2 0).mp
    refine ShortComplex.exact_of_iso ?_ (hL _ (((tfae_mono f 0).out 0 2).mp hf))
    exact ShortComplex.isoMk (Iso.refl _) (Iso.refl _) (Iso.refl _)

/-- A functor which preserves exactness preserves epimorphisms. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Exact/Variante1567440e0c5c5f26228c17b75152c77062316f0094b85c5bdeec4aa64a91328.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Exact/Variante1567440e0c5c5f26228c17b75152c77062316f0094b85c5bdeec4aa64a91328.lean#L238).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9d61bc66107b5a0cb6a82ed9ae8aea839662dd0e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
