## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:41b38af2-63d4-be20-304e-9c634b51e283`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 279–287.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem kernel_comp_cokernel (h : Exact f g) : kernel.ι g ≫ cokernel.π f = 0 := by
  suffices Subobject.arrow (kernelSubobject g) ≫ cokernel.π f = 0 by
    rw [← kernelSubobject_arrow', Category.assoc, this, comp_zero]
  haveI := h.epi
  apply zero_of_epi_comp (imageToKernel f g h.w) _
  rw [imageToKernel_arrow_assoc, ← imageSubobject_arrow, Category.assoc, ← Iso.eq_inv_comp]
  aesop_cat
#align category_theory.kernel_comp_cokernel CategoryTheory.kernel_comp_cokernel

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Exact/Variant402a2a70319af9cfde0b74bda7c32a753d4593bdca8e0f50eb8ef1cf8074711b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Exact/Variant402a2a70319af9cfde0b74bda7c32a753d4593bdca8e0f50eb8ef1cf8074711b.lean#L279).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `68dfcf7a0efdc29ab06ad9c363bfa2c165eb6fd5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
