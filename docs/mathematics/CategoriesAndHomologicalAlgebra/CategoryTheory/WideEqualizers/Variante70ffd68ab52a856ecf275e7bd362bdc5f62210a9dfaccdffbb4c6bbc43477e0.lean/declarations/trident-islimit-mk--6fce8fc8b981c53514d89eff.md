## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8831624aad91c06eaf3151efcedb4ea1f3ce42ea9f79a4e1d51f5323d9c777d3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 347–355.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Trident.IsLimit.mk' [Nonempty J] (t : Trident f)
  (create : ∀ s : Trident f, { l // l ≫ t.ι = s.ι ∧ ∀ {m}, m ≫ t.ι = s.ι → m = l }) :
    IsLimit t :=
  Trident.IsLimit.mk t (fun s => (create s).1) (fun s => (create s).2.1) fun s _ w =>
    (create s).2.2 (w zero)
#align category_theory.limits.trident.is_limit.mk' CategoryTheory.Limits.Trident.IsLimit.mk'

/-- This is a slightly more convenient method to verify that a cotrident is a colimit cocone. It
    only asks for a proof of facts that carry any mathematical content -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/WideEqualizers/Variante70ffd68ab52a856ecf275e7bd362bdc5f62210a9dfaccdffbb4c6bbc43477e0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/WideEqualizers/Variante70ffd68ab52a856ecf275e7bd362bdc5f62210a9dfaccdffbb4c6bbc43477e0.lean#L347).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7443ea00d719698d25797724dd883ca195b79d1f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
