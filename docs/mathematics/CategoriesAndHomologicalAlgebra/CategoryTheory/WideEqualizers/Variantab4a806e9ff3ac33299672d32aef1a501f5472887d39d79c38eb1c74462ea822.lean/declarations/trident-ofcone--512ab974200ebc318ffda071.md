## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cfd8ad3da7a6175b1b816a94fedd8f219055be2ad7a6b9c613ac5150d55c99b6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 424–433.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Trident.ofCone {F : WalkingParallelFamily J ⥤ C} (t : Cone F) :
    Trident fun j => F.map (line j) where
  pt := t.pt
  π :=
    { app := fun X => t.π.app X ≫ eqToHom (by cases X <;> aesop_cat)
      naturality := by rintro _ _ (_|_) <;> aesop_cat }

/-- Given `F : WalkingParallelFamily ⥤ C`, which is really the same as
    `parallelFamily (F.map left) (F.map right)` and a cocone on `F`, we get a cotrident on
    `fun j ↦ F.map (line j)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/WideEqualizers/Variantab4a806e9ff3ac33299672d32aef1a501f5472887d39d79c38eb1c74462ea822.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/WideEqualizers/Variantab4a806e9ff3ac33299672d32aef1a501f5472887d39d79c38eb1c74462ea822.lean#L424).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `96ce63dcdfed356fb82ea8b33575faf723386427` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
