## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:430718d2-0fdf-94b1-87eb-fba38ae813a7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 382–395.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Cotrident.IsColimit.homIso_natural [Nonempty J] {t : Cotrident f} {Z Z' : C} (q : Z ⟶ Z')
    (ht : IsColimit t) (k : t.pt ⟶ Z) :
    (Cotrident.IsColimit.homIso ht _ (k ≫ q) : Y ⟶ Z') =
      (Cotrident.IsColimit.homIso ht _ k : Y ⟶ Z) ≫ q :=
  (Category.assoc _ _ _).symm

/-- This is a helper construction that can be useful when verifying that a category has certain wide
    equalizers. Given `F : WalkingParallelFamily ⥤ C`, which is really the same as
    `parallelFamily (fun j ↦ F.map (line j))`, and a trident on `fun j ↦ F.map (line j)`,
    we get a cone on `F`.

    If you're thinking about using this, have a look at
    `hasWideEqualizers_of_hasLimit_parallelFamily`, which you may find to be an easier way of
    achieving your goal. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/WideEqualizers/Variant0034657349d269ac6c49ea7d4be7a7b73cbd1aa61cfba6e2e933f9b314e743bc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/WideEqualizers/Variant0034657349d269ac6c49ea7d4be7a7b73cbd1aa61cfba6e2e933f9b314e743bc.lean#L382).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `09879246e8d3feb7192d71d72bac28b3286b88f9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
