## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:192355d89a1366258b206c4d43f472ce8a99d7cce3738afd695c8b90b7154fb0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 143–167.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance imageToKernel_epi_of_epi_of_zero [HasImages V] [Epi f] :
    Epi (imageToKernel f (0 : B ⟶ C) (by simp)) := by
  simp only [imageToKernel_zero_right]
  have := epi_image_of_epi f
  rw [← imageSubobject_arrow]
  infer_instance

end

section imageToKernel'

/-!
We provide a variant `imageToKernel' : image f ⟶ kernel g`,
and use this to give alternative formulas for `homology f g w`.
-/

variable {A B C : V} (f : A ⟶ B) (g : B ⟶ C) (w : f ≫ g = 0) [HasKernels V] [HasImages V]

/-- While `imageToKernel f g w` provides a morphism
`imageSubobject f ⟶ kernelSubobject g`
in terms of the subobject API,
this variant provides a morphism
`image f ⟶ kernel g`,
which is sometimes more convenient.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ImageToKernel/Variantc5d9d05539d671108131da0bac43c858a1439b5394767cce5cfb2d87b1097c2c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ImageToKernel/Variantc5d9d05539d671108131da0bac43c858a1439b5394767cce5cfb2d87b1097c2c.lean#L143).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ffb728d6d978f553cec0601426fd0845726d31e1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
