## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3e5b873f02258032895b362209e88d348e973ae9122ffa91693e2db24e36c4ae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 116–125.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance colimitMulAction : MulAction R (M F) where
  one_smul x := by
    refine' Quot.inductionOn x _; clear x; intro x; cases' x with j x
    erw [colimit_smul_mk_eq F 1 ⟨j, x⟩, one_smul]
    rfl
  mul_smul r s x := by
    refine' Quot.inductionOn x _; clear x; intro x; cases' x with j x
    erw [colimit_smul_mk_eq F (r * s) ⟨j, x⟩, colimit_smul_mk_eq F s ⟨j, x⟩,
      colimit_smul_mk_eq F r ⟨j, _⟩, mul_smul]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FilteredColimits/Variant4d0481626d2d45a9d269c1eaa233d494ff8be7e65fab59bbb8c4bb91807a4c45.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FilteredColimits/Variant4d0481626d2d45a9d269c1eaa233d494ff8be7e65fab59bbb8c4bb91807a4c45.lean#L116).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `61d2f181ba5fc24d6dd09b727a8a93f91227b123` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
