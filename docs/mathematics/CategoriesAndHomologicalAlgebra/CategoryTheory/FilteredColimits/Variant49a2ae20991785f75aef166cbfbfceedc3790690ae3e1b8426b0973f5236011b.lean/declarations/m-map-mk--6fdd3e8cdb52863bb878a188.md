## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aca2f154-839e-f9e5-4aa0-b4ff43d9f9c9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 78–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma M.map_mk {j k : J} (f : j ⟶ k) (x : F.obj j) :
    M.mk F ⟨k, F.map f x⟩ = M.mk F ⟨j, x⟩ :=
  M.mk_eq _ _ _ ⟨k, 𝟙 _, f, by simp⟩

variable [IsFiltered J]

/-- As `J` is nonempty, we can pick an arbitrary object `j₀ : J`. We use this object to define the
"one" in the colimit as the equivalence class of `⟨j₀, 1 : F.obj j₀⟩`.

  /-- As `J` is nonempty, we can pick an arbitrary object `j₀ : J`. We use this object to
  define the "zero" in the colimit as the equivalence class of `⟨j₀, 0 : F.obj j₀⟩`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FilteredColimits/Variant49a2ae20991785f75aef166cbfbfceedc3790690ae3e1b8426b0973f5236011b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/FilteredColimits/Variant49a2ae20991785f75aef166cbfbfceedc3790690ae3e1b8426b0973f5236011b.lean#L78).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7d15a15af9228eb8a9c7dd58b9594fc194bbe8f1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
