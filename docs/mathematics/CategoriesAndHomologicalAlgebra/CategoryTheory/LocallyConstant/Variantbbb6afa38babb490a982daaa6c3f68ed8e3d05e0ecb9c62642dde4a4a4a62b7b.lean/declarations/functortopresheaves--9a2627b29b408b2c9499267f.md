## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:92c1ff4c2ac96bdd88bfa7e1d8e2d40a9c9ddad7e824978f03d4e0ec10dc44ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 89–99.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def functorToPresheaves : Type (max u w) ⥤ ((CompHausLike.{u} P)ᵒᵖ ⥤ Type max u w) where
  obj X := {
    obj := fun ⟨S⟩ ↦ LocallyConstant S X
    map := fun f g ↦ g.comap f.unop.hom }
  map f := { app := fun _ t ↦ t.map f }

/--
Locally constant maps are the same as continuous maps when the target is equipped with the discrete
topology

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LocallyConstant/Variantbbb6afa38babb490a982daaa6c3f68ed8e3d05e0ecb9c62642dde4a4a4a62b7b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/LocallyConstant/Variantbbb6afa38babb490a982daaa6c3f68ed8e3d05e0ecb9c62642dde4a4a4a62b7b.lean#L89).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `375cc62a9390b28e6ea36723574676663ed021e4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
