## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5923da50f9571d642a2c579243b5702ca957490c637d8d1343541bf908cc7e48`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 576–586.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def constLimAdj : (const J : C ⥤ J ⥤ C) ⊣ lim where
  homEquiv c g :=
    { toFun := fun f => limit.lift _ ⟨c, f⟩
      invFun := fun f =>
        { app := fun j => f ≫ limit.π _ _ }
      left_inv := by aesop_cat
      right_inv := by aesop_cat }
  unit := { app := fun c => limit.lift _ ⟨_, 𝟙 _⟩ }
  counit := { app := fun g => { app := limit.π _ } }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HasLimits/Variantf71d2fa60640e65e0abbc3f58ba1f1ac95a99f88dadc89a82d529bef140893a1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HasLimits/Variantf71d2fa60640e65e0abbc3f58ba1f1ac95a99f88dadc89a82d529bef140893a1.lean#L576).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f3a1506080c39901e54ba4f9dc3968a9c13af066` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
