## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4c566a19f185c16e7d561402fe48e20a17f8e7b4312cedf0d7fe80f1a07201f7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 628–645.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance limMap_mono {F G : J ⥤ C} [HasLimit F] [HasLimit G] (α : F ⟶ G) [∀ j, Mono (α.app j)] :
    Mono (limMap α) :=
  ⟨fun {Z} u v h =>
    limit.hom_ext fun j => (cancel_mono (α.app j)).1 <| by simpa using h =≫ limit.π _ j⟩

section Adjunction

variable {L : (J ⥤ C) ⥤ C} (adj : Functor.const _ ⊣ L)

/- The fact that the existence of limits of shape `J` is equivalent to the existence
of a right adjoint to the constant functor `C ⥤ (J ⥤ C)` is obtained in
the file `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Limits/ConeCategory.lean`: see the lemma
`hasLimitsOfShape_iff_isLeftAdjoint_const`. In the definitions below, given an
adjunction `adj : Functor.const _ ⊣ (L : (J ⥤ C) ⥤ C)`, we directly construct
a limit cone for any `F : J ⥤ C`. -/

/-- The limit cone obtained from a right adjoint of the constant functor. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HasLimits/Variantd6020e48c1b21bc94a570c2243c4d73d2f1743d51f3f90d1163836292d0ef1a0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HasLimits/Variantd6020e48c1b21bc94a570c2243c4d73d2f1743d51f3f90d1163836292d0ef1a0.lean#L628).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d170ba85d5915c678b9364ed5ee86a2690e92383` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
