## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:17e8839d-b720-183e-a9f9-4887029f74c4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 612–623.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasLimitsOfShape_of_equivalence {J' : Type u₂} [Category.{v₂} J'] (e : J ≌ J')
    [HasLimitsOfShape J C] : HasLimitsOfShape J' C := by
  constructor
  intro F
  apply hasLimitOfEquivalenceComp e
#align category_theory.limits.has_limits_of_shape_of_equivalence CategoryTheory.Limits.hasLimitsOfShape_of_equivalence

variable (C)

/-- `hasLimitsOfSizeShrink.{v u} C` tries to obtain `HasLimitsOfSize.{v u} C`
from some other `HasLimitsOfSize C`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HasLimits/Variantae30c35eb21a8cbc855a62691009e29e71130b9f34d02c49b9e9c779f14af2a8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HasLimits/Variantae30c35eb21a8cbc855a62691009e29e71130b9f34d02c49b9e9c779f14af2a8.lean#L612).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c02b9fb180ef8d6b041e563b8e878c11a03d3a0a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
