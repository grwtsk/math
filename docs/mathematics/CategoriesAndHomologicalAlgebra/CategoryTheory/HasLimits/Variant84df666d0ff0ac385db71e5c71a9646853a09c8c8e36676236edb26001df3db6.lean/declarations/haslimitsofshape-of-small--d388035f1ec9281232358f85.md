## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9cf7c917-d0ed-e58e-7623-d32af69413e2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 685–693.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma HasLimitsOfShape.of_small
    [HasLimitsOfSize.{v₁, u₁} C] (J : Type u₂) [Category.{v₂} J]
    [Small.{u₁} J] [LocallySmall.{v₁} J] :
    HasLimitsOfShape J C := by
  have := HasLimitsOfSize.has_limits_of_shape (C := C) (ShrinkHoms (Shrink.{u₁} J))
  exact hasLimitsOfShape_of_equivalence
    ((ShrinkHoms.equivalence _).symm.trans (Shrink.equivalence _).symm)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HasLimits/Variant84df666d0ff0ac385db71e5c71a9646853a09c8c8e36676236edb26001df3db6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HasLimits/Variant84df666d0ff0ac385db71e5c71a9646853a09c8c8e36676236edb26001df3db6.lean#L685).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e660253d98b1ff988ef969d2a3f6a96995292573` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
