## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:36da7c2c0325da403a5faa86c73c8945e4a5e9217a83373a6f2b8e8e0b7a8fa7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 498–502.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def limYoneda :
    lim ⋙ yoneda ⋙ (whiskeringRight _ _ _).obj uliftFunctor.{u₁} ≅ CategoryTheory.cones J C :=
  NatIso.ofComponents fun F => NatIso.ofComponents fun W => limit.homIso F (unop W)

/-- The constant functor and limit functor are adjoint to each other -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HasLimits/Variant536afaf0d8419e75a112c8ef1d1d04f02a4d473b7e26089865b996261127a2c5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/HasLimits/Variant536afaf0d8419e75a112c8ef1d1d04f02a4d473b7e26089865b996261127a2c5.lean#L498).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dd538ff84800a39510ea53f93f64ffcefebd3f44` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
