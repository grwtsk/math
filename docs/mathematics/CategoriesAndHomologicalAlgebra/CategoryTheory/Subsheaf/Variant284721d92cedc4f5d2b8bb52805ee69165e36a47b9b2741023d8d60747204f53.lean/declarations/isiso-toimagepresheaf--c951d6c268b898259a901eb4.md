## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2fd976db97f496d4c7d74c2863b1029c4d2a4c5b913df54852705b9cb0e3707f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 385–401.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isIso_toImagePresheaf {F F' : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ TypeMax.{v, w}} (f : F ⟶ F') [hf : Mono f] :
  IsIso (toImagePresheaf f) := by
  have : ∀ (X : Cᵒᵖ), IsIso ((toImagePresheaf f).app X) := by
    intro X
    rw [isIso_iff_bijective]
    constructor
    · intro x y e
      have := (NatTrans.mono_iff_mono_app _ _).mp hf X
      rw [mono_iff_injective] at this
      exact this (congr_arg Subtype.val e : _)
    · rintro ⟨_, ⟨x, rfl⟩⟩
      exact ⟨x, rfl⟩
  apply NatIso.isIso_of_isIso_app

/-- The image sheaf of a morphism between sheaves, defined to be the sheafification of
`image_presheaf`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Subsheaf/Variant284721d92cedc4f5d2b8bb52805ee69165e36a47b9b2741023d8d60747204f53.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Subsheaf/Variant284721d92cedc4f5d2b8bb52805ee69165e36a47b9b2741023d8d60747204f53.lean#L385).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `117af275faa0934952fb1cd28e0bf3b1fade2e1d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
