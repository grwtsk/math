## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6507eba1-b2a0-e7b3-21a8-0a267e7b8e52`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 74–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma preservesTerminal_of_isSheaf_for_empty (hI : IsInitial I) :
    PreservesLimit (Functor.empty.{0} Cᵒᵖ) F :=
  have := hI.hasInitial
  (preservesTerminal_of_iso F
    ((F.mapIso (terminalIsoIsTerminal (terminalOpOfInitial initialIsInitial)) ≪≫
    (F.mapIso (initialIsoIsInitial hI).symm.op) ≪≫
    (terminalIsoIsTerminal (isTerminal_of_isSheafFor_empty_presieve I F hF)).symm)))

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Preserves/Variant497017c7b7329090b2d93df565bc4b5f4455facde724fc416983bea214976236.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Preserves/Variant497017c7b7329090b2d93df565bc4b5f4455facde724fc416983bea214976236.lean#L74).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77594f50c2b30a5df231bd05bb8cab8be6cc90f8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
