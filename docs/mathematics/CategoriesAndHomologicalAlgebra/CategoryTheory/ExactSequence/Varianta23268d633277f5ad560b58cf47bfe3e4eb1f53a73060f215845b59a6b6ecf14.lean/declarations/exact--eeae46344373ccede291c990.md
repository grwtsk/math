## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f816f20c-3435-3b75-5365-c8fc280c9314`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 272–280.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Exact.δ₀ {S : ComposableArrows C (n + 2)} (hS : S.Exact) :
    S.δ₀.Exact := by
  rw [exact_iff_δ₀] at hS
  exact hS.2

/-- If `S : ComposableArrows C (n + 2)` is such that the first two arrows form
an exact sequence and that the tail `S.δ₀` is exact, then `S` is also exact.
See `ShortComplex.SnakeInput.snake_lemma` in `Algebra.Homology.ShortComplex.SnakeLemma`
for a use of this lemma. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ExactSequence/Varianta23268d633277f5ad560b58cf47bfe3e4eb1f53a73060f215845b59a6b6ecf14.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/ExactSequence/Varianta23268d633277f5ad560b58cf47bfe3e4eb1f53a73060f215845b59a6b6ecf14.lean#L272).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d76c1c67ed1f6c794425376082466418eeea8623` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
