## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6d9a4fe4c25dfb01d39f9f3b9a5afe5ae4b807b008c4a4e49bc26a281f5878ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 305–312.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev PushoutCocone (f : X ⟶ Y) (g : X ⟶ Z) :=
  Cocone (span f g)

namespace PushoutCocone

variable {f : X ⟶ Y} {g : X ⟶ Z}

/-- The first inclusion of a pushout cocone. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/PullbackCone/Variante7b0b6c1d71bd8e5666d5c558c89d636db071224b906a3ed86b4a42cd28bd24a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/PullbackCone/Variante7b0b6c1d71bd8e5666d5c558c89d636db071224b906a3ed86b4a42cd28bd24a.lean#L305).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9a629703f468e9f0fd327742c0848f310a5675e1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
