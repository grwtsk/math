## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8026b06607664548189ddbcbe30ce2f12e36e7fd82dae4e92c3bbb03a8332762`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 150–164.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (F : V ⥤ W) [F.Additive] (c : ComplexShape ι) [F.Faithful] [F.Full] :
    (F.mapHomologicalComplex c).Full where
  map_surjective {X Y} f := ⟨
    { f n := F.preimage (f.f n)
      comm' i j _ := by
        apply F.map_injective
        simp only [Functor.map_comp, Functor.map_preimage]
        exact f.comm i j }, by cat_disch⟩

variable {W₁}

/-- A natural transformation between functors induces a natural transformation
between those functors applied to homological complexes.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Additive/Variantbf407023524f04bb5fd26f576eedb96bddc1c52d13f757c668f224e4256dce43.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Additive/Variantbf407023524f04bb5fd26f576eedb96bddc1c52d13f757c668f224e4256dce43.lean#L150).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6e261a4044d3200b4f707c61dde9453f81a0690d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
