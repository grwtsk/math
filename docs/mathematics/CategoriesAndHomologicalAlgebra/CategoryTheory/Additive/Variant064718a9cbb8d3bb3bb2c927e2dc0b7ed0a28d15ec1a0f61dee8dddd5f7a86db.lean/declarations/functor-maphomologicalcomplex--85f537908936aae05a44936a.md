## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d36278b2604e37b904273415641578d6c9fbe8b4d612bb1eada034c0cf406b98`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 153–173.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Functor.mapHomologicalComplex (F : V ⥤ W) [F.Additive] (c : ComplexShape ι) :
    HomologicalComplex V c ⥤ HomologicalComplex W c where
  obj C :=
    { X := fun i => F.obj (C.X i)
      d := fun i j => F.map (C.d i j)
      shape := fun i j w => by
        dsimp only
        rw [C.shape _ _ w, F.map_zero]
      d_comp_d' := fun i j k _ _ => by rw [← F.map_comp, C.d_comp_d, F.map_zero] }
  map f :=
    { f := fun i => F.map (f.f i)
      comm' := fun i j _ => by
        dsimp
        rw [← F.map_comp, ← F.map_comp, f.comm] }

variable (V)

/-- The functor on homological complexes induced by the identity functor is
isomorphic to the identity functor. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Additive/Variant064718a9cbb8d3bb3bb2c927e2dc0b7ed0a28d15ec1a0f61dee8dddd5f7a86db.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Additive/Variant064718a9cbb8d3bb3bb2c927e2dc0b7ed0a28d15ec1a0f61dee8dddd5f7a86db.lean#L153).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `73413473259ac0e5ec4bcd4872c88e8790dd715b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
