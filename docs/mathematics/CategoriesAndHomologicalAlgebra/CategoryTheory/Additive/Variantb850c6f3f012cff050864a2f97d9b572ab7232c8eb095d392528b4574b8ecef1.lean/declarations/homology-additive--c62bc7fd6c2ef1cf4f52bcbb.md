## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2ed303f6631fb40af75f5cfcbf04149abe66f669f27a2ae9efc24cfdb7341305`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 141–160.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance homology_additive : (homologyFunctor V c i).Additive where
  map_add {_ _ f g} := by
    dsimp [homologyFunctor]
    ext
    simp only [homology.π_map, Preadditive.comp_add, ← Preadditive.add_comp]
    congr
    ext
    simp
#align homological_complex.homology_additive HomologicalComplex.homology_additive

end HomologicalComplex

namespace CategoryTheory

variable {W : Type*} [Category W] [Preadditive W]

/-- An additive functor induces a functor between homological complexes.
This is sometimes called the "prolongation".

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Additive/Variantb850c6f3f012cff050864a2f97d9b572ab7232c8eb095d392528b4574b8ecef1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CategoriesAndHomologicalAlgebra/CategoryTheory/Additive/Variantb850c6f3f012cff050864a2f97d9b572ab7232c8eb095d392528b4574b8ecef1.lean#L141).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1be67baae8d6de14793968eb63cb74711ba05917` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
