## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ef7ff574-5bb8-6c79-bb25-3aff36abf5b2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 147–156.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem inventory_compressed_32 (bits : Nat) (bound : bits ≤ maxFileBits) :
    checkedUsize 32 (compressedByteLen bits) = some (compressedByteLen bits) := by
  apply (checkedUsize_eq_some_iff _ _ _).mpr
  have h := inventory_compressed_bound bits bound
  change compressedByteLen bits ≤ 1069547520 at h
  exact ⟨by omega, rfl⟩

/-- A natural-to-word cast is exact under the structural 255-bit path bound.
The source now additionally checks `u64::try_from(code.len())`; the following
checked-conversion theorem states that explicit success condition. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/InformationTheory/SourceCoding/Lossless/PrefixCodes/Huffman/Bounds.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/InformationTheory/Huffman/Bounds.lean#L147).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cb9bf59c507e727aef8d34827adf353c3f1ab108` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
