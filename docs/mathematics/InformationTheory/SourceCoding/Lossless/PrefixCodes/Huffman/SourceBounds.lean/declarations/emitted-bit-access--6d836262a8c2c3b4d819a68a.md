## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8ddd5e61-acbb-4de0-47a1-aa4a8faaf2bf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 121–133.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem emitted_bit_access (source : List UInt8) (wordBits position : Nat)
    (guard : checkedUsize wordBits (encode source).bitCount = some (encode source).bitCount)
    (beforeEnd : position < (encode source).bitCount) :
    position + 1 < 2 ^ wordBits ∧ position / 8 < (encode source).bytes.length ∧
      7 - position % 8 < 8 := by
  have capacity := ((checkedUsize_eq_some_iff _ _ _).mp guard).1
  refine ⟨position_successor_fits wordBits position _ capacity beforeEnd, ?_,
    packed_shift_bound position⟩
  have hi := packed_index_bound position (encode source).bitCount beforeEnd
  simpa only [encode, Wire.pack_length, compressedByteLen_eq_ceil] using hi

/-- The decoder's next valid output prefix cannot overflow its observed
histogram or exceed the final declared symbol frequency. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/InformationTheory/SourceCoding/Lossless/PrefixCodes/Huffman/SourceBounds.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/InformationTheory/Huffman/SourceBounds.lean#L121).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7f9d211c537919baa83f6ecefd0aa4431b354e78` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
