## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:42c907aa1c99304b6bad85358db5156faf728bc8229a5cef4876ea9d05703c2b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 141–158.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def skyscraperPresheafCoconeOfSpecializes {y : X} (h : p₀ ⤳ y) :
    Cocone ((OpenNhds.inclusion y).op ⋙ skyscraperPresheaf p₀ A) where
  pt := A
  ι :=
    { app := fun U => eqToHom <| ite_eq_left <| h.mem_open U.unop.1.2 U.unop.2
      naturality := fun U V inc => by

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/Skyscraper/Variant39935df84b0fa1f5529f877d1225140a5b9ab9e20787e99a8d9fee1652c74dd2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/Skyscraper/Variant39935df84b0fa1f5529f877d1225140a5b9ab9e20787e99a8d9fee1652c74dd2.lean#L141).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8aee7657d15061ea2f3a6209a96051e28423c662` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
