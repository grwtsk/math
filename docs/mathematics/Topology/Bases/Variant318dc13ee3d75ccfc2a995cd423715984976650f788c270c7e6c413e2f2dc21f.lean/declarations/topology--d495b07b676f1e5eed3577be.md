## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:16d60073890a0a37313ccaf27e101f8b4bfd0be8ae103182028ca6eed32c633d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 247–257.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def topology [Nonempty ι] (hB : SubmodulesRingBasis B) : TopologicalSpace A :=
  hB.toRing_subgroups_basis.topology
#align submodules_ring_basis.topology SubmodulesRingBasis.topology

end SubmodulesRingBasis

variable {M : Type*} [AddCommGroup M] [Module R M]

/-- A family of submodules in an `R`-module `M` is a submodules basis if it satisfies
some axioms ensuring there is a topology on `M` which is compatible with the module structure and
admits this family as a basis of neighborhoods of zero. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/Bases/Variant318dc13ee3d75ccfc2a995cd423715984976650f788c270c7e6c413e2f2dc21f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/Bases/Variant318dc13ee3d75ccfc2a995cd423715984976650f788c270c7e6c413e2f2dc21f.lean#L247).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c149838e3b14ebc4d39426e8091b745f9194d99` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
