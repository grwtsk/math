## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b30b0f01-4f47-5170-e389-aa7be5ec186e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 335–363.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nonarchimedean (hB : SubmodulesBasis B) : @NonarchimedeanAddGroup M _ hB.topology := by
  let := hB.topology

  intro U hU

  exact ⟨hB.openAddSubgroup i, hi⟩

library_note «non-Archimedean non-instances» /--
The non-Archimedean subgroup basis lemmas cannot be instances because some instances
(such as `MeasureTheory.AEEqFun.instAddMonoid` or `IsTopologicalAddGroup.toContinuousAdd`)
cause the search for `@IsTopologicalAddGroup β ?m1 ?m2`, i.e. a search for a topological group where
the topology/group structure are unknown. -/


end SubmodulesBasis

section

/-
In this section, we check that in an `R`-algebra `A` over a ring equipped with a topology,
a basis of `R`-submodules which is compatible with the topology on `R` is also a submodule basis
in the sense of `R`-modules (forgetting about the ring structure on `A`) and those two points of
view definitionaly gives the same topology on `A`.

include hB hsmul

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/Bases/Variant968acb1b1caed1a3acdab98f1edfccc6be152e84024dfa673bbbc378f15c1ddd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/Bases/Variant968acb1b1caed1a3acdab98f1edfccc6be152e84024dfa673bbbc378f15c1ddd.lean#L335).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1f57b93827036112f888d959dc0b0635b8560d41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
