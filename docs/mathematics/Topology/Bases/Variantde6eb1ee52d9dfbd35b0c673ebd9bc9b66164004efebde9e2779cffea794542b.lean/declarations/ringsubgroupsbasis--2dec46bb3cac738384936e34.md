## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2249bc61b47e60570f6c6bb7c24b97515819bf046141dcecfff6ceff05ee9b24`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 37–54.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure RingSubgroupsBasis {A ι : Type*} [Ring A] (B : ι → AddSubgroup A) : Prop where
  /-- Condition for `B` to be a filter basis on `A`. -/
  inter : ∀ i j, ∃ k, B k ≤ B i ⊓ B j
  /-- For each set `B` in the submodule basis on `A`, there is another basis element `B'` such
   that the set-theoretic product `B' * B'` is in `B`. -/
  mul : ∀ i, ∃ j, (B j : Set A) * B j ⊆ B i
  /-- For any element `x : A` and any set `B` in the submodule basis on `A`,
    there is another basis element `B'` such that `B' * x` is in `B`. -/
  leftMul : ∀ x : A, ∀ i, ∃ j, (B j : Set A) ⊆ (x * ·) ⁻¹' B i
  /-- For any element `x : A` and any set `B` in the submodule basis on `A`,
    there is another basis element `B'` such that `x * B'` is in `B`. -/
  rightMul : ∀ x : A, ∀ i, ∃ j, (B j : Set A) ⊆ (· * x) ⁻¹' B i

variable {A ι : Type*} [Ring A]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/Bases/Variantde6eb1ee52d9dfbd35b0c673ebd9bc9b66164004efebde9e2779cffea794542b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/Bases/Variantde6eb1ee52d9dfbd35b0c673ebd9bc9b66164004efebde9e2779cffea794542b.lean#L37).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `984977b3e2a612a34a43d9e0028851d2a2084ba3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
