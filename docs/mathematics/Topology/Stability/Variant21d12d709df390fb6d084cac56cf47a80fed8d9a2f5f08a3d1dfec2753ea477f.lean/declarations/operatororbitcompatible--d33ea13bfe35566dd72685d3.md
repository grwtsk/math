## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d6c2bc7c2c6d1760412c59896d3cd743f1ce1af4323d6467c76671b0c9d76b2b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–119.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def OperatorOrbitCompatible
    [PseudoMetricSpace State]
    {operator : VersionedOperator State}
    (Symmetry : Type v)
    [Group Symmetry]
    [MulAction Symmetry operator.domain] : Prop :=
  ∀ (groupElement : Symmetry)
    (state : operator.domain),
    operator.step (groupElement • state) =
      groupElement • operator.step state

/-- Distance to a finite group orbit. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/Stability/Variant21d12d709df390fb6d084cac56cf47a80fed8d9a2f5f08a3d1dfec2753ea477f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/Stability/Variant21d12d709df390fb6d084cac56cf47a80fed8d9a2f5f08a3d1dfec2753ea477f.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `45ee170f2a8448df257fd77cec84643df54ce756` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
