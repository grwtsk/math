## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5110a50b-3709-e95e-1d8e-5f0c12f57a49`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 72–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem preregular [HasExplicitPullbacks P]
    (hs : ∀ ⦃X Y : CompHausLike P⦄ (f : X ⟶ Y), EffectiveEpi f → Function.Surjective f) :
    Preregular (CompHausLike P) where
  exists_fac := by
    intro X Y Z f π hπ
    refine ⟨pullback f π, pullback.fst f π, ⟨⟨effectiveEpiStruct _ ?_⟩⟩, pullback.snd f π,
      (pullback.condition _ _).symm⟩
    intro y
    obtain ⟨z, hz⟩ := hs π hπ (f y)
    exact ⟨⟨(y, z), hz.symm⟩, rfl⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/EffectiveEpi/Variantd91100be207fe9577035a2d75526ab1d6dc2ec788fa975b1b12f8da3946a3f1d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/EffectiveEpi/Variantd91100be207fe9577035a2d75526ab1d6dc2ec788fa975b1b12f8da3946a3f1d.lean#L72).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fa7373eb17b5d87fafcdb9c9e9eb7bc7355b87d4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
