## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ce04c8f23eb4aa00deca7422c1804cea33c85c58915212c34fc53534e68827dc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 139–149.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def submonoidPresheafOfStalk (S : ∀ x : X, Submonoid (F.stalk x)) :
    F.SubmonoidPresheaf where
  obj U := ⨅ x : U.unop, Submonoid.comap (F.germ U.unop x.1 x.2).hom (S x)
  map {U V} i := by
    intro s hs
    simp only [Submonoid.mem_comap, Submonoid.mem_iInf] at hs ⊢
    intro x
    change (F.map i.unop.op ≫ F.germ V.unop x.1 x.2) s ∈ _
    rw [F.germ_res]
    exact hs ⟨_, i.unop.le x.2⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/CommRingCat/Variant8fbb62d772f43752bc35249a71cac36b5a09fe9d167d3f7689c5c0ddcb03d83c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/CommRingCat/Variant8fbb62d772f43752bc35249a71cac36b5a09fe9d167d3f7689c5c0ddcb03d83c.lean#L139).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `70c2b3a37ba4774d4b70fc0a65ae3dee405ed92a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
