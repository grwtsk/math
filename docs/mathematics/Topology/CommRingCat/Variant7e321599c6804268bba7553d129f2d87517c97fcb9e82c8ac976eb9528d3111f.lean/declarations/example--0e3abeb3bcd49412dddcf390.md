## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5395a22f576362366bc042d91f54f9d278adb015a695de4d1f71d799636dc761`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 53–69.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example (X : TopCat.{u₁}) (F : Presheaf CommRingCat.{u₁} X)
    (h : Presheaf.IsSheaf (F ⋙ (forget CommRingCat))) :
    F.IsSheaf :=
(isSheaf_iff_isSheaf_comp (forget CommRingCat) F).mpr h

/-- Deprecated: usage of this definition should be replaceable with `TopCat.Presheaf.restrictOpen`.

Before, we had to specialze `restrictOpen` to `CommRingCat` because inferring `C := CommRingCat`
was not reliable. Unification hints appear to solve that issue.

The following still holds for `restrictOpen`: instead of unfolding the definition, rewrite with
`restrictOpenCommRingCat_apply` to ensure the correct coercion to functions is taken.

(The correct fix in the longer term is to redesign concrete categories so we don't use `forget`
everywhere, but the correct `FunLike` instance for the morphisms of those categories.)

@[deprecated TopCat.Presheaf.restrictOpen (since := "2024-12-19")]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/CommRingCat/Variant7e321599c6804268bba7553d129f2d87517c97fcb9e82c8ac976eb9528d3111f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/CommRingCat/Variant7e321599c6804268bba7553d129f2d87517c97fcb9e82c8ac976eb9528d3111f.lean#L53).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1bc2af5c7919623710f8831682b9a257b58de714` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
