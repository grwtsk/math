## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7786e5c0a4a77d9f8ffbf9310c33a601c20a1caf8591d21e3c186a8c362819e8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 504–510.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def pushforwardPullbackAdjunction {X Y : TopCat.{v}} (f : X ⟶ Y) :
  pullback C f ⊣ pushforward C f :=
  Lan.adjunction _ _
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false in
#align Top.presheaf.pushforward_pullback_adjunction TopCat.Presheaf.pushforwardPullbackAdjunction

/-- Pulling back along a homeomorphism is the same as pushing forward along its inverse. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/Presheaf/Variant8294d1b9db76e3434d977fa666d76b70fb0ba79cab7a9281a9256bdf5daa5ec3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/Presheaf/Variant8294d1b9db76e3434d977fa666d76b70fb0ba79cab7a9281a9256bdf5daa5ec3.lean#L504).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `624ac71332f87878b5a09ffb110b5adc6acb864c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
