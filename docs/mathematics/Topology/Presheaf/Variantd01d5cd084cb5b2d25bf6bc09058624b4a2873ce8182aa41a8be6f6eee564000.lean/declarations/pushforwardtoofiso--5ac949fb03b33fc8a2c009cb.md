## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:27f02f0b4cfb41f673ff60adae3021a672f77e6b7f9dba7685f43de10314c00a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 269–275.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def pushforwardToOfIso {X Y : TopCat.{w}} (H₁ : X ≅ Y) {ℱ : Y.Presheaf C} {𝒢 : X.Presheaf C}
    (H₂ : ℱ ⟶ H₁.hom _* 𝒢) : H₁.inv _* ℱ ⟶ 𝒢 :=
  ((presheafEquivOfIso _ H₁.symm).toAdjunction.homEquiv ℱ 𝒢).symm H₂

set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency.types false in
set_option backward.defeqAttrib.useBackward true in
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/Presheaf/Variantd01d5cd084cb5b2d25bf6bc09058624b4a2873ce8182aa41a8be6f6eee564000.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/Presheaf/Variantd01d5cd084cb5b2d25bf6bc09058624b4a2873ce8182aa41a8be6f6eee564000.lean#L269).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5444303c843083eca5e6b9d5002114d95c8343b0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
