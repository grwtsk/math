## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d3d63c676bb99d5fb2922ca6e0ed3911b550bb818a1473860bafd2d393d1d3cf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 245–253.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class RingFilterBasis (R : Type u) [Ring R] extends AddGroupFilterBasis R where
  mul' : ∀ {U}, U ∈ sets → ∃ V ∈ sets, V * V ⊆ U
  mul_left' : ∀ (x₀ : R) {U}, U ∈ sets → ∃ V ∈ sets, V ⊆ (fun x ↦ x₀ * x) ⁻¹' U
  mul_right' : ∀ (x₀ : R) {U}, U ∈ sets → ∃ V ∈ sets, V ⊆ (fun x ↦ x * x₀) ⁻¹' U

namespace RingFilterBasis

variable {R : Type u} [Ring R] (B : RingFilterBasis R)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/FilterBasis/Variantbb2257b106eaef760e9c82635eec75a647fcbcf4cab90459286ed9b2df0a902b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/FilterBasis/Variantbb2257b106eaef760e9c82635eec75a647fcbcf4cab90459286ed9b2df0a902b.lean#L245).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b7caf0144c9aa0c10f4b48059ff7b54c578b4ea4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
