## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d1f83c6006cb01b87acb7f0882174ffe1a5528343527f2d3287010c0bc9f8d87`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 323–344.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [DiscreteTopology R] : Inhabited (ModuleFilterBasis R M) :=
  ⟨{
      show AddGroupFilterBasis M from
        default with
      smul' := by
        rintro U (rfl : U ∈ {{(0 : M)}})
        use univ, univ_mem, {0}, rfl
        rintro a ⟨x, -, m, rfl, rfl⟩
        simp only [smul_zero, mem_singleton_iff]
      smul_left' := by
        rintro x₀ U (h : U ∈ {{(0 : M)}})
        rw [mem_singleton_iff] at h
        use {0}, rfl
        simp [h]
      smul_right' := by
        rintro m₀ U (h : U ∈ (0 : Set (Set M)))
        rw [Set.mem_zero] at h
        simp [h, nhds_discrete] }⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/FilterBasis/Variantbe8a10bb4c658e8e64fc071937311bd22c7555d4d7d0346cc8ee72da8c2866bf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/FilterBasis/Variantbe8a10bb4c658e8e64fc071937311bd22c7555d4d7d0346cc8ee72da8c2866bf.lean#L323).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `075be3f89eef066d88fb74cde58229f1af98ccb0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
