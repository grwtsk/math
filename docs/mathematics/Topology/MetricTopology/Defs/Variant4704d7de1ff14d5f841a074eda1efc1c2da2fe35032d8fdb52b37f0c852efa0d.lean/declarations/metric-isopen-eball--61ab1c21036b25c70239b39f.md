## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:714bf69c-038b-c540-575d-7806769f2c47`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 190–205.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] theorem Metric.isOpen_eball {r : ℝ≥0∞} : IsOpen (eball x r) := by
  apply EMetric.isOpen_iff.mpr fun y hy ↦ ?_
  refine ⟨r - edist x y, by simp_all [PseudoEMetricSpace.edist_comm], fun a ha ↦ ?_⟩
  simp only [mem_eball, PseudoEMetricSpace.edist_comm y x] at hy ha ⊢
  grw [PseudoEMetricSpace.edist_triangle a y x, PseudoEMetricSpace.edist_comm y x,
    ← tsub_add_cancel_of_le hy.le, (ENNReal.add_lt_add_iff_right (LT.lt.ne_top hy)).mpr ha]

end

/-- A `WeakPseudoEMetricSpace` is a topological space endowed with a `ℝ≥0∞`-value distance `edist`
which is *almost* an extended pseudometric space: the `edist` is reflexive, commutative and
satisfies the triangle inequality, but the topology on `α` need not *equal* the topology induced
by the `edist`. (It must be at least as fine, and agree with it on eballs of finite radius.)

This generalises both pseudo extended metric spaces and `ℝ≥0∞` (which have an extended distance,
which does not induce the order topology there). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Defs/Variant4704d7de1ff14d5f841a074eda1efc1c2da2fe35032d8fdb52b37f0c852efa0d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Defs/Variant4704d7de1ff14d5f841a074eda1efc1c2da2fe35032d8fdb52b37f0c852efa0d.lean#L190).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ef0db6a6a6d35e7777c6a0769a4af5ddcdfdadf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
