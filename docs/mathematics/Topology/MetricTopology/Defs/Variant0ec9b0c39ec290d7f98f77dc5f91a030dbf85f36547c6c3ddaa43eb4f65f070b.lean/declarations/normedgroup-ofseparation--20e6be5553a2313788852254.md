## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:826f9a7c3ed25668271df77323ff8ad5bbdaf3d82c2f6d1e5a3fbb9ac2eba3e8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 296–311.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev NormedGroup.ofSeparation [SeminormedGroup E] (h : ∀ x : E, ‖x‖ = 0 → x = 1) :
    NormedGroup E where
  dist_eq := ‹SeminormedGroup E›.dist_eq
  toMetricSpace :=
    { eq_of_dist_eq_zero := fun hxy =>
        inv_mul_eq_one.1 <| h _ <| (‹SeminormedGroup E›.dist_eq _ _).symm.trans hxy }

-- See note [reducible non-instances]
/-- Construct a `NormedCommGroup` from a `SeminormedCommGroup` satisfying
`∀ x, ‖x‖ = 0 → x = 1`. This avoids having to go back to the `(Pseudo)MetricSpace` level when
declaring a `NormedCommGroup` instance as a special case of a more general `SeminormedCommGroup`
instance. -/
@[to_additive /-- Construct a `NormedAddCommGroup` from a
`SeminormedAddCommGroup` satisfying `∀ x, ‖x‖ = 0 → x = 0`. This avoids having to go back to the
`(Pseudo)MetricSpace` level when declaring a `NormedAddCommGroup` instance as a special case
of a more general `SeminormedAddCommGroup` instance. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Defs/Variant0ec9b0c39ec290d7f98f77dc5f91a030dbf85f36547c6c3ddaa43eb4f65f070b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Defs/Variant0ec9b0c39ec290d7f98f77dc5f91a030dbf85f36547c6c3ddaa43eb4f65f070b.lean#L296).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `968586593512aa16616ed5bf4d48d06f58281518` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
