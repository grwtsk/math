## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:61a7da42290e3aa8dc661439eaab4518bbc0c0fcca8aa3b2b8cfc614052eec64`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–77.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def uniformSpaceOfEDist (edist : α → α → ℝ≥0∞) (edist_self : ∀ x : α, edist x x = 0)
    (edist_comm : ∀ x y : α, edist x y = edist y x)
    (edist_triangle : ∀ x y z : α, edist x z ≤ edist x y + edist y z) : UniformSpace α :=
  .ofFun edist edist_self edist_comm edist_triangle fun ε ε0 =>
    ⟨ε / 2, ENNReal.half_pos ε0.ne', fun _ h₁ _ h₂ =>
      (ENNReal.add_lt_add h₁ h₂).trans_eq (ENNReal.add_halves _)⟩

/-- A pseudo extended metric space is a type endowed with a `ℝ≥0∞`-valued distance `edist`
satisfying reflexivity `edist x x = 0`, commutativity `edist x y = edist y x`, and the triangle
inequality `edist x z ≤ edist x y + edist y z`.

Note that we do not require `edist x y = 0 → x = y`. See extended metric spaces (`EMetricSpace`) for
the similar class with that stronger assumption.

Any pseudo extended metric space is a topological space and a uniform space (see `TopologicalSpace`,
`UniformSpace`), where the topology and uniformity come from the metric.
Note that a T1 pseudo extended metric space is just an extended metric space.

We make the uniformity/topology part of the data instead of deriving it from the metric. This eg
ensures that we do not get a diamond when doing
`[PseudoEMetricSpace α] [PseudoEMetricSpace β] : TopologicalSpace (α × β)`:
The product metric and product topology agree, but not definitionally so.
See Note [forgetful inheritance]. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Defs/Variant1427730d4123217959b6180db86bf28c30d5edd269a3d1b904a3939a95ec7656.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Defs/Variant1427730d4123217959b6180db86bf28c30d5edd269a3d1b904a3939a95ec7656.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6459c590098c67e05b4eb7979db41cd8443f386c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
