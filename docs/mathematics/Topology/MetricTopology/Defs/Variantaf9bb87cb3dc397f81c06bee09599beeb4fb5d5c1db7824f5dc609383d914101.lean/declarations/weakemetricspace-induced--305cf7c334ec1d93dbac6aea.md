## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bd7f98f763f753c4f877cdd1a0bfa30375c3394d4e8a0126b0b7f1a0d9bd4de9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 966–974.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev WeakEMetricSpace.induced
  {α β : Type*} [n : TopologicalSpace β]
  {f : α → β} (hf : Function.Injective f) (m : WeakEMetricSpace β) :
    @WeakEMetricSpace α (TopologicalSpace.induced f n) :=
  letI := TopologicalSpace.induced f n
  { WeakPseudoEMetricSpace.IsInducing (f := f) {eq_induced := rfl} m.toWeakPseudoEMetricSpace with
    eq_of_edist_eq_zero := fun h => hf (m.eq_of_edist_eq_zero h) }

/-- `WeakEMetricSpace` instance on subsets of emetric spaces -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Defs/Variantaf9bb87cb3dc397f81c06bee09599beeb4fb5d5c1db7824f5dc609383d914101.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Defs/Variantaf9bb87cb3dc397f81c06bee09599beeb4fb5d5c1db7824f5dc609383d914101.lean#L966).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9e1adc511024766f5e38859b9c7daf25e454da0e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
