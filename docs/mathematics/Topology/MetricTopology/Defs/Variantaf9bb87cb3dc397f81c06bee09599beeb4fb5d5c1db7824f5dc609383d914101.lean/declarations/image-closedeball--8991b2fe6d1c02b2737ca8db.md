## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e1699329-24b7-8e69-5ca6-aabbc5625cc7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 762–782.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem image_closedEBall (a : {a // p a}) (r : ℝ≥0∞) :
    Subtype.val '' (closedEBall a r) = closedEBall a.1 r ∩ {a | p a} := by
  rw [← preimage_closedEBall, image_preimage_eq_inter_range, range_val_subtype]

end Subtype

/-- An extended metric space is a type endowed with a `ℝ≥0∞`-valued distance `edist` satisfying
`edist x y = 0 ↔ x = y`, commutativity `edist x y = edist y x`, and the triangle inequality
`edist x z ≤ edist x y + edist y z`.

See pseudo extended metric spaces (`PseudoEMetricSpace`) for the similar class with the
`edist x y = 0 ↔ x = y` assumption weakened to `edist x x = 0`.

Any extended metric space is a T1 topological space and a uniform space (see `TopologicalSpace`,
`T1Space`, `UniformSpace`), where the topology and uniformity come from the metric.

We make the uniformity/topology part of the data instead of deriving it from the metric.
This e.g. ensures that we do not get a diamond when doing
`[EMetricSpace α] [EMetricSpace β] : TopologicalSpace (α × β)`:
The product metric and product topology agree, but not definitionally so.
See Note [forgetful inheritance]. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Defs/Variantaf9bb87cb3dc397f81c06bee09599beeb4fb5d5c1db7824f5dc609383d914101.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Defs/Variantaf9bb87cb3dc397f81c06bee09599beeb4fb5d5c1db7824f5dc609383d914101.lean#L762).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9e1adc511024766f5e38859b9c7daf25e454da0e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
