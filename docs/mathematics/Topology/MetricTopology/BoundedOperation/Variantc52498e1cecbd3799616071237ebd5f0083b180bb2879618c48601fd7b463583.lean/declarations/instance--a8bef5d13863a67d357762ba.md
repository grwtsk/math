## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:adf8638bfc090119914417d3a057cc0d12ac8147f82dc338f2f2a168df465fce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 176–203.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  isBounded_mul {s t} hs ht := by
    obtain ⟨Af, hAf⟩ := (Metric.isBounded_iff_subset_closedBall 0).mp hs
    obtain ⟨Ag, hAg⟩ := (Metric.isBounded_iff_subset_closedBall 0).mp ht
    rw [Metric.isBounded_iff] at hs ht ⊢
    use 2 * Af * Ag
    intro z hz w hw
    obtain ⟨x₁, hx₁, y₁, hy₁, z_eq⟩ := Set.mem_mul.mp hz
    obtain ⟨x₂, hx₂, y₂, hy₂, w_eq⟩ := Set.mem_mul.mp hw
    rw [← w_eq, ← z_eq, dist_eq_norm]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/BoundedOperation/Variantc52498e1cecbd3799616071237ebd5f0083b180bb2879618c48601fd7b463583.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/BoundedOperation/Variantc52498e1cecbd3799616071237ebd5f0083b180bb2879618c48601fd7b463583.lean#L176).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `80c7f008e3460207e09f6b051ddb1bae27de4ffa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
