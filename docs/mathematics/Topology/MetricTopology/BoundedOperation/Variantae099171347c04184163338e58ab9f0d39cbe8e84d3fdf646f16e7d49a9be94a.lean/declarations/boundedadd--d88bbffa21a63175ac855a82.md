## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:71fecf88783a8cb610d2459501c72cf46089543068a119e896bb24ca1d1189e7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class BoundedAdd (R : Type*) [Bornology R] [Add R] : Prop where
  isBounded_add : ∀ {s t : Set R},
    Bornology.IsBounded s → Bornology.IsBounded t → Bornology.IsBounded (s + t)

/-- A typeclass saying that `(p : R × R) ↦ p.1 * p.2` maps any product of bounded sets to a bounded
set. This property automatically holds for non-unital seminormed rings, but it also holds, e.g.,
for `ℝ≥0`. -/
@[to_additive]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/BoundedOperation/Variantae099171347c04184163338e58ab9f0d39cbe8e84d3fdf646f16e7d49a9be94a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/BoundedOperation/Variantae099171347c04184163338e58ab9f0d39cbe8e84d3fdf646f16e7d49a9be94a.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `12a9f5bed44c1ef73672c570df47111091c6ba87` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
