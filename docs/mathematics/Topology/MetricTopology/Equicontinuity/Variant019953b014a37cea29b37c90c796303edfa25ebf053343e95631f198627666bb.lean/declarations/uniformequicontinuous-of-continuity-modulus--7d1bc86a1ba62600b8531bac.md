## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:45f77f14-7f74-1ebe-1883-0271957a61dd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–121.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (b_lim : Tendsto b (𝓝 0) (𝓝 0)) (F : ι → β → α)
    (H : ∀ (x y : β) (i), dist (F i x) (F i y) ≤ b (dist x y)) : UniformEquicontinuous F := by
  rw [Metric.uniformEquicontinuous_iff]

  refine ⟨δ, δ0, fun x y hxy i => ?_⟩
  calc
    dist (F i x) (F i y) ≤ b (dist x y) := H x y i
    _ ≤ |b (dist x y)| := le_abs_self _
    _ = dist (b (dist x y)) 0 := by simp [Real.dist_eq]
    _ < ε := hδ (by simpa only [Real.dist_eq, tsub_zero, abs_dist] using hxy)

/-- For a family of functions between (pseudo) metric spaces, a convenient way to prove
equicontinuity is to show that all of the functions share a common *global* continuity modulus. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Equicontinuity/Variant019953b014a37cea29b37c90c796303edfa25ebf053343e95631f198627666bb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Equicontinuity/Variant019953b014a37cea29b37c90c796303edfa25ebf053343e95631f198627666bb.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0936f3f17fb9557bfdd18945518c4345f1794133` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
