## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:87f9cae8-40c1-db50-0eb8-21be9c7344dd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 126–140.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem VanishingDiam.dist_lt (hA : VanishingDiam A) (ε : ℝ) (ε_pos : 0 < ε) (x : ℕ → β) :
    ∃ n : ℕ, ∀ (y) (_ : y ∈ A (res x n)) (z) (_ : z ∈ A (res x n)), dist y z < ε := by
  specialize hA x
  rw [ENNReal.tendsto_atTop_zero] at hA
  obtain ⟨n, hn⟩ := hA (ENNReal.ofReal (ε / 2)) (by
    simp only [gt_iff_lt, ENNReal.ofReal_pos]; linarith)
  use n
  intro y hy z hz
  rw [← ENNReal.ofReal_lt_ofReal_iff ε_pos, ← edist_dist]
  apply lt_of_le_of_lt (EMetric.edist_le_diam_of_mem hy hz)
  apply lt_of_le_of_lt (hn _ (le_refl _))
  rw [ENNReal.ofReal_lt_ofReal_iff ε_pos]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/CantorScheme/Variantcf2762ea27d6915ebce9b591a1922ab5aa566fa82c13bd18bb22c99570127e98.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/CantorScheme/Variantcf2762ea27d6915ebce9b591a1922ab5aa566fa82c13bd18bb22c99570127e98.lean#L126).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d0623de93499838c49ac0a8971fffd382e418f2a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
