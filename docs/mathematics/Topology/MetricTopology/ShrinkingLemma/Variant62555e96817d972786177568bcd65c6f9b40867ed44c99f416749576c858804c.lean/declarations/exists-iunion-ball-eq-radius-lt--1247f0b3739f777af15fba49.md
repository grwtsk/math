## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2e4a5ef6-e265-1c2c-1c85-3779a502866d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 61–69.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_iUnion_ball_eq_radius_lt {r : ι → ℝ} (uf : ∀ x, { i | x ∈ ball (c i) (r i) }.Finite)
    (uU : ⋃ i, ball (c i) (r i) = univ) :
    ∃ r' : ι → ℝ, ⋃ i, ball (c i) (r' i) = univ ∧ ∀ i, r' i < r i :=
  let ⟨r', hU, hv⟩ := exists_subset_iUnion_ball_radius_lt isClosed_univ (fun x _ => uf x) uU.ge
  ⟨r', univ_subset_iff.1 hU, hv⟩

/-- Shrinking lemma for coverings by open balls in a proper metric space. A point-finite open cover
of a closed subset of a proper metric space by nonempty open balls can be shrunk to a new cover by
nonempty open balls so that each of the new balls has strictly smaller radius than the old one. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/ShrinkingLemma/Variant62555e96817d972786177568bcd65c6f9b40867ed44c99f416749576c858804c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/ShrinkingLemma/Variant62555e96817d972786177568bcd65c6f9b40867ed44c99f416749576c858804c.lean#L61).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d095ba3f46499c643cfaa5a8d83b927ed4f8a868` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
