## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bee70b6b-3ce5-cf1b-6a3c-fe59e951d82a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 603–706.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem exists_lipschitz_retraction_of_isClosed {s : Set (∀ n, E n)} (hs : IsClosed s)
    (hne : s.Nonempty) :
    ∃ f : (∀ n, E n) → ∀ n, E n, (∀ x ∈ s, f x = x) ∧ range f = s ∧ LipschitzWith 1 f := by
  /- The map `f` is defined as follows. For `x ∈ s`, let `f x = x`. Otherwise, consider the longest
    prefix `w` that `x` shares with an element of `s`, and let `f x = z_w` where `z_w` is an element
    of `s` starting with `w`. All the desired properties are clear, except the fact that `f` is
    `1`-Lipschitz: if two points `x, y` belong to a common cylinder of length `n`, one should show
    that their images also belong to a common cylinder of length `n`. This is a case analysis:
    * if both `x, y ∈ s`, then this is clear.
    * if `x ∈ s` but `y ∉ s`, then the longest prefix `w` of `y` shared by an element of `s` is of
    length at least `n` (because of `x`), and then `f y` starts with `w` and therefore stays in the
    same length `n` cylinder.
    * if `x ∉ s`, `y ∉ s`, let `w` be the longest prefix of `x` shared by an element of `s`. If its
    length is `< n`, then it is also the longest prefix of `y`, and we get `f x = f y = z_w`.
    Otherwise, `f x` remains in the same `n`-cylinder as `x`. Similarly for `y`. Finally, `f x` and
    `f y` are again in the same `n`-cylinder, as desired. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/PiNat/Variant7adec7f148e44d50a48774864e55a7b64f34de1dcada1071374736c038fab04d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.
