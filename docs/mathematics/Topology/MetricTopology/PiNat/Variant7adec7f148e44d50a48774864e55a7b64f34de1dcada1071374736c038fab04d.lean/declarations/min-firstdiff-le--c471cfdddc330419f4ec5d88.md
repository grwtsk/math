## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:12aa5a19-4518-be5c-b6d3-350b539e4419`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 99–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem min_firstDiff_le (x y z : ∀ n, E n) (h : x ≠ z) :
    min (firstDiff x y) (firstDiff y z) ≤ firstDiff x z := by
  by_contra' H
  rw [lt_min_iff] at H
  refine apply_firstDiff_ne h ?_
  calc
    x (firstDiff x z) = y (firstDiff x z) := apply_eq_of_lt_firstDiff H.1
    _ = z (firstDiff x z) := apply_eq_of_lt_firstDiff H.2
#align pi_nat.min_first_diff_le PiNat.min_firstDiff_le

/-! ### Cylinders -/

/-- In a product space `Π n, E n`, the cylinder set of length `n` around `x`, denoted
`cylinder x n`, is the set of sequences `y` that coincide with `x` on the first `n` symbols, i.e.,
such that `y i = x i` for all `i < n`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/PiNat/Variant7adec7f148e44d50a48774864e55a7b64f34de1dcada1071374736c038fab04d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/PiNat/Variant7adec7f148e44d50a48774864e55a7b64f34de1dcada1071374736c038fab04d.lean#L99).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ec4e50ee38c606a26670c8224108b37944880ea0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
