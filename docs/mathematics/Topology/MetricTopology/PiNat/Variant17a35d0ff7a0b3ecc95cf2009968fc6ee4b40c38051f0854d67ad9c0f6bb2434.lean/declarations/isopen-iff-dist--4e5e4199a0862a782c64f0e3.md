## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:698433cb-ebbc-17af-8a00-bd51a525a4ca`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 390–415.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Metric space structure on `Π (n : ℕ), E n` when the spaces `E n` have the discrete topology,
where the distance is given by `dist x y = (1/2)^n`, where `n` is the smallest index where `x` and
`y` differ. Not registered as a global instance by default.
Warning: this definition makes sure that the topology is defeq to the original product topology,
but it does not take care of a possible uniformity. If the `E n` have a uniform structure, then
there will be two non-defeq uniform structures on `Π n, E n`, the product one and the one coming
from the metric structure. In this case, use `metricSpaceOfDiscreteUniformity` instead. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/PiNat/Variant17a35d0ff7a0b3ecc95cf2009968fc6ee4b40c38051f0854d67ad9c0f6bb2434.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/PiNat/Variant17a35d0ff7a0b3ecc95cf2009968fc6ee4b40c38051f0854d67ad9c0f6bb2434.lean#L390).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ca3bd8d91265aeffa42571b7fef04cad045745bb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
