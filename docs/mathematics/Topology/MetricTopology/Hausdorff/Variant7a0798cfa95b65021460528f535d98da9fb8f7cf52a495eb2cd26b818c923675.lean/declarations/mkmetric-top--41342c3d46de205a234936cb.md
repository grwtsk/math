## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9c84088b-ed88-8580-d978-a9ef30be18d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 366–374.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mkMetric_top : (mkMetric (fun _ => ∞ : ℝ≥0∞ → ℝ≥0∞) : OuterMeasure X) = ⊤ := by
  simp_rw [mkMetric, mkMetric', mkMetric'.pre, extend_top, boundedBy_top, eq_top_iff]
  rw [le_iSup_iff]
  intro b hb
  simpa using hb ⊤
#align measure_theory.outer_measure.mk_metric_top MeasureTheory.OuterMeasure.mkMetric_top

/-- If `m₁ d ≤ m₂ d` for `d < ε` for some `ε > 0` (we use `≤ᶠ[𝓝[≥] 0]` to state this), then
`mkMetric m₁ hm₁ ≤ mkMetric m₂ hm₂`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Hausdorff/Variant7a0798cfa95b65021460528f535d98da9fb8f7cf52a495eb2cd26b818c923675.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Hausdorff/Variant7a0798cfa95b65021460528f535d98da9fb8f7cf52a495eb2cd26b818c923675.lean#L366).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `53256e89e379be77f46fd241327ac4308c66161e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
