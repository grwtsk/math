## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:aaa4138887ab21ea8df248f7f20ec4a3800087add585eaef0072a67567937503`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 416–421.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkMetric' (m : Set X → ℝ≥0∞) : Measure X :=
  (OuterMeasure.mkMetric' m).toMeasure (OuterMeasure.mkMetric'_isMetric _).le_caratheodory

/-- Given a function `m : ℝ≥0∞ → ℝ≥0∞`, `mkMetric m` is the supremum of `μ r` over `r > 0`, where
`μ r` is the maximal outer measure `μ` such that `μ s ≤ m s` for all sets `s` that contain at least
two points. While each `mkMetric'.pre` is an *outer* measure, the supremum is a measure. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Hausdorff/Variant3ce273d5597a7666795faab78b0e3735d66c00c3089d7cebe755c34794001f3d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Hausdorff/Variant3ce273d5597a7666795faab78b0e3735d66c00c3089d7cebe755c34794001f3d.lean#L416).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c79bc8875aa7428d749bfc0e3cf2684bcee37b92` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
