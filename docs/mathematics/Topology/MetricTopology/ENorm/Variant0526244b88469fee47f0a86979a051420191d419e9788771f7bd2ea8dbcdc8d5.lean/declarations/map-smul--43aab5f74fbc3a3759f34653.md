## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:099f3591-afee-b5be-3cac-44959a5c2de9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  apply le_antisymm (e.map_smul_le' c x)

    (‖c‖₊ : ℝ≥0∞) * e x = ‖c‖₊ * e (c⁻¹ • c • x) := by rw [inv_smul_smul₀ hc]
    _ ≤ ‖c‖₊ * (‖c⁻¹‖₊ * e (c • x)) := mul_le_mul_left' (e.map_smul_le' _ _) _
    _ = e (c • x) := by
      rw [← mul_assoc, nnnorm_inv, ENNReal.coe_inv, ENNReal.mul_inv_cancel _ ENNReal.coe_ne_top,
        one_mul]
        <;> simp [hc]
#align enorm.map_smul ENorm.map_smul

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/ENorm/Variant0526244b88469fee47f0a86979a051420191d419e9788771f7bd2ea8dbcdc8d5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/ENorm/Variant0526244b88469fee47f0a86979a051420191d419e9788771f7bd2ea8dbcdc8d5.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6192915b9c0861be6168f6397300ca082fda6be9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
