## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8314d7a1-e4c7-429c-1d6a-83762ad45ef6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 527–536.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma nnnorm_cfc_nnreal_lt {f : ℝ≥0 → ℝ≥0} {a : A} {c : ℝ≥0} (hc : 0 < c)
    (h : ∀ x ∈ σ ℝ≥0 a, f x < c) : ‖cfc f a‖₊ < c := by
  obtain (_ | _) := subsingleton_or_nontrivial A

  · refine cfc_cases (‖·‖₊ < c) a f (by simpa) fun hf ha ↦ ?_
    simp only [← cfc_apply f a, (IsGreatest.nnnorm_cfc_nnreal f a hf ha |>.lt_iff)]
    rintro - ⟨x, hx, rfl⟩
    exact h x hx

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Isometric/Variantc288709583712c4902d8919ff095e48193db3a48b9bf967900981c1dc3361308.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Isometric/Variantc288709583712c4902d8919ff095e48193db3a48b9bf967900981c1dc3361308.lean#L527).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c35f564d08a1a5b5c451abb6269f27c4175ae33e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
