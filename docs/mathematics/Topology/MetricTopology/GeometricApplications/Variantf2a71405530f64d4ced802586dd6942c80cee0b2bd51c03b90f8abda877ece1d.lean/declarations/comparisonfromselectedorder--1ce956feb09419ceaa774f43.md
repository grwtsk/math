## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:995db142367e278747e8170bce41ea90d9dff60f3810a500f82c6b0a25966caa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 243–253.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def comparisonFromSelectedOrder
    {T : SmoothFramedSurgeryTheory}
    {G : RelativeBoundaryDiffeomorphismTheory T}
    {M : T.Manifold} {count : Nat}
    (topology : RicciNeckSurgeryTopology T G M count)
    (order : Equiv.Perm (Fin count)) :
    G.Hom topology.preDeletionManifold
      (topology.coherentExecution.execution order).result :=
  topology.coherentExecution.comparison topology.selectedOrder order

/-- The selected result is relatively diffeomorphic to every other typed order result. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/GeometricApplications/Variantf2a71405530f64d4ced802586dd6942c80cee0b2bd51c03b90f8abda877ece1d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/GeometricApplications/Variantf2a71405530f64d4ced802586dd6942c80cee0b2bd51c03b90f8abda877ece1d.lean#L243).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3029a94bb57199032f687505b76b628a053abf58` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
