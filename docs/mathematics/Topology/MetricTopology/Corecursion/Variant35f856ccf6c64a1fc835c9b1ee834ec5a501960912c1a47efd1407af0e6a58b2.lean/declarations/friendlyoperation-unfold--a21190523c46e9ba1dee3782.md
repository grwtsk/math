## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b54ce60d15de270b46af711cda4caba449bedbdd50f5da33fb9c79a778d76573`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 355–374.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def FriendlyOperation.unfold {op : Seq α → Seq α} (h : FriendlyOperation op) (hd? : Option α) :
    Option (α × Subtype (@FriendlyOperation α)) :=
  match hd? with
  | none =>
    match (op nil).destruct with
    | none => none
    | some (t_hd, t_tl) =>
      some (t_hd, ⟨fun _ ↦ t_tl, FriendlyOperation.const⟩)
  | some s_hd =>
    match (op <| .cons s_hd nil).destruct with
    | none => none
    | some (t_hd, _) =>
      some (t_hd, ⟨fun s_tl ↦ (op (.cons s_hd s_tl)).tail, FriendlyOperation.cons_tail h⟩)

/-- `unfold` correctly decomposes a friendly operation: the head of `op s` depends only on the
head of `s` (and is given by `unfold`), while the tail of `op s` is obtained by applying the
friendly operation returned by `unfold` to the tail of `s`. This gives a coinductive
characterization of `FriendlyOperation`. For the coinduction principle, see
`FriendlyOperation.coind`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Corecursion/Variant35f856ccf6c64a1fc835c9b1ee834ec5a501960912c1a47efd1407af0e6a58b2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Corecursion/Variant35f856ccf6c64a1fc835c9b1ee834ec5a501960912c1a47efd1407af0e6a58b2.lean#L355).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `69e9b0ead301879ca23c34e52f2563846de24be0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
