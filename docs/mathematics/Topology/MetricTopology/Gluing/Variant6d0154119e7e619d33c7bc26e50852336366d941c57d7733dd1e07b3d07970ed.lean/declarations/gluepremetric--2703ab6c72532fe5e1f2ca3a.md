## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:93169395d542b33e5e19e9079e0d7c5b75ed6f48b86c10f815f1ef81c675feee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 469–476.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def gluePremetric (hΦ : Isometry Φ) (hΨ : Isometry Ψ) : PseudoMetricSpace (X ⊕ Y) where
  dist := glueDist Φ Ψ 0
  dist_self := glueDist_self Φ Ψ 0
  dist_comm := glueDist_comm Φ Ψ 0
  dist_triangle := glueDist_triangle Φ Ψ 0 fun p q => by rw [hΦ.dist_eq, hΨ.dist_eq]; simp

/-- Given two isometric embeddings `Φ : Z → X` and `Ψ : Z → Y`, we define a
space `GlueSpace hΦ hΨ` by identifying in `X ⊕ Y` the points `Φ x` and `Ψ x`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Gluing/Variant6d0154119e7e619d33c7bc26e50852336366d941c57d7733dd1e07b3d07970ed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Gluing/Variant6d0154119e7e619d33c7bc26e50852336366d941c57d7733dd1e07b3d07970ed.lean#L469).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `56f47c2b3bdd78f64a8420da4032be837ee8333e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
