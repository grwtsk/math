## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:09d43166-f665-7216-de44-8020cec625d7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–170.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem eq_of_glueDist_eq_zero (Φ : Z → X) (Ψ : Z → Y) (ε : ℝ) (ε0 : 0 < ε) :
    ∀ p q : Sum X Y, glueDist Φ Ψ ε p q = 0 → p = q
  | .inl x, .inl y, h => by rw [eq_of_dist_eq_zero h]
  | .inl x, .inr y, h => by exfalso; linarith [le_glueDist_inl_inr Φ Ψ ε x y]
  | .inr x, .inl y, h => by exfalso; linarith [le_glueDist_inr_inl Φ Ψ ε x y]
  | .inr x, .inr y, h => by rw [eq_of_dist_eq_zero h]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Gluing/Variant27e1a16cb050d0aee4e7ba2b3a047dc7d0f397a44d1b824a918b99bfc1430548.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Gluing/Variant27e1a16cb050d0aee4e7ba2b3a047dc7d0f397a44d1b824a918b99bfc1430548.lean#L164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `54501b4a3f433841b2097d29528171bef0baef85` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
