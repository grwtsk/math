## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:762bf52d-0089-51e4-dc1d-2343103b761e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 538–568.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Inductive limit of metric spaces

In this section, we define the inductive limit of

```
     f 0        f 1        f 2        f 3
X 0 -----> X 1 -----> X 2 -----> X 3 -----> ...
```

where the `X n` are metric spaces and f n isometric embeddings. We do it by defining a premetric
space structure on `Σ n, X n`, where the predistance `dist x y` is obtained by pushing `x` and `y`
in a common `X k` using composition by the `f n`, and taking the distance there. This does not
depend on the choice of `k` as the `f n` are isometries. The metric space associated to this
premetric space is the desired inductive limit.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Gluing/Variant1a2e4eec3f77d7817a4be9107ea27d514c8f41d5ea8d3278bcd6e1c9fb9085bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Gluing/Variant1a2e4eec3f77d7817a4be9107ea27d514c8f41d5ea8d3278bcd6e1c9fb9085bd.lean#L538).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cdd1497f199806dccef8b9d3c17022aa1b1a9d72` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
