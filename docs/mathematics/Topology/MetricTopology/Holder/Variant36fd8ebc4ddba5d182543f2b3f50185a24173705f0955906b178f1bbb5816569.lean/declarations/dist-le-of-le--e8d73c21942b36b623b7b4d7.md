## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:043153bd-1d73-77f1-bdf5-2b5d98288fa1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 259–266.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dist_le_of_le (hf : HolderWith C r f) {x y : X} {d : ℝ} (hd : dist x y ≤ d) :
    dist (f x) (f y) ≤ C * d ^ (r : ℝ) := by
  lift d to ℝ≥0 using dist_nonneg.trans hd

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Holder/Variant36fd8ebc4ddba5d182543f2b3f50185a24173705f0955906b178f1bbb5816569.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Holder/Variant36fd8ebc4ddba5d182543f2b3f50185a24173705f0955906b178f1bbb5816569.lean#L259).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f1c185c26b8e8d9ab5a40110cda9a36909eed6ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
