## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:752592fe-71d8-b382-b358-1b88275b69d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–100.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
lemma bornology_eq_of_bilipschitz (hf₁ : AntilipschitzWith K₁ f) (hf₂ : LipschitzWith K₂ f) :
    @cobounded _ (induced f) = cobounded α :=
  le_antisymm hf₂.comap_cobounded_le hf₁.tendsto_cobounded.le_comap


/-- If `f : α → β` is bilipschitz, then the pullback of the bornology on `β` through `f` agrees
with the bornology on `α`.

This can be used to provide the replacement equality when applying
`PseudoMetricSpace.replaceBornology`, which can be useful when following the forgetful inheritance
pattern when creating type synonyms.

Important Note: if `α` is some synonym of a type `β` (at default transparency), and `f : α ≃ β` is
some bilipschitz equivalence, then instead of writing:
```
instance : Bornology α := inferInstanceAs (Bornology β)
```
Users should instead write something like:
```
instance : Bornology α := Bornology.induced (f : α → β)
```
in order to avoid abuse of the definitional equality `α := β`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Bilipschitz/Variant45763aa96862294de1d4783ada851007e16d9c1b39350f6c37634bd60c86ef71.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Bilipschitz/Variant45763aa96862294de1d4783ada851007e16d9c1b39350f6c37634bd60c86ef71.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e2fc88f43d20b68098907838afb2dff0cf2018de` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
