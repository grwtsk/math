## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:715bcd0b-2e45-a5f3-9e1e-e3a08c933703`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 349–357.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma dist_orthogonalProjection_eq_infNndist (s : AffineSubspace ℝ P) [Nonempty s]
    [s.direction.HasOrthogonalProjection] (p : P) :
    nndist p (orthogonalProjection s p) = Metric.infNndist p s := by
  rw [← NNReal.coe_inj]
  simp [dist_orthogonalProjection_eq_infDist]

/-- The square of the distance between two points constructed by
adding multiples of the same orthogonal vector to points in the same
subspace. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Projection/Variantfa31d1d82c7b31b0541ac04628d04ad886f4f7f59fcccc5771d62872711c080a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Projection/Variantfa31d1d82c7b31b0541ac04628d04ad886f4f7f59fcccc5771d62872711c080a.lean#L349).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cd85e240c46743b65059b0945464e0510d11201a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
