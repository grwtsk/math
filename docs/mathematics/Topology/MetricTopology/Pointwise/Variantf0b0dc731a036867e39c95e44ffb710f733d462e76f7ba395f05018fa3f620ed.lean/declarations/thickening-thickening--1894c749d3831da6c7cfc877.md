## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d2f61cd1-21e5-d1f5-d667-2c116eb78f52`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 274–284.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem thickening_thickening (hε : 0 < ε) (hδ : 0 < δ) (s : Set E) :
    thickening ε (thickening δ s) = thickening (ε + δ) s :=

    simp_rw [mem_thickening_iff]
    rintro ⟨z, hz, hxz⟩
    rw [add_comm] at hxz
    obtain ⟨y, hxy, hyz⟩ := exists_dist_lt_lt hε hδ hxz
    exact ⟨y, ⟨_, hz, hyz⟩, hxy⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Pointwise/Variantf0b0dc731a036867e39c95e44ffb710f733d462e76f7ba395f05018fa3f620ed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Pointwise/Variantf0b0dc731a036867e39c95e44ffb710f733d462e76f7ba395f05018fa3f620ed.lean#L274).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8d5475f5b8aa812720c499ff5b0479122ce5f9ed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
