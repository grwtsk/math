## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eea5ecf5-60a5-d18c-d03d-c6de55ca2d57`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 85–90.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem smul_ball {c : 𝕜} (hc : c ≠ 0) (x : E) (r : ℝ) : c • ball x r = ball (c • x) (‖c‖ * r) := by
  ext y
  rw [mem_smul_set_iff_inv_smul_mem₀ hc]
  conv_lhs => rw [← inv_smul_smul₀ hc x]
  simp [← div_eq_inv_mul, div_lt_iff₀ (norm_pos_iff.2 hc), mul_comm _ r, dist_smul₀]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Pointwise/Variantc3ecd09f2edc2f08d21aad97df306a3cd9286e753e87a64ea923eff2c528e7b3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Pointwise/Variantc3ecd09f2edc2f08d21aad97df306a3cd9286e753e87a64ea923eff2c528e7b3.lean#L85).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e64bf1cbb27bf509b67efb78dcc67513a933188e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
