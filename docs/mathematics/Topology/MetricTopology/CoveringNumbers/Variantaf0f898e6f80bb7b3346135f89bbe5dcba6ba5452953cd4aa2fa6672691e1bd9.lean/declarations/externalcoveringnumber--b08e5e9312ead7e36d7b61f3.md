## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:015adc9bff729c99b592833627ec28eaebce0accab0074093dbd953aca5f3e2b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–84.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def externalCoveringNumber (ε : ℝ≥0) (A : Set X) : ℕ∞ :=
  ⨅ (C : Set X) (_ : IsCover ε A C), C.encard

/-- The covering number (or internal covering number) of a set `A` for radius `ε` is
the minimal cardinality (in `ℕ∞`) of an `ε`-cover contained in `A`. -/
noncomputable
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/CoveringNumbers/Variantaf0f898e6f80bb7b3346135f89bbe5dcba6ba5452953cd4aa2fa6672691e1bd9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/CoveringNumbers/Variantaf0f898e6f80bb7b3346135f89bbe5dcba6ba5452953cd4aa2fa6672691e1bd9.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `75163648232b773ef5f67fb1669306b0ae191812` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
