## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6c5c2396-a1cb-4729-35ab-085c2192eabf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 130–134.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem le_einfsep_pair : edist x y ⊓ edist y x ≤ ({x, y} : Set α).einfsep := by
  simp_rw [le_einfsep_iff, inf_le_iff, mem_insert_iff, mem_singleton_iff]
  rintro a (rfl | rfl) b (rfl | rfl) hab <;> (try simp only [le_refl, true_or, or_true]) <;>
    contradiction

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Infsep/Variant06d1b5914b3ea19c2c8905e6d06c5eb4b947f5885abcf62a8f0d5c02ceb0ebb5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Infsep/Variant06d1b5914b3ea19c2c8905e6d06c5eb4b947f5885abcf62a8f0d5c02ceb0ebb5.lean#L130).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `552efd3e7ff0867c76f9ca635cfb869880c78112` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
