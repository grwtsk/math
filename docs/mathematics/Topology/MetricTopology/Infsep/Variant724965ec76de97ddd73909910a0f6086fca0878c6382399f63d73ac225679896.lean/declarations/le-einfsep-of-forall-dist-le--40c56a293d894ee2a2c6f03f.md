## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:78716e89-75f2-48a0-69c4-2b5e4119b299`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 242–251.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem le_einfsep_of_forall_dist_le {d} (h : ∀ x ∈ s, ∀ y ∈ s, x ≠ y → d ≤ dist x y) :
    ENNReal.ofReal d ≤ s.einfsep :=
  le_einfsep fun x hx y hy hxy => (edist_dist x y).symm ▸ ENNReal.ofReal_le_ofReal (h x hx y hy hxy)

end PseudoMetricSpace

section EMetricSpace

variable [EMetricSpace α] {s : Set α}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Infsep/Variant724965ec76de97ddd73909910a0f6086fca0878c6382399f63d73ac225679896.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Infsep/Variant724965ec76de97ddd73909910a0f6086fca0878c6382399f63d73ac225679896.lean#L242).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `401781108a07303b7c65d234ccf372427d0c1114` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
