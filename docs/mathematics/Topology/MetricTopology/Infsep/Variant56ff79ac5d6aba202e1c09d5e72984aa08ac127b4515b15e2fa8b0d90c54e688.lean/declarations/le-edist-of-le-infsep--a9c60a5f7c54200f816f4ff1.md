## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:10ce5afa-9101-9a91-c518-87198cc3fafa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 421–429.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem le_edist_of_le_infsep {d x} (hx : x ∈ s) {y} (hy : y ∈ s) (hxy : x ≠ y)
    (hd : d ≤ s.infsep) : d ≤ dist x y := by
  by_cases hs : s.Nontrivial
  · exact hs.le_infsep_iff.1 hd x hx y hy hxy
  · rw [not_nontrivial_iff] at hs
    rw [hs.infsep_zero] at hd
    exact le_trans hd dist_nonneg
#align set.le_edist_of_le_infsep Set.le_edist_of_le_infsep

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Infsep/Variant56ff79ac5d6aba202e1c09d5e72984aa08ac127b4515b15e2fa8b0d90c54e688.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Infsep/Variant56ff79ac5d6aba202e1c09d5e72984aa08ac127b4515b15e2fa8b0d90c54e688.lean#L421).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5ded06d8a961e71b879c1c49853bcb9d828a18c9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
