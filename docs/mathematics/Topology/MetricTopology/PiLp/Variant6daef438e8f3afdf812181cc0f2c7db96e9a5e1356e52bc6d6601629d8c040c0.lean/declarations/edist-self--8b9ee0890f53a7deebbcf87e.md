## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0aaad389-4e5c-8f10-7ce7-6ee35f301c56`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 171–179.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem edist_self (f : PiLp p β) : edist f f = 0 := by
  rcases p.trichotomy with (rfl | rfl | h)
  · simp [edist_eq_card]
  · simp [edist_eq_iSup]
  · simp [edist_eq_sum h, ENNReal.zero_rpow_of_pos h, ENNReal.zero_rpow_of_pos (inv_pos.2 <| h)]
#align pi_Lp.edist_self PiLp.edist_self

/-- This holds independent of `p` and does not require `[Fact (1 ≤ p)]`. We keep it separate
from `pi_Lp.pseudo_emetric_space` so it can be used also for `p < 1`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/PiLp/Variant6daef438e8f3afdf812181cc0f2c7db96e9a5e1356e52bc6d6601629d8c040c0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/PiLp/Variant6daef438e8f3afdf812181cc0f2c7db96e9a5e1356e52bc6d6601629d8c040c0.lean#L171).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0c107415cf7cea70f9788cccb8e7a2f52584748a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
