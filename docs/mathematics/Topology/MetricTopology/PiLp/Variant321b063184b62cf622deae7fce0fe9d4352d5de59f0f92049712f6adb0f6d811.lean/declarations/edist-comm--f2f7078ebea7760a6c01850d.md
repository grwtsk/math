## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a86502af-f151-2ef0-9a9d-ad2a3fce61e8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 206–224.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem edist_comm (f g : PiLp p β) : edist f g = edist g f := by
  rcases p.trichotomy with (rfl | rfl | h)
  · simp only [edist_eq_card, edist_comm]
  · simp only [edist_eq_iSup, edist_comm]
  · simp only [edist_eq_sum h, edist_comm]

end EdistProp

section Dist

variable [∀ i, Dist (α i)]

/-- Endowing the space `PiLp p β` with the `L^p` distance. We register this instance
separate from `pi_Lp.pseudo_metric` since the latter requires the type class hypothesis
`[Fact (1 ≤ p)]` in order to prove the triangle inequality.

Registering this separately allows for a future metric-like structure on `PiLp p β` for `p < 1`
satisfying a relaxed triangle inequality. The terminology for this varies throughout the
literature, but it is sometimes called a *quasi-metric* or *semi-metric*. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/PiLp/Variant321b063184b62cf622deae7fce0fe9d4352d5de59f0f92049712f6adb0f6d811.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/PiLp/Variant321b063184b62cf622deae7fce0fe9d4352d5de59f0f92049712f6adb0f6d811.lean#L206).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a3b0dbc4ef24118b6e84bb3063adf08f7cab9d2e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
