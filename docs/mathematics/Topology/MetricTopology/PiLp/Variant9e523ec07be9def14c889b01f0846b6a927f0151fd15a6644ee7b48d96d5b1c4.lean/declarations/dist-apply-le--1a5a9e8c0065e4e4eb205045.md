## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0afaab39-1f56-0152-abb6-588cb8d20143`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 660–665.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dist_apply_le [∀ i, PseudoMetricSpace (β i)] (x y : PiLp p β) (i : ι) :
    dist (x i) (y i) ≤ dist x y :=
  nndist_apply_le x y i

end

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/PiLp/Variant9e523ec07be9def14c889b01f0846b6a927f0151fd15a6644ee7b48d96d5b1c4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/PiLp/Variant9e523ec07be9def14c889b01f0846b6a927f0151fd15a6644ee7b48d96d5b1c4.lean#L660).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d42dadc5111b1ba499ffed8b1946d5ec64cf1994` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
