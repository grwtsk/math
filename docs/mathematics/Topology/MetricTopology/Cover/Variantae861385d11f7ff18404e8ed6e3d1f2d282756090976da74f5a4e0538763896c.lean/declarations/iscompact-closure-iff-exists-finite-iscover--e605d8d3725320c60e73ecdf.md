## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3c2c7438-17a5-0eb7-4697-7cb017da1d80`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 188–194.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isCompact_closure_iff_exists_finite_isCover (hε : ε ≠ 0) :
    IsCompact (closure s) ↔ ∃ N ⊆ s, N.Finite ∧ IsCover ε s N where
  mp := exists_finite_isCover_of_isCompact_closure hε
  mpr := fun ⟨_N, _, hN, hsN⟩ ↦ hsN.isCompact_closure hN.isCompact

end MetricSpace
end Metric
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Cover/Variantae861385d11f7ff18404e8ed6e3d1f2d282756090976da74f5a4e0538763896c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Cover/Variantae861385d11f7ff18404e8ed6e3d1f2d282756090976da74f5a4e0538763896c.lean#L188).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d58a3e02907c76b9b983ee95f9031a4a410cd704` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
