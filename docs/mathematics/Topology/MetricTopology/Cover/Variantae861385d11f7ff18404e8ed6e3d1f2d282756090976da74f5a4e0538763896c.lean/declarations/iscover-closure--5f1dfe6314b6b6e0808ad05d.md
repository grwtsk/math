## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:819e9386-7b8e-c582-d7cf-f53533510fcd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 158–167.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma isCover_closure (hN : IsClosed N) : IsCover ε (closure s) N ↔ IsCover ε s N := by
  simpa [isCover_iff_subset_cthickening hN] using (isClosed_cthickening (E := N)).closure_subset_iff

protected alias ⟨_, IsCover.closure⟩ := isCover_closure

end PseudoMetricSpace

section EMetricSpace
variable [EMetricSpace X] {ε : ℝ≥0} {s N : Set X}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Cover/Variantae861385d11f7ff18404e8ed6e3d1f2d282756090976da74f5a4e0538763896c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Cover/Variantae861385d11f7ff18404e8ed6e3d1f2d282756090976da74f5a4e0538763896c.lean#L158).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d58a3e02907c76b9b983ee95f9031a4a410cd704` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
