## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cc4d60dc-b3c3-abb3-92e8-14c7604ad971`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 240–250.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma abs_im_eq_norm {z : ℂ} : |z.im| = ‖z‖ ↔ z.re = 0 :=
  not_iff_not.1 <| (abs_im_le_norm z).lt_iff_ne.symm.trans abs_im_lt_norm

@[deprecated (since := "2025-02-16")] alias abs_le_abs_re_add_abs_im := norm_le_abs_re_add_abs_im

@[deprecated (since := "2025-02-16")] alias abs_re_eq_abs := abs_re_eq_norm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Norm/Variant9893b577c8f3a68be5c49888849560247ddae9686c1cc033dcab6a08566fddf0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Norm/Variant9893b577c8f3a68be5c49888849560247ddae9686c1cc033dcab6a08566fddf0.lean#L240).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `de1b5bacb28d32fa8232a593e4b206f97ff07dae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
