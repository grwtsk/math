## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b7ecd6c6ea1c78d4e122091568ef1577ac3167b04168ebdf901c6ebf376856bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 486–495.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance compactSpace_optimalGHCoupling : CompactSpace (OptimalGHCoupling X Y) := ⟨by
  rw [← range_quotient_mk']
  exact isCompact_range (continuous_sum_dom.2
    ⟨(isometry_optimalGHInjl X Y).continuous, (isometry_optimalGHInjr X Y).continuous⟩)⟩
#align Gromov_Hausdorff.compact_space_optimal_GH_coupling GromovHausdorff.compactSpace_optimalGHCoupling

/-- For any candidate `f`, `HD(f)` is larger than or equal to the Hausdorff distance in the
optimal coupling. This follows from the fact that `HD` of the optimal candidate is exactly
the Hausdorff distance in the optimal coupling, although we only prove here the inequality
we need. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/GromovHausdorffRealized/Variant4a4c8a4e78eba411165d0662d1590049baa5082b46158b921cb784d054b1b41e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/GromovHausdorffRealized/Variant4a4c8a4e78eba411165d0662d1590049baa5082b46158b921cb784d054b1b41e.lean#L486).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f554c13e90b90b506b2b80187f766c837c76fa45` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
