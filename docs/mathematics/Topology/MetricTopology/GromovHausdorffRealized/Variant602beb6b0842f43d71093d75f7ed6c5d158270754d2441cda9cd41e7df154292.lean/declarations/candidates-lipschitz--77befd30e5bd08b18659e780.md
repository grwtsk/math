## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:16ee647a-fec4-afeb-d739-d94e404873e9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 197–207.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem candidates_lipschitz (fA : f ∈ candidates X Y) :
    LipschitzWith (2 * maxVar X Y) f := by
  apply LipschitzWith.of_dist_le_mul
  rintro ⟨x, y⟩ ⟨z, t⟩
  rw [Real.dist_eq, abs_sub_le_iff]
  use candidates_lipschitz_aux fA
  rw [dist_comm]
  exact candidates_lipschitz_aux fA

/-- To apply Arzela-Ascoli, we need to check that the set of candidates is closed and
equicontinuous. Equicontinuity follows from the Lipschitz control, we check closedness. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/GromovHausdorffRealized/Variant602beb6b0842f43d71093d75f7ed6c5d158270754d2441cda9cd41e7df154292.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/GromovHausdorffRealized/Variant602beb6b0842f43d71093d75f7ed6c5d158270754d2441cda9cd41e7df154292.lean#L197).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `67f72d8b0c77b568d35ae990958bc3d1839de598` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
