## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6c6532ab-4eae-cafb-dc23-4401288816f7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 356–383.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

private theorem HD_lipschitz_aux1 (f g : Cb X Y) :
    (⨆ x, ⨅ y, f (inl x, inr y)) ≤ (⨆ x, ⨅ y, g (inl x, inr y)) + dist f g := by
  rcases (Real.bounded_iff_bddBelow_bddAbove.1 g.bounded_range).1 with ⟨cg, hcg⟩
  have Hcg : ∀ x, cg ≤ g x := fun x => hcg (mem_range_self x)
  rcases (Real.bounded_iff_bddBelow_bddAbove.1 f.bounded_range).1 with ⟨cf, hcf⟩
  have Hcf : ∀ x, cf ≤ f x := fun x => hcf (mem_range_self x)
  -- prove the inequality but with `dist f g` inside, by using inequalities comparing
  -- iSup to iSup and iInf to iInf

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/GromovHausdorffRealized/Variant4e77d1e66d007eb510613800223a8b48eefc43c4e8296b3037cc71742ddff889.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/GromovHausdorffRealized/Variant4e77d1e66d007eb510613800223a8b48eefc43c4e8296b3037cc71742ddff889.lean#L356).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
