## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a06440bb-7887-8798-2865-18320e0f4216`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 177–181.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem efixedPoint_mem' {s : Set α} (hsc : IsComplete s) (hsf : MapsTo f s s)
    (hf : ContractingWith K <| hsf.restrict f s s) {x : α} (hxs : x ∈ s) (hx : edist x (f x) ≠ ∞) :
    efixedPoint' f hsc hsf hf x hxs hx ∈ s :=
  (Classical.choose_spec <| hf.exists_fixedPoint' hsc hsf hxs hx).1

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Contracting/Variant8d567fac6fdd9223c975598f79080ca011a5651a2dcc6c78472644fee424c3cb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Contracting/Variant8d567fac6fdd9223c975598f79080ca011a5651a2dcc6c78472644fee424c3cb.lean#L177).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `06fbb34930ba5071bfda1dbe4ad79edcaa6229f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
