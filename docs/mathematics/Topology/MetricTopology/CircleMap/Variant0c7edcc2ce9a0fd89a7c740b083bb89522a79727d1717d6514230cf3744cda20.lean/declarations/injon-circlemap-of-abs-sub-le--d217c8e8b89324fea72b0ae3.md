## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:602fbfac-60b3-1849-81cd-be7e9c2eba50`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 176–183.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem injOn_circleMap_of_abs_sub_le {a b R : ℝ} {c : ℂ} (h_R : R ≠ 0) (_ : |a - b| ≤ 2 * π) :
    (Ι a b).InjOn (circleMap c R) := by
  rintro _ ⟨_, _⟩ _ ⟨_, _⟩ h
  apply eq_of_circleMap_eq h_R _ h
  rw [abs_lt]
  constructor <;> linarith [max_sub_min_eq_abs' a b]

/-- `circleMap` is injective on `Ico a b` if the distance between `a` and `b` is at most `2π`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/CircleMap/Variant0c7edcc2ce9a0fd89a7c740b083bb89522a79727d1717d6514230cf3744cda20.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/CircleMap/Variant0c7edcc2ce9a0fd89a7c740b083bb89522a79727d1717d6514230cf3744cda20.lean#L176).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c93ea0cb4dcd0664c2722afb5e6a555b4f1ba30` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
