## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d188b7cd-7094-ac75-585a-a194979130f2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 646–661.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_forall_le_of_isBounded {f : β → α} (hf : Continuous f) (x₀ : β)
    (h : Bornology.IsBounded {x : β | f x ≤ f x₀}) :
    ∃ x, ∀ y, f x ≤ f y := by
  refine hf.exists_forall_le' (x₀ := x₀) ?_
  have hU : {x : β | f x₀ < f x} ∈ Filter.cocompact β := by
    refine Filter.mem_cocompact'.mpr ⟨_, ?_, fun ⦃_⦄ a ↦ a⟩
    simp only [Set.compl_ofPred, not_lt]
    exact Metric.isCompact_of_isClosed_isBounded (isClosed_le (by fun_prop) (by fun_prop)) h
  filter_upwards [hU] with x hx using hx.le

/-- A version of the **Extreme Value Theorem**: if the set where a continuous function `f`
into a linearly ordered space takes values `≥ f x₀` is bounded for some `x₀`,
then `f` has a global maximum (under suitable topological assumptions).

This is a convenient combination of `Continuous.exists_forall_ge'` and
`Metric.isCompact_of_isClosed_isBounded`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Bounded/Variantdbdb5dce531767c8e6b56f004d9d3a4cde9173a5a11ef40733a86cb432cadd2b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Bounded/Variantdbdb5dce531767c8e6b56f004d9d3a4cde9173a5a11ef40733a86cb432cadd2b.lean#L646).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b47b2b389eebc08df32ef3a6f450f350c389cfcd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
