## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:24939f38fa1a10d0a41a2535a85a8466d95168795808af7ca49f4c56e5b25d9b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 567–576.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def piCongrLeft' {ι' : Type*} [Fintype ι] [Fintype ι'] {Y : ι → Type*}
    [∀ j, PseudoEMetricSpace (Y j)] (e : ι ≃ ι') : (∀ i, Y i) ≃ᵢ ∀ j, Y (e.symm j) where
  toEquiv := Equiv.piCongrLeft' _ e
  isometry_toFun x1 x2 := by
    simp_rw [edist_pi_def, Finset.sup_univ_eq_iSup]
    exact (Equiv.iSup_comp (g := fun b ↦ edist (x1 b) (x2 b)) e.symm)

/-- The natural isometry `∀ i, Y (e i) ≃ᵢ ∀ j, Y j` obtained from a bijection `ι ≃ ι'` of fintypes.
`Equiv.piCongrLeft` as an `IsometryEquiv`. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Isometry/Variant353c8fcbacf5d1782a545adbcee6eb0cf3ec7b6d7107bea8311d9036b56b0a3b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Isometry/Variant353c8fcbacf5d1782a545adbcee6eb0cf3ec7b6d7107bea8311d9036b56b0a3b.lean#L567).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c47831d19f76a5642954c01f3596e876d8bd0a57` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
