## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:849ae003f3cb1624c3395f7fd2504ef51b18f69e36f2237713b0a8346b687d32`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 574–580.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def funUnique [Unique ι] [Fintype ι] : (ι → α) ≃ᵢ α where
  toEquiv := Equiv.funUnique ι α
  isometry_toFun x hx := by simp [edist_pi_def, Finset.univ_unique, Finset.sup_singleton]
#align isometry_equiv.fun_unique IsometryEquiv.funUnique

/-- `piFinTwoEquiv` as an `IsometryEquiv`. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Isometry/Variant46a8176e6798618ee1e35fbcacbc30251d68fc0a8db58d028790322974258cdc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Isometry/Variant46a8176e6798618ee1e35fbcacbc30251d68fc0a8db58d028790322974258cdc.lean#L574).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9ac157c161f97062b336a7688d4bef717d26c79a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
