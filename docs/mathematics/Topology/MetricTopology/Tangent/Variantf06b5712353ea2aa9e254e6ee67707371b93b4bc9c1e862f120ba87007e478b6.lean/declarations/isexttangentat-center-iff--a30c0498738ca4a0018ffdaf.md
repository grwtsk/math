## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e4dc9db3-b8de-d71c-0289-7176f704e2d2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 420–433.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isExtTangentAt_center_iff {s₁ s₂ : Sphere P} :
    s₁.IsExtTangentAt s₂ s₁.center ↔ s₁.radius = 0 ∧ s₁.center ∈ s₂ := by
  refine ⟨?_, ?_⟩
  · rintro ⟨h₁, h₂, -⟩
    rw [center_mem_iff] at h₁
    exact ⟨h₁, h₂⟩
  · rintro ⟨hr, hc⟩
    refine ⟨?_, hc, ?_⟩
    · rw [center_mem_iff, hr]
    · simp

/-- The sphere `s₁` is internally tangent to the sphere `s₂` at the point `p` (that is, `s₁` lies
inside `s₂` and is tangent to it at that point). This includes the degenerate case where the
spheres are the same. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Tangent/Variantf06b5712353ea2aa9e254e6ee67707371b93b4bc9c1e862f120ba87007e478b6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Tangent/Variantf06b5712353ea2aa9e254e6ee67707371b93b4bc9c1e862f120ba87007e478b6.lean#L420).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `52c59c192899f975c56964179e20590005db3e2d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
