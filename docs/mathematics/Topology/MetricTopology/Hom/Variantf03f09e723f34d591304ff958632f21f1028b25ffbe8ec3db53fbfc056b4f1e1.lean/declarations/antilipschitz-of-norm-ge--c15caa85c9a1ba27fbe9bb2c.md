## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9fa1a087-2b42-5fbf-44e4-8245480cada4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 158–164.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem antilipschitz_of_norm_ge {K : ℝ≥0} (h : ∀ x, ‖x‖ ≤ K * ‖f x‖) : AntilipschitzWith K f :=
  AntilipschitzWith.of_le_mul_dist fun x y => by simpa only [dist_eq_norm, map_sub] using h (x - y)

/-- A normed group hom is surjective on the subgroup `K` with constant `C` if every element
`x` of `K` has a preimage whose norm is bounded above by `C*‖x‖`. This is a more
abstract version of `f` having a right inverse defined on `K` with operator norm
at most `C`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Hom/Variantf03f09e723f34d591304ff958632f21f1028b25ffbe8ec3db53fbfc056b4f1e1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Hom/Variantf03f09e723f34d591304ff958632f21f1028b25ffbe8ec3db53fbfc056b4f1e1.lean#L158).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `073d37e15a7ac212a199eaa0b3f763ba7b3e97ea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
