## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5c50e9ac9f53b2a58d8c3cc9d16e4aa49799feac5f1acf14a781f34ef5ffd78d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 31–47.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance pseudoMetricSpacePi : PseudoMetricSpace (∀ b, X b) := by
  /- we construct the instance from the pseudoemetric space instance to avoid checking again that
    the uniformity is the same as the product uniformity, but we register nevertheless a nice
    formula for the distance -/
  let i := PseudoEMetricSpace.toPseudoMetricSpaceOfDist
    (fun f g : ∀ b, X b => ((sup univ fun b => nndist (f b) (g b) : ℝ≥0) : ℝ))
    (fun f g => NNReal.zero_le_coe)
    (fun f g => by simp [edist_pi_def])
  refine i.replaceBornology fun s => ?_
  simp only [isBounded_iff_eventually, ← forall_isBounded_image_eval_iff,
    forall_mem_image, ← Filter.eventually_all, @dist_nndist (X _)]
  refine eventually_congr ((eventually_ge_atTop 0).mono fun C hC ↦ ?_)
  lift C to ℝ≥0 using hC
  refine ⟨fun H x hx y hy ↦ NNReal.coe_le_coe.2 <| Finset.sup_le fun b _ ↦ H b hx hy,
    fun H b x hx y hy ↦ NNReal.coe_le_coe.2 ?_⟩
  exact Finset.sup_le_iff.1 (NNReal.coe_le_coe.1 <| H hx hy) b (Finset.mem_univ b)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Pi/Variant6b51bed4dea6753f90b7138b604565f80a9a2cdfb668b1f1860c39c84e1d790e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Pi/Variant6b51bed4dea6753f90b7138b604565f80a9a2cdfb668b1f1860c39c84e1d790e.lean#L31).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27d029ee8e68efb7a99c2399e7cd2678bd5d7889` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
