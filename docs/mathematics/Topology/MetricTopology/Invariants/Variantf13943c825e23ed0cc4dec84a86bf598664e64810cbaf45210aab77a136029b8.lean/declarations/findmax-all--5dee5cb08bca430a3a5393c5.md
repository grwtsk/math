## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fa4a9b89-e852-fc85-ec6e-7bf931e76af9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 523–533.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem findMax'_all {P : α → Prop} : ∀ (x : α) (t), P x → All P t → P (findMax' x t)
  | _x, nil, hx, _ => hx
  | _, node _ _ lx lr, _, ⟨_, h₂, h₃⟩ => findMax'_all lx lr h₂ h₃

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Invariants/Variantf13943c825e23ed0cc4dec84a86bf598664e64810cbaf45210aab77a136029b8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Invariants/Variantf13943c825e23ed0cc4dec84a86bf598664e64810cbaf45210aab77a136029b8.lean#L523).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a506610883264adfd44fa210ddd629b68f9dc01f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
