## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b441636c9e66447662d8e74d58a72b4275fc8d636774846819b9544a7ca31d47`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 84–98.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class DilationClass (F : Type*) (α β : outParam Type*) [PseudoEMetricSpace α] [PseudoEMetricSpace β]
    [FunLike F α β] : Prop where
  edist_eq' : ∀ f : F, ∃ r : ℝ≥0, r ≠ 0 ∧ ∀ x y : α, edist (f x) (f y) = r * edist x y

end Defs

namespace Dilation

variable {α : Type*} {β : Type*} {γ : Type*} {F : Type*}

variable [PseudoEMetricSpace α] [PseudoEMetricSpace β]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Dilation/Variant27dd1c2165b9320cb0798006fd837170adb866d0cba0eefd2a796d20440c3f40.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Dilation/Variant27dd1c2165b9320cb0798006fd837170adb866d0cba0eefd2a796d20440c3f40.lean#L84).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6c7294819de1d2c7cb712a292bfe12befe248109` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
