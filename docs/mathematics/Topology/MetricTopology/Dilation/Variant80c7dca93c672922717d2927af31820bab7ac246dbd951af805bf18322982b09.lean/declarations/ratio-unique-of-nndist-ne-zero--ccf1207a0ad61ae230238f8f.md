## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0c30019b-022f-42a8-de14-4d2104b815de`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 198–206.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ratio_unique_of_nndist_ne_zero {α β F : Type*} [PseudoMetricSpace α] [PseudoMetricSpace β]
    [DilationClass F α β] {f : F} {x y : α} {r : ℝ≥0} (hxy : nndist x y ≠ 0)
    (hr : nndist (f x) (f y) = r * nndist x y) : r = ratio f :=
  ratio_unique (by rwa [edist_nndist, ENNReal.coe_ne_zero]) (edist_ne_top x y)
    (by rw [edist_nndist, edist_nndist, hr, ENNReal.coe_mul])
#align dilation.ratio_unique_of_nndist_ne_zero Dilation.ratio_unique_of_nndist_ne_zero

/-- The `ratio` is equal to the distance ratio for any two points
with nonzero finite distance; `dist` version -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Dilation/Variant80c7dca93c672922717d2927af31820bab7ac246dbd951af805bf18322982b09.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Dilation/Variant80c7dca93c672922717d2927af31820bab7ac246dbd951af805bf18322982b09.lean#L198).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `410d0b9a1cac1c4fc8eb5b2307c6f9b5930da429` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
