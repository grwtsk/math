## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1392fdfe-287a-bb94-3784-a355be507c06`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 130–134.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isometry_extensionEmbedding_of_isReal {v : InfinitePlace K} (hv : IsReal v) :
    Isometry (extensionEmbeddingOfIsReal hv) :=
  Isometry.of_dist_eq (extensionEmbedding_dist_eq_of_comp <| v.norm_embedding_of_isReal hv)

/-- The embedding `v.Completion →+* ℂ` has closed image inside `ℂ`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Completion/Variant677637474c85ca3bc9c33626367fb1f948164af39301d55111574b51af57ced7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Completion/Variant677637474c85ca3bc9c33626367fb1f948164af39301d55111574b51af57ced7.lean#L130).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `af008840c4c6fdc9fe278e39eb0e42bc8f3abe88` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
