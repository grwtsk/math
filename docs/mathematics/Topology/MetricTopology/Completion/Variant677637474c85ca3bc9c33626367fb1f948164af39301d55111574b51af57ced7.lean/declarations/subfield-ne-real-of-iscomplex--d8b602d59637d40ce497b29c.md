## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c5a8fca-998f-7dca-5e0f-a869cd3a0d50`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–152.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem subfield_ne_real_of_isComplex {v : InfinitePlace K} (hv : IsComplex v) :
    (extensionEmbedding v).fieldRange ≠ Complex.ofRealHom.fieldRange := by
  contrapose! hv
  simp only [not_isComplex_iff_isReal, isReal_iff]
  ext x
  obtain ⟨r, hr⟩ := hv ▸ extensionEmbedding_coe v x ▸ RingHom.mem_fieldRange_self _ _
  simp only [ComplexEmbedding.conjugate_coe_eq, ← hr, Complex.ofRealHom_eq_coe, Complex.conj_ofReal]

/-- If `v` is a complex infinite place, then the embedding `v.Completion →+* ℂ` is surjective. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Completion/Variant677637474c85ca3bc9c33626367fb1f948164af39301d55111574b51af57ced7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Completion/Variant677637474c85ca3bc9c33626367fb1f948164af39301d55111574b51af57ced7.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `af008840c4c6fdc9fe278e39eb0e42bc8f3abe88` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
