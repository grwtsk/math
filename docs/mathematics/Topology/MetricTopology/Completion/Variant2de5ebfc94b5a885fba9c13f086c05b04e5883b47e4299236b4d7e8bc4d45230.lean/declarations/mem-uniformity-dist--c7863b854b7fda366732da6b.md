## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:764ce3f5-1a7a-5ea3-0761-8fac48d24178`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 85–136.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  constructor
  · /- Start from an entourage `s`. It contains a closed entourage `t`. Its pullback in `α` is an
      entourage, so it contains an `ε`-neighborhood of the diagonal by definition of the entourages
      in metric spaces. Then `t` contains an `ε`-neighborhood of the diagonal in `Completion α`, as
      closed properties pass to the completion. -/

  · /- Start from a set `s` containing an ε-neighborhood of the diagonal in `Completion α`. To show
        that it is an entourage, we use the fact that `dist` is uniformly continuous on
        `Completion α × Completion α` (this is a general property of the extension of uniformly
        continuous functions). Therefore, the preimage of the ε-neighborhood of the diagonal in ℝ
        is an entourage in `Completion α × Completion α`. Massaging this property, it follows that
        the ε-neighborhood of the diagonal is an entourage in `Completion α`, and therefore this is
        also the case of `s`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Completion/Variant2de5ebfc94b5a885fba9c13f086c05b04e5883b47e4299236b4d7e8bc4d45230.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Completion/Variant2de5ebfc94b5a885fba9c13f086c05b04e5883b47e4299236b4d7e8bc4d45230.lean#L85).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `293d0fcb7bf25db2093bba50ce8263382d3821ec` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
