## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a20349a816565e0e3f9a6abc4db3097818674b928f263d584e3e542af5dd40a7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 248–261.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instNormedSpace [NormedField 𝕜] [NormedSpace 𝕜 β] : NormedSpace 𝕜 (α →ᵇ β) :=
  ⟨fun c f => by
    refine norm_ofNormedAddCommGroup_le _ (mul_nonneg (norm_nonneg _) (norm_nonneg _)) ?_
    exact fun x =>
      norm_smul c (f x) ▸ mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left (f.norm_coe_le_norm _) (norm_nonneg _)⟩

variable [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜] [NormedSpace 𝕜 β]
variable [SeminormedAddCommGroup γ] [NormedSpace 𝕜 γ]
variable (α)

-- TODO does this work in the `IsBoundedSMul` setting, too?
/-- Postcomposition of bounded continuous functions into a normed module by a continuous linear map
is a continuous linear map.
Upgraded version of `ContinuousLinearMap.compLeftContinuous`, similar to `LinearMap.compLeft`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Normed/Varianta7f3c53b27b5b517702652ef6d440dceeda7440a11075df79ef4e94093c0dae2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Normed/Varianta7f3c53b27b5b517702652ef6d440dceeda7440a11075df79ef4e94093c0dae2.lean#L248).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1ce5689f03c0829f322a527247cf3d3596eb49ee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
