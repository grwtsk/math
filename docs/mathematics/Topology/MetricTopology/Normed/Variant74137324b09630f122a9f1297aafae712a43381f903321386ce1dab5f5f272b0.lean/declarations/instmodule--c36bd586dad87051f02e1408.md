## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f5c876ddd15e721d93803306a643856bac2c992e35bd96e35a9a7ecc0f5fd1c5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 483–492.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instModule' : Module (α →ᵇ 𝕜) (α →ᵇ β) :=
  Module.ofMinimalAxioms
      (fun c _ _ => ext fun a => smul_add (c a) _ _)
      (fun _ _ _ => ext fun _ => add_smul _ _ _)
      (fun _ _ _ => ext fun _ => mul_smul _ _ _)
      (fun f => ext fun x => one_smul 𝕜 (f x))

/- TODO: When `NormedModule` has been added to `Analysis.Normed.Module.Basic`, this
shows that the space of bounded continuous functions from `α` to `β` is naturally a normed
module over the algebra of bounded continuous functions from `α` to `𝕜`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Normed/Variant74137324b09630f122a9f1297aafae712a43381f903321386ce1dab5f5f272b0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Normed/Variant74137324b09630f122a9f1297aafae712a43381f903321386ce1dab5f5f272b0.lean#L483).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3a8455226a8b93d19a0e9139efb131b0a6670280` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
