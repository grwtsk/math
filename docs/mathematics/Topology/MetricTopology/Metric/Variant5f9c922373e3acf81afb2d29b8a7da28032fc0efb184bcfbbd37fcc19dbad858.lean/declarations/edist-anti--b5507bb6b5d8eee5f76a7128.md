## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1638d236-0dd1-0453-ab19-dbf5d87de087`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–170.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem edist_anti {G' : SimpleGraph V} (h : G ≤ G') :
    G'.edist u v ≤ G.edist u v := by
  by_cases hr : G.Reachable u v
  · obtain ⟨_, hw⟩ := hr.exists_walk_length_eq_edist
    rw [← hw, ← Walk.length_map (.ofLE h)]
    apply edist_le
  · exact edist_eq_top_of_not_reachable hr ▸ le_top

end edist

section dist

/--
The distance between two vertices is the length of the shortest walk between them.
If no such walk exists, this uses the junk value of `0`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Metric/Variant5f9c922373e3acf81afb2d29b8a7da28032fc0efb184bcfbbd37fcc19dbad858.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Metric/Variant5f9c922373e3acf81afb2d29b8a7da28032fc0efb184bcfbbd37fcc19dbad858.lean#L155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `af4579105ccbb581e1d072662630b704c007c8af` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
