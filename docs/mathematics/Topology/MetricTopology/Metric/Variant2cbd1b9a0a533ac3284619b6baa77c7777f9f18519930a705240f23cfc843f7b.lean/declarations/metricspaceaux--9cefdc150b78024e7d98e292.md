## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9627bb6127dd23bbcb26f711917d7b33aff10406ed3c9c334b3166117ef96fca`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def metricSpaceAux : MetricSpace ℍ where
  dist := dist
  dist_self z := by rw [dist_eq, dist_self, zero_div, arsinh_zero, mul_zero]
  dist_comm := UpperHalfPlane.dist_comm
  dist_triangle := UpperHalfPlane.dist_triangle
  eq_of_dist_eq_zero {z w} h := by
    simpa [dist_eq, Real.sqrt_eq_zero', (mul_pos z.im_pos w.im_pos).not_le, Set.ext_iff] using h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Metric/Variant2cbd1b9a0a533ac3284619b6baa77c7777f9f18519930a705240f23cfc843f7b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Metric/Variant2cbd1b9a0a533ac3284619b6baa77c7777f9f18519930a705240f23cfc843f7b.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6483d621ed3327fc861996655715a987fd1388ca` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
