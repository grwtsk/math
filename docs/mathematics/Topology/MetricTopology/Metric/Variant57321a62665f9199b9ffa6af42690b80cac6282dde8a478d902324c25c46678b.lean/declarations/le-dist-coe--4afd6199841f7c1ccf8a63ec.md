## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:267655b6-3c53-645b-afa5-5c2a7c177506`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 248–256.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem le_dist_coe (z w : ℍ) : w.im * (1 - Real.exp (-dist z w)) ≤ dist (z : ℂ) w :=
  calc
    w.im * (1 - Real.exp (-dist z w)) =
        dist (z : ℂ) (w.center (dist z w)) - dist (w : ℂ) (w.center (dist z w)) := by
      rw [dist_center_dist, dist_self_center, ← Real.cosh_sub_sinh]; ring
    _ ≤ dist (z : ℂ) w := sub_le_iff_le_add.2 <| dist_triangle _ _ _

/-- The hyperbolic metric on the upper half plane. We ensure that the projection to
`TopologicalSpace` is definitionally equal to the subtype topology. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Metric/Variant57321a62665f9199b9ffa6af42690b80cac6282dde8a478d902324c25c46678b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Metric/Variant57321a62665f9199b9ffa6af42690b80cac6282dde8a478d902324c25c46678b.lean#L248).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e7a86170063b026c6051d38a69c6d1bcb31babd6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
