## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:04360d93-7d4e-5888-68d9-f2d127107ac0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–70.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    cosh (dist z w / 2) = dist (z : ℂ) (conj (w : ℂ)) / (2 * sqrt (z.im * w.im)) := by
  have H₁ : (2 ^ 2 : ℝ) = 4 := by norm_num1
  have H₂ : 0 < z.im * w.im := mul_pos z.im_pos w.im_pos
  have H₃ : 0 < 2 * sqrt (z.im * w.im) := mul_pos two_pos (sqrt_pos.2 H₂)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Metric/Variant2136ca2dab3dab9cd50af774600b979b328b3cde330bc35d3dd31eabed7adb9e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Metric/Variant2136ca2dab3dab9cd50af774600b979b328b3cde330bc35d3dd31eabed7adb9e.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `49b8f8a80e6c4ab8b0dd447fa708525d276f186d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
