## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:09c9e8a4-43e1-4c96-8357-085585004d45`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 777–789.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem totallyBounded_iff' {s : Set α} :
    TotallyBounded s ↔ ∀ ε > 0, ∃ t, t ⊆ s ∧ Set.Finite t ∧ s ⊆ ⋃ y ∈ t, ball y ε :=
  ⟨fun H _ε ε0 => (totallyBounded_iff_subset.1 H) _ (edist_mem_uniformity ε0), fun H _r ru =>
    let ⟨ε, ε0, hε⟩ := mem_uniformity_edist.1 ru
    let ⟨t, _, ft, h⟩ := H ε ε0
    ⟨t, ft, h.trans <| iUnion₂_mono fun _ _ _ => hε⟩⟩
#align emetric.totally_bounded_iff' EMetric.totallyBounded_iff'

section Compact

-- porting note: todo: generalize to a uniform space with metrizable uniformity
/-- For a set `s` in a pseudo emetric space, if for every `ε > 0` there exists a countable
set that is `ε`-dense in `s`, then there exists a countable subset `t ⊆ s` that is dense in `s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant847e738685d963f94bb097ac8b6fef940b8a7fd3b64ee30e1bcf6450c5bc71c2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant847e738685d963f94bb097ac8b6fef940b8a7fd3b64ee30e1bcf6450c5bc71c2.lean#L777).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5c631544583800fff714f3c40b9cb1bd86e51e7b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
