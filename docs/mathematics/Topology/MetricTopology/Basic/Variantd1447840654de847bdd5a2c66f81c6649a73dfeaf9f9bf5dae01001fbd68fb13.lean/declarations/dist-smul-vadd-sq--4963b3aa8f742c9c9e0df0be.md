## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:21236de1-d5b8-ac3e-8fee-5abba91fe14c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–98.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dist_smul_vadd_sq (r : ℝ) (v : V) (p₁ p₂ : P) :
    dist (r • v +ᵥ p₁) p₂ * dist (r • v +ᵥ p₁) p₂ =
      ⟪v, v⟫ * r * r + 2 * ⟪v, p₁ -ᵥ p₂⟫ * r + ⟪p₁ -ᵥ p₂, p₁ -ᵥ p₂⟫ := by
  rw [dist_eq_norm_vsub V _ p₂, ← real_inner_self_eq_norm_mul_norm, vadd_vsub_assoc,
    real_inner_add_add_self, real_inner_smul_left, real_inner_smul_left, real_inner_smul_right]
  ring

/-- The condition for two points on a line to be equidistant from
another point. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variantd1447840654de847bdd5a2c66f81c6649a73dfeaf9f9bf5dae01001fbd68fb13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variantd1447840654de847bdd5a2c66f81c6649a73dfeaf9f9bf5dae01001fbd68fb13.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6a328b2b5cb3b73ebf9c2efe556a25bf7562b8ce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
