## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0fbaeb23-eb0b-89d8-80d0-690a94f4dcda`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 304–315.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsSeparable.exists_countable_dense_subset
    {s : Set α} (hs : IsSeparable s) : ∃ t, t ⊆ s ∧ t.Countable ∧ s ⊆ closure t := by
  have : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ t : Set α, t.Countable ∧ s ⊆ ⋃ x ∈ t, closedBall x ε := fun ε ε0 => by
    rcases hs with ⟨t, htc, hst⟩
    refine ⟨t, htc, hst.trans fun x hx => ?_⟩
    rcases mem_closure_iff.1 hx ε ε0 with ⟨y, hyt, hxy⟩
    exact mem_iUnion₂.2 ⟨y, hyt, mem_closedBall.2 hxy.le⟩
  exact subset_countable_closure_of_almost_dense_set _ this

/-- If a set `s` is separable, then the corresponding subtype is separable in a (pseudo extended)
metric space.  This is not obvious, as the countable set whose closure covers `s` does not need in
general to be contained in `s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant145c1309d580c1c3db3d6e43640b53637238ff19b674841990ffb0b51c0f3735.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant145c1309d580c1c3db3d6e43640b53637238ff19b674841990ffb0b51c0f3735.lean#L304).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6d82b893419269f80478c8a70e46cecb48ca8b8b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
