## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8cde0914-08ec-f7e1-12ff-8f0088213309`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 159–166.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendstoLocallyUniformly_iff [TopologicalSpace β] {F : ι → β → α} {f : β → α}
    {p : Filter ι} :
    TendstoLocallyUniformly F f p ↔
      ∀ ε > 0, ∀ x : β, ∃ t ∈ 𝓝 x, ∀ᶠ n in p, ∀ y ∈ t, dist (f y) (F n y) < ε := by
  simp only [← tendstoLocallyUniformlyOn_univ, tendstoLocallyUniformlyOn_iff, nhdsWithin_univ,
    mem_univ, forall_const]

/-- Expressing uniform convergence using `dist`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant8067bc89d7e62c447e2a31a09327361777fc5619bfabb95746278dc65cd161dd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant8067bc89d7e62c447e2a31a09327361777fc5619bfabb95746278dc65cd161dd.lean#L159).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2f2f519ce058863da937de627e501864f1a3664e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
