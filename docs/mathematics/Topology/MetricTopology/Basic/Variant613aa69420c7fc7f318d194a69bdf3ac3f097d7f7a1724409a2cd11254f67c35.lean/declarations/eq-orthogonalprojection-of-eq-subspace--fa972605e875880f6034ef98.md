## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8d123585-60ba-de67-161c-17ab86a47b05`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 402–409.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem eq_orthogonalProjection_of_eq_subspace {s s' : AffineSubspace ℝ P} [Nonempty s]
    [Nonempty s'] [HasOrthogonalProjection s.direction] [HasOrthogonalProjection s'.direction]
    (h : s = s') (p : P) : (orthogonalProjection s p : P) = (orthogonalProjection s' p : P) := by
  subst h

#align euclidean_geometry.eq_orthogonal_projection_of_eq_subspace EuclideanGeometry.eq_orthogonalProjection_of_eq_subspace

/-- The distance to a point's orthogonal projection is 0 iff it lies in the subspace. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant613aa69420c7fc7f318d194a69bdf3ac3f097d7f7a1724409a2cd11254f67c35.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant613aa69420c7fc7f318d194a69bdf3ac3f097d7f7a1724409a2cd11254f67c35.lean#L402).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bcc38e3ed3951a95f60ac3a102597c3c77c25ece` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
