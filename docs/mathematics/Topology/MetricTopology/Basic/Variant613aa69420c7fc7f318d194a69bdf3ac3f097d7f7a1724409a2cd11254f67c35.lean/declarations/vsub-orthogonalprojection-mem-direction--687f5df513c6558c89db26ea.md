## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5640e1ed-b9e4-c913-9801-70227fa1a21c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 365–372.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem vsub_orthogonalProjection_mem_direction {s : AffineSubspace ℝ P} [Nonempty s]
    [HasOrthogonalProjection s.direction] {p1 : P} (p2 : P) (hp1 : p1 ∈ s) :
    ↑((⟨p1, hp1⟩ : s) -ᵥ orthogonalProjection s p2 : s.direction) ∈ s.direction :=
  ((⟨p1, hp1⟩ : s) -ᵥ orthogonalProjection s p2 : s.direction).2
#align euclidean_geometry.vsub_orthogonal_projection_mem_direction EuclideanGeometry.vsub_orthogonalProjection_mem_direction

/-- A point equals its orthogonal projection if and only if it lies in
the subspace. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant613aa69420c7fc7f318d194a69bdf3ac3f097d7f7a1724409a2cd11254f67c35.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant613aa69420c7fc7f318d194a69bdf3ac3f097d7f7a1724409a2cd11254f67c35.lean#L365).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bcc38e3ed3951a95f60ac3a102597c3c77c25ece` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
