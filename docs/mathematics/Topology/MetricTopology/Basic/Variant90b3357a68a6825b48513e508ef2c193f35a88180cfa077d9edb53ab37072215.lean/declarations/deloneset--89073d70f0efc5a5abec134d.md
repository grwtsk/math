## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:52226ae206c5efee79afea34ff9744d2d8a31b7e542dc7ba7c89e909d7273b97`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 74–88.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure DeloneSet (X : Type*) [MetricSpace X] where
  /-- The underlying set. -/
  carrier : Set X
  /-- Radius such that distinct points of `carrier` are separated by more than `r`. -/
  packingRadius : ℝ≥0
  packingRadius_pos : 0 < packingRadius
  isSeparated_packingRadius : IsSeparated packingRadius carrier
  /-- Radius such that every point of the space is within `R` of `carrier`. -/
  coveringRadius : ℝ≥0
  coveringRadius_pos : 0 < coveringRadius
  isCover_coveringRadius : IsCover coveringRadius .univ carrier

namespace DeloneSet

/-- The underlying set of points of a Delone set. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant90b3357a68a6825b48513e508ef2c193f35a88180cfa077d9edb53ab37072215.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant90b3357a68a6825b48513e508ef2c193f35a88180cfa077d9edb53ab37072215.lean#L74).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e179c7d2e810521e98807bfea655acb23b367d5e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
