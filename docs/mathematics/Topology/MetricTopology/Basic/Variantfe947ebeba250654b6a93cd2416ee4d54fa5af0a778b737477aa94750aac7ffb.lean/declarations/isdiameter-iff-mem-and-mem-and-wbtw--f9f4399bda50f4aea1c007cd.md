## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:46bfb838-d298-50e9-a19b-2ff4ff594cdb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 490–501.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isDiameter_iff_mem_and_mem_and_wbtw :
    s.IsDiameter p₁ p₂ ↔ p₁ ∈ s ∧ p₂ ∈ s ∧ Wbtw ℝ p₁ s.center p₂:= by
  refine ⟨fun h ↦ ⟨h.left_mem, h.right_mem, h.wbtw⟩, fun ⟨h₁, h₂, hr⟩ ↦ ?_⟩
  have hd := hr.dist_add_dist
  rw [mem_sphere.1 h₁, mem_sphere'.1 h₂, ← two_mul, eq_comm] at hd
  exact isDiameter_iff_mem_and_mem_and_dist.2 ⟨h₁, h₂, hd⟩

end Sphere

end EuclideanSpace

end EuclideanGeometry
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variantfe947ebeba250654b6a93cd2416ee4d54fa5af0a778b737477aa94750aac7ffb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variantfe947ebeba250654b6a93cd2416ee4d54fa5af0a778b737477aa94750aac7ffb.lean#L490).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ce18d7ccd2f432d9fca9b7b7b8e53460b8b9a8c8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
