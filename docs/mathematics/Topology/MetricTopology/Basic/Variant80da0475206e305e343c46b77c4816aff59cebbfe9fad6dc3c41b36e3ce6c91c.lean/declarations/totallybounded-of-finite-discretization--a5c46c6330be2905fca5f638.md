## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0cd22698-7e4a-50a8-5c27-6ca586b72fa1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 101–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

        ∃ (β : Type u) (_ : Fintype β) (F : s → β), ∀ x y, F x = F y → dist (x : α) y < ε) :

  rcases H ε ε0 with ⟨β, fβ, F, hF⟩
  let Finv := Function.invFun F
  refine ⟨range (Subtype.val ∘ Finv), finite_range _, fun x xs => ?_⟩
  let x' := Finv (F ⟨x, xs⟩)
  have : F x' = F ⟨x, xs⟩ := Function.invFun_eq ⟨⟨x, xs⟩, rfl⟩
  simp only [Set.mem_iUnion, Set.mem_range]
  exact ⟨_, ⟨F ⟨x, xs⟩, rfl⟩, hF _ _ this.symm⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant80da0475206e305e343c46b77c4816aff59cebbfe9fad6dc3c41b36e3ce6c91c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant80da0475206e305e343c46b77c4816aff59cebbfe9fad6dc3c41b36e3ce6c91c.lean#L101).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `481819ce8af510c9a5de64ea11361fadaad4d113` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
