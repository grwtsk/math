## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8a905cc2ca53ee58ebad38274a6ce8bab6071f203a1daf0a663db65b012a57ed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1108–1128.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
meta def evalAddNorm : PositivityExt where eval {u α} _ pα? e :=
  match pα? with | none => pure .none | some _ => do
  match u, α, e with
  | 0, ~q(ℝ), ~q(@Norm.norm $E $_n $a) =>
    let _seminormedAddGroup_E ← synthInstanceQ q(SeminormedAddGroup $E)
    assertInstancesCommute
    -- Check whether we are in a normed group and whether the context contains a `a ≠ 0` assumption
    let o : Option (Q(NormedAddGroup $E) × Q($a ≠ 0)) ← do
      let .some normedAddGroup_E ← trySynthInstanceQ q(NormedAddGroup $E) | pure none
      let some pa ← findLocalDeclWithTypeQ? q($a ≠ 0) | pure none
      pure <| some (normedAddGroup_E, pa)
    match o with
    -- If so, return a proof of `0 < ‖a‖`
    | some (_normedAddGroup_E, pa) =>
      assertInstancesCommute
      return .positive q(norm_pos_iff.2 $pa)
    -- Else, return a proof of `0 ≤ ‖a‖`
    | none => return .nonnegative q(norm_nonneg $a)
  | _, _, _ => throwError "not `‖·‖`"

end Mathlib.Meta.Positivity
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant105fb616f544fc3c820249ef539a67784c901bd8eb42073ec8b0e1446b6fbf82.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant105fb616f544fc3c820249ef539a67784c901bd8eb42073ec8b0e1446b6fbf82.lean#L1108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `01b75c51d9315887c05c04824e0a4e47aec3985d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
