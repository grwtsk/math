## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7a1e3556-006d-8c54-af7d-26e4c29a9b83`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 223–227.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected nonrec theorem ContinuousWithinAt.inversion (hc : ContinuousWithinAt c s a₀)
    (hR : ContinuousWithinAt R s a₀) (hx : ContinuousWithinAt x s a₀) (hne : x a₀ ≠ c a₀) :
    ContinuousWithinAt (fun a ↦ inversion (c a) (R a) (x a)) s a₀ :=
  hc.inversion hR hx hne

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant86f3b515a542055a24113c04159a9a488d1114e3520c98aa37ec0f1e1ea128fc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant86f3b515a542055a24113c04159a9a488d1114e3520c98aa37ec0f1e1ea128fc.lean#L223).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `29906d71d40aff862123d44634945ae14980abe2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
