## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fc92c55e-5b83-8504-a9c6-320c71958ec2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 98–110.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dist_inversion_center (c x : P) (R : ℝ) : dist (inversion c R x) c = R ^ 2 / dist x c := by
  rcases eq_or_ne x c with (rfl | hx)
  · simp
  have : dist x c ≠ 0 := dist_ne_zero.2 hx
  -- was `field_simp [inversion, norm_smul, abs_div, ← dist_eq_norm_vsub, sq, mul_assoc]`,
  -- but really slow. Replaced by `simp only ...` to speed up.
  -- TODO(https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/15486): reinstate `field_simp` once it is faster.
  simp (disch := field_simp_discharge) only [inversion, sq, mul_div_assoc', div_mul_eq_mul_div,
    div_div, dist_vadd_left, norm_smul, norm_div, norm_mul, Real.norm_eq_abs, abs_mul_abs_self,
    abs_dist, ← dist_eq_norm_vsub, mul_assoc, eq_div_iff, div_eq_iff]

/-- Distance from the center of an inversion to the image of a point under the inversion. This
formula accidentally works for `x = c`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant86f3b515a542055a24113c04159a9a488d1114e3520c98aa37ec0f1e1ea128fc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variant86f3b515a542055a24113c04159a9a488d1114e3520c98aa37ec0f1e1ea128fc.lean#L98).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `29906d71d40aff862123d44634945ae14980abe2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
