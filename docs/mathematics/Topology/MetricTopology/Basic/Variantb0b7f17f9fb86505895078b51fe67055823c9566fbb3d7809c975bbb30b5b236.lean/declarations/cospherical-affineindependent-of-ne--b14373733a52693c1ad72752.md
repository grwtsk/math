## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7f0ff97d-e1aa-6480-f608-4d9489adf5ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 373–382.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Cospherical.affineIndependent_of_ne {p₁ p₂ p₃ : P} (hs : Cospherical ({p₁, p₂, p₃} : Set P))
    (h₁₂ : p₁ ≠ p₂) (h₁₃ : p₁ ≠ p₃) (h₂₃ : p₂ ≠ p₃) : AffineIndependent ℝ ![p₁, p₂, p₃] :=
  hs.affineIndependent_of_mem_of_ne (Set.mem_insert _ _)
    (Set.mem_insert_of_mem _ (Set.mem_insert _ _))
    (Set.mem_insert_of_mem _ (Set.mem_insert_of_mem _ (Set.mem_singleton _))) h₁₂ h₁₃ h₂₃

/-- Suppose that `p₁` and `p₂` lie in spheres `s₁` and `s₂`. Then the vector between the centers
of those spheres is orthogonal to that between `p₁` and `p₂`; this is a version of
`inner_vsub_vsub_of_dist_eq_of_dist_eq` for bundled spheres. (In two dimensions, this says that
the diagonals of a kite are orthogonal.) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variantb0b7f17f9fb86505895078b51fe67055823c9566fbb3d7809c975bbb30b5b236.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Basic/Variantb0b7f17f9fb86505895078b51fe67055823c9566fbb3d7809c975bbb30b5b236.lean#L373).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `554f03b1db2739bec6345283c07b3c24759a12fa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
