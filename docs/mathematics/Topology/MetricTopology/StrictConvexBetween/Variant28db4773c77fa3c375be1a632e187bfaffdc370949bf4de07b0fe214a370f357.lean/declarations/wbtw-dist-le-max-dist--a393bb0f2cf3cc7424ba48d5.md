## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:521ceb21-0fc6-61ec-94c6-79a6076c167d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–63.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  by_cases hp₁ : p₂ = p₁; · simp [hp₁]
  by_cases hp₃ : p₂ = p₃; · simp [hp₃]
  have hs : Sbtw ℝ p₁ p₂ p₃ := ⟨h, hp₁, hp₃⟩
  exact (hs.dist_lt_max_dist _).le

/-- Given three collinear points, two (not equal) with distance `r` from `p` and one with
distance at most `r` from `p`, the third point is weakly between the other two points. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/StrictConvexBetween/Variant28db4773c77fa3c375be1a632e187bfaffdc370949bf4de07b0fe214a370f357.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/StrictConvexBetween/Variant28db4773c77fa3c375be1a632e187bfaffdc370949bf4de07b0fe214a370f357.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e03dc2e463bc31147d9792cf9629e39e52e33c8b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
