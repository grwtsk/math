## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8a9cc5cd-133e-e946-a690-c46f07315703`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 135–145.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma eq_midpoint_of_dist_eq_half (hx : dist x y = dist x z / 2) (hy : dist y z = dist x z / 2) :
    y = midpoint ℝ x z := by
  apply eq_lineMap_of_dist_eq_mul_of_dist_eq_mul
  · rwa [invOf_eq_inv, ← div_eq_inv_mul]
  · rwa [invOf_eq_inv, ← one_div, sub_half, one_div, ← div_eq_inv_mul]

namespace Isometry

/-- An isometry of `NormedAddTorsor`s for real normed spaces, strictly convex in the case of the
codomain, is an affine isometry.  Unlike Mazur-Ulam, this does not require the isometry to be
surjective. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/StrictConvexBetween/Variantab3f6fcdf342682213a66af07bf9f40e2001e4eef510f682dfbcbf0ab7780645.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/StrictConvexBetween/Variantab3f6fcdf342682213a66af07bf9f40e2001e4eef510f682dfbcbf0ab7780645.lean#L135).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `186f1fa55e016220f96a4ab09252ab5b22957aed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
