## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5303f5de-1746-487c-1a04-a5acba39cba4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 330–340.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem continuousAt_of_locally_lipschitz {x : α} {r : ℝ} (hr : 0 < r) (K : ℝ)
    (h : ∀ y, dist y x < r → dist (f y) (f x) ≤ K * dist y x) : ContinuousAt f x := by
  -- We use `h` to squeeze `dist (f y) (f x)` between `0` and `K * dist y x`
  refine tendsto_iff_dist_tendsto_zero.2 (squeeze_zero' (Eventually.of_forall fun _ => dist_nonneg)
    (mem_of_superset (ball_mem_nhds _ hr) h) ?_)
  -- Then show that `K * dist y x` tends to zero as `y → x`
  refine (continuous_const.mul (continuous_id.dist continuous_const)).tendsto' _ _ ?_
  simp

/-- A function `f : α → ℝ` which is `K`-Lipschitz on a subset `s` admits a `K`-Lipschitz extension
to the whole space. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Lipschitz/Variant9c0a7e0e35957652a9d69415efcf0740c875cf1f04dae9e796f15ca0604abad1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Lipschitz/Variant9c0a7e0e35957652a9d69415efcf0740c875cf1f04dae9e796f15ca0604abad1.lean#L330).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `740ec94cad053b21fefd36d0ac89940ca97fd0e0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
