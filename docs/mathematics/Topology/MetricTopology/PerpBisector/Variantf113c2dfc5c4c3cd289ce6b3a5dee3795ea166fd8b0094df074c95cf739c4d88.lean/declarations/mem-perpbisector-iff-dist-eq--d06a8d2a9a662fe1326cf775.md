## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:312a0efe-c1bb-c042-3533-11ce98ed547f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 96–100.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_perpBisector_iff_dist_eq : c ∈ perpBisector p₁ p₂ ↔ dist c p₁ = dist c p₂ := by
  rw [dist_eq_norm_vsub V, dist_eq_norm_vsub V, ← real_inner_add_sub_eq_zero_iff,
    vsub_sub_vsub_cancel_left, inner_add_left, add_eq_zero_iff_eq_neg, ← inner_neg_right,
    neg_vsub_eq_vsub_rev, mem_perpBisector_iff_inner_eq_inner]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/PerpBisector/Variantf113c2dfc5c4c3cd289ce6b3a5dee3795ea166fd8b0094df074c95cf739c4d88.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/PerpBisector/Variantf113c2dfc5c4c3cd289ce6b3a5dee3795ea166fd8b0094df074c95cf739c4d88.lean#L96).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fddeb8958b65578f4abf112a206f09df8038b690` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
