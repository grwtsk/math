## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3bb70bbd1bc856305f91e9e7ebcfd5af07e76ff91d9b1fa3b5a64df14b45727f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 585–589.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Additive.isometricVAdd' [Mul M] [PseudoEMetricSpace M] [IsometricSMul M M] :
    IsometricVAdd (Additive M) (Additive M) :=
  ⟨fun c x y => edist_smul_left (toMul c) (toMul x) (toMul y)⟩
#align additive.has_isometric_vadd' Additive.isometricVAdd'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/IsometricSMul/Variantd3f928e1f4109aa9550968cb48103413d3cce2148745b69621028ff00528635d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/IsometricSMul/Variantd3f928e1f4109aa9550968cb48103413d3cce2148745b69621028ff00528635d.lean#L585).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `61bed760883cc2fe34c39cc3109ed6646e7114f7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
