## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6f57a204-2d3b-61c2-3a62-bfca083a09a2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 205–212.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem range_toContinuousMap :
    range toContinuousMap =
      {f : C(Icc v.tMin v.tMax, E) | f v.t₀ = v.x₀ ∧ LipschitzWith v.C f} := by
  ext f; constructor
  · rintro ⟨⟨f, hf₀, hf_lip⟩, rfl⟩; exact ⟨hf₀, hf_lip⟩
  · rcases f with ⟨f, hf⟩; rintro ⟨hf₀, hf_lip⟩; exact ⟨⟨f, hf₀, hf_lip⟩, rfl⟩
#align picard_lindelof.fun_space.range_to_continuous_map PicardLindelof.FunSpace.range_toContinuousMap

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/PicardLindelof/Variantc7bd841b7bc39d49075dec0680a93d8d1daed045b1c9f0711ca0eaec4db12b20.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/PicardLindelof/Variantc7bd841b7bc39d49075dec0680a93d8d1daed045b1c9f0711ca0eaec4db12b20.lean#L205).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `453afc79087439710666327a609f0f22e9a6d64c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
