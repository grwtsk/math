## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0c07ad25-0418-1c26-b988-32f9a68712f7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 170–174.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_iff_infEdist_zero_of_closed (h : IsClosed s) : x ∈ s ↔ infEdist x s = 0 := by
  rw [← mem_closure_iff_infEdist_zero, h.closure_eq]

/-- The infimum edistance of a point to a set is positive if and only if the point is not in the
closure of the set. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/HausdorffDistance/Variant607242f4f83de09620da6d4ba26b151c4893d316c0ae8956ad83e758e71bff20.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/HausdorffDistance/Variant607242f4f83de09620da6d4ba26b151c4893d316c0ae8956ad83e758e71bff20.lean#L170).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e92f771aecf9d98f8d9bab7c1349bc58b8838869` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
