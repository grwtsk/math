## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:011c876d-0383-75dd-1a62-9ce801b56821`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 320–334.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_circumcenter_of_dist_eq {n : ℕ} (s : Simplex ℝ P n) {p : P}
    (hp : p ∈ affineSpan ℝ (Set.range s.points)) {r : ℝ} (hr : ∀ i, dist (s.points i) p = r) :
    p = s.circumcenter := by
  have h := s.circumsphere_unique_dist_eq.2 ⟨p, r⟩
  simp only [hp, hr, forall_const, eq_self_iff_true, subset_sphere, Sphere.ext_iff,
    Set.forall_range_iff, mem_sphere, true_and] at h
  -- Porting note: added the next three lines (`simp` less powerful)
  rw [subset_sphere (s := ⟨p, r⟩)] at h
  simp only [hp, hr, forall_const, eq_self_iff_true, subset_sphere, Sphere.ext_iff,
    Set.forall_range_iff, mem_sphere, true_and] at h
  exact h.1
#align affine.simplex.eq_circumcenter_of_dist_eq Affine.Simplex.eq_circumcenter_of_dist_eq

/-- Given a point in the affine span from which all the points are
equidistant, that distance is the circumradius. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/Circumcenter/Variantdc4373d6ceb3e3886ce2bbf0be47af28927db468881d60896f562639794ab46b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/Circumcenter/Variantdc4373d6ceb3e3886ce2bbf0be47af28927db468881d60896f562639794ab46b.lean#L320).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7ba8c6dafdd8ef0c57d32577e2c52afe37fa3d86` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
