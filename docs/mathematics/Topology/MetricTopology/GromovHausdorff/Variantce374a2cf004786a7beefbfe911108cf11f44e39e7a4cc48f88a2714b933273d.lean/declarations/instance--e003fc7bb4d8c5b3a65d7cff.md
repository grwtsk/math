## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e24dff4bdda8f8b84d100bf3372fd949249e84bf288875a6c8f20a2525d6b181`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 616–734.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  /- As the target space of F is countable, it suffices to show that two points
  `p` and `q` with `F p = F q` are at distance `≤ δ`.
  For this, we construct a map `Φ` from `s p ⊆ p.Rep` (representing `p`)
  to `q.Rep` (representing `q`) which is almost an isometry on `s p`, and
  with image `s q`. For this, we compose the identification of `s p` with `Fin (N p)`
  and the inverse of the identification of `s q` with `Fin (N q)`. Together with
  the fact that `N p = N q`, this constructs `Ψ` between `s p` and `s q`, and then
  composing with the canonical inclusion we get `Φ`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/GromovHausdorff/Variantce374a2cf004786a7beefbfe911108cf11f44e39e7a4cc48f88a2714b933273d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
