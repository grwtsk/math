## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:96cfd4f9-910e-4037-b468-82828d3d3d93`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 767–952.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

section Complete

/- We will show that a sequence `u n` of compact metric spaces satisfying
`dist (u n) (u (n+1)) < 1/2^n` converges, which implies completeness of the Gromov-Hausdorff space.
We need to exhibit the limiting compact metric space. For this, start from
a sequence `X n` of representatives of `u n`, and glue in an optimal way `X n` to `X (n+1)`
for all `n`, in a common metric space. Formally, this is done as follows.
Start from `Y 0 = X 0`. Then, glue `X 0` to `X 1` in an optimal way, yielding a space
`Y 1` (with an embedding of `X 1`). Then, consider an optimal gluing of `X 1` and `X 2`, and
glue it to `Y 1` along their common subspace `X 1`. This gives a new space `Y 2`, with an
embedding of `X 2`. Go on, to obtain a sequence of spaces `Y n`. Let `Z0` be the inductive
limit of the `Y n`, and finally let `Z` be the completion of `Z0`.
The images `X2 n` of `X n` in `Z` are at Hausdorff distance `< 1/2^n` by construction, hence they
form a Cauchy sequence for the Hausdorff distance. By completeness (of `Z`, and therefore of its
set of nonempty compact subsets), they converge to a limit `L`. This is the nonempty
compact metric space we are looking for. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/GromovHausdorff/Variantdd049cdb4fc8103335d0832fc27a78577f265a363ce446977ce40dfd0efa4677.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.
