## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:28343b32-d1bc-441d-0772-26ed4615cf20`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 546–623.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  /- The proof goes as follows : the `GH_dist` is bounded by the Hausdorff distance of the images
    in the coupling, which is bounded (using the triangular inequality) by the sum of the Hausdorff
    distances of `X` and `s` (in the coupling or, equivalently in the original space), of `s` and
    `Φ s`, and of `Φ s` and `Y` (in the coupling or, equivalently, in the original space).
    The first term is bounded by `ε₁`, by `ε₁`-density. The third one is bounded by `ε₃`.
    And the middle one is bounded by `ε₂/2` as in the coupling the points `x` and `Φ x` are
    at distance `ε₂/2` by construction of the coupling (in fact `ε₂/2 + δ` where `δ` is an
    arbitrarily small positive constant where positivity is used to ensure that the coupling
    is really a metric space and not a premetric space on `X ⊕ Y`). -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/GromovHausdorff/Variant155c3fbe2b3a86bf4df400c13ca353c751317f9c9fc251ab3ebd53124cb5c3f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
