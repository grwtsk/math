## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bb2b0f7d2f171ad87bde9cd5a1e5e4bfc8264d7810c38b62c0feb43f08a5ec6d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 986–995.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (A : Type) [MetricSpace A] : Inhabited (AuxGluingStruct A) :=
  ⟨{  Space := A
      metric := by infer_instance
      embed := id
      -- porting note: without `by exact` there was an unsolved metavariable
      isom := fun x y => by exact rfl }⟩

/-- Auxiliary sequence of metric spaces, containing copies of `X 0`, ..., `X n`, where each
`X i` is glued to `X (i+1)` in an optimal way. The space at step `n+1` is obtained from the space
at step `n` by adding `X (n+1)`, glued in an optimal way to the `X n` already sitting there. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/MetricTopology/GromovHausdorff/Variantfe8ef45111aa39dad7e1cee065519e35a425e736b3064e9cd0957f3b37029c03.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/MetricTopology/GromovHausdorff/Variantfe8ef45111aa39dad7e1cee065519e35a425e736b3064e9cd0957f3b37029c03.lean#L986).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a323bb14830c522f7d8a6648634b1b5304b913ef` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
