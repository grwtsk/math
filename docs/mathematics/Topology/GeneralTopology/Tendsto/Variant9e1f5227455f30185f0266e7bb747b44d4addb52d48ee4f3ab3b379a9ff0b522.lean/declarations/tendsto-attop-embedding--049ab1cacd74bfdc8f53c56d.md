## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:982de254-5159-87a7-dc1a-987be71398db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 192–197.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_atTop_embedding [Preorder β] [Preorder γ] {f : α → β} {e : β → γ} {l : Filter α}
    (hm : ∀ b₁ b₂, e b₁ ≤ e b₂ ↔ b₁ ≤ b₂) (hu : ∀ c, ∃ b, c ≤ e b) :
    Tendsto (e ∘ f) l atTop ↔ Tendsto f l atTop := by
  rw [← comap_embedding_atTop hm hu, tendsto_comap_iff]

/-- A function `f` goes to `-∞` independent of an order-preserving embedding `e`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Tendsto/Variant9e1f5227455f30185f0266e7bb747b44d4addb52d48ee4f3ab3b379a9ff0b522.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Tendsto/Variant9e1f5227455f30185f0266e7bb747b44d4addb52d48ee4f3ab3b379a9ff0b522.lean#L192).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `15417f9e74d98eaced8a9a6abbafcd46158a9c8b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
