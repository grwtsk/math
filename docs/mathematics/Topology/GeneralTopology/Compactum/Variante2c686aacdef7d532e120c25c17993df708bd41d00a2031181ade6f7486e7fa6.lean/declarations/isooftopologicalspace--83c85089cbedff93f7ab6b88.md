## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8cbd75666f6785123cdc2904411f1ff43a653925cf3dfa5a83d2ccd1edf10014`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 439–455.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def isoOfTopologicalSpace {D : CompHaus} :
    compactumToCompHaus.obj (Compactum.ofTopologicalSpace D) ≅ D where
  hom := CompHausLike.ofHom _
    { toFun := id
      continuous_toFun :=
        continuous_def.2 fun _ h => by
          rw [isOpen_iff_ultrafilter'] at h
          exact h }
  inv := CompHausLike.ofHom _
    { toFun := id
      continuous_toFun :=
        continuous_def.2 fun _ h1 => by
          rw [isOpen_iff_ultrafilter']
          intro _ h2
          exact h1 _ h2 }

/-- The functor `compactumToCompHaus` is essentially surjective. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compactum/Variante2c686aacdef7d532e120c25c17993df708bd41d00a2031181ade6f7486e7fa6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compactum/Variante2c686aacdef7d532e120c25c17993df708bd41d00a2031181ade6f7486e7fa6.lean#L439).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2f797227f08c2d351198da1b4a65a9bbf5d2f0a4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
