## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:396b1ee4-99f3-2f11-3720-e95da23790e0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 306–312.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_of_liminf_eq_limsup {f : Filter β} {u : β → α} {a : α} (hinf : liminf u f = a)
    (hsup : limsup u f = a) (h : f.IsBoundedUnder (· ≤ ·) u := by isBoundedDefault)
    (h' : f.IsBoundedUnder (· ≥ ·) u := by isBoundedDefault) : Tendsto u f (𝓝 a) :=
  le_nhds_of_limsSup_eq_limsInf h h' hsup hinf

/-- If a number `a` is less than or equal to the `liminf` of a function `f` at some filter
and is greater than or equal to the `limsup` of `f`, then `f` tends to `a` along this filter. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LiminfLimsup/Variant3619d0051f2fb8c90a395401cb211497040c296df150b6966ed7ed6a11f04293.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LiminfLimsup/Variant3619d0051f2fb8c90a395401cb211497040c296df150b6966ed7ed6a11f04293.lean#L306).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5da351eb41598dd43a4bae3aa9e4342b4f16bf27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
