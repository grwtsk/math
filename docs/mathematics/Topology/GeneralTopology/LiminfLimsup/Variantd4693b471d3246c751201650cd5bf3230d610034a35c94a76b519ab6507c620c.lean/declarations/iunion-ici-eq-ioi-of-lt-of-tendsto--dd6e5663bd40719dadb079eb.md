## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f0e75c32-01c2-bccf-81b9-2112c9fe862a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 460–473.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem iUnion_Ici_eq_Ioi_of_lt_of_tendsto {ι : Type*} (x : R) {as : ι → R} (x_lt : ∀ i, x < as i)
    {F : Filter ι} [Filter.NeBot F] (as_lim : Filter.Tendsto as F (𝓝 x)) :
    ⋃ i : ι, Ici (as i) = Ioi x := by
  have obs : x ∉ range as := by
    intro maybe_x_is
    rcases mem_range.mp maybe_x_is with ⟨i, hi⟩
    simpa only [hi, lt_self_iff_false] using x_lt i
  -- Porting note: `rw at *` was too destructive. Let's only rewrite `obs` and the goal.
  have := iInf_eq_of_forall_le_of_tendsto (fun i ↦ (x_lt i).le) as_lim
  rw [← this] at obs
  rw [← this]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LiminfLimsup/Variantd4693b471d3246c751201650cd5bf3230d610034a35c94a76b519ab6507c620c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LiminfLimsup/Variantd4693b471d3246c751201650cd5bf3230d610034a35c94a76b519ab6507c620c.lean#L460).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b74ea00a047a9c4ce5e8ec4f3d6afd4fd6b5c4a8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
