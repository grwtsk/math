## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ae34e6ab-dd7d-f2d9-11b7-57e0680dec99`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 290–298.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsProperMap.universally_closed (Z) [TopologicalSpace Z] (h : IsProperMap f) :
    IsClosedMap (Prod.map f id : X × Z → Y × Z) :=
  -- `f × id` is proper as a product of proper maps, hence closed.
  (h.prod_map isProperMap_id).isClosedMap

/-- A map `f : X → Y` is proper if and only if it is continuous and the map
`(Prod.map f id : X × Filter X → Y × Filter X)` is closed. This is stronger than
`isProperMap_iff_universally_closed` since it shows that there's only one space to check to get
properness, but in most cases it doesn't matter. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ProperMap/Variant442b1bf0528d82778a139baeed317b4929a43461ef51be70f8a81242d0c16fb1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ProperMap/Variant442b1bf0528d82778a139baeed317b4929a43461ef51be70f8a81242d0c16fb1.lean#L290).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `28e43acb0c67a5ecf427f1a5ea49d13338f4b310` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
