## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:41e666a4-0957-38eb-bcce-677a18890a5d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 213–240.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem isProperMap_iff_isClosedMap_and_compact_fibers :
    IsProperMap f ↔ Continuous f ∧ IsClosedMap f ∧ ∀ y, IsCompact (f ⁻¹' {y}) := by
  constructor <;> intro H
  -- Note: In Bourbaki, the direct implication is proved by going through universally closed maps.
  -- We could do the same (using a `TFAE` cycle) but proving it directly from
  -- `IsProperMap.isCompact_preimage` is nice enough already so we don't bother with that.
  · exact ⟨H.continuous, H.isClosedMap, fun y ↦ H.isCompact_preimage isCompact_singleton⟩
  · rw [isProperMap_iff_clusterPt]
  -- Let `ℱ : Filter X` and `y` some cluster point of `map f ℱ`.
    refine ⟨H.1, fun ℱ y hy ↦ ?_⟩
  -- That means that the singleton `pure y` meets the "closure" of `map f ℱ`, by which we mean
  -- `Filter.lift' (map f ℱ) closure`. But `f` is closed, so
  -- `closure (map f ℱ) = map f (closure ℱ)` (see `IsClosedMap.lift'_closure_map_eq`).
  -- Thus `map f (closure ℱ ⊓ 𝓟 (f ⁻¹' {y})) = map f (closure ℱ) ⊓ 𝓟 {y} ≠ ⊥`, hence
  -- `closure ℱ ⊓ 𝓟 (f ⁻¹' {y}) ≠ ⊥`.
    rw [H.2.1.mapClusterPt_iff_lift'_closure H.1] at hy
  -- Now, applying the compactness of `f ⁻¹' {y}` to the nontrivial filter
  -- `closure ℱ ⊓ 𝓟 (f ⁻¹' {y})`, we obtain that it has a cluster point `x ∈ f ⁻¹' {y}`.
    rcases H.2.2 y (f := Filter.lift' ℱ closure ⊓ 𝓟 (f ⁻¹' {y})) inf_le_right with ⟨x, hxy, hx⟩
    refine ⟨x, hxy, ?_⟩
  -- In particular `x` is a cluster point of `closure ℱ`. Since cluster points of `closure ℱ`
  -- are exactly cluster points of `ℱ` (see `clusterPt_lift'_closure_iff`), this completes
  -- the proof.

`cocompact`. Only works when the codomain is `T1`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ProperMap/Variant442b1bf0528d82778a139baeed317b4929a43461ef51be70f8a81242d0c16fb1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ProperMap/Variant442b1bf0528d82778a139baeed317b4929a43461ef51be70f8a81242d0c16fb1.lean#L213).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
