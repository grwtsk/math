## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d7da93c1-757c-1346-5db7-7cb5247a451b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_const_mul_pow_atTop_iff :
    Tendsto (fun x => c * x ^ n) atTop atTop ↔ n ≠ 0 ∧ 0 < c := by
  refine ⟨fun h => ⟨?_, ?_⟩, fun h => tendsto_const_mul_pow_atTop h.1 h.2⟩
  · rintro rfl
    simp only [pow_zero, not_tendsto_const_atTop] at h
  · rcases ((h.eventually_gt_atTop 0).and (eventually_ge_atTop 0)).exists with ⟨k, hck, hk⟩
    exact pos_of_mul_pos_left hck (pow_nonneg hk _)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Field/Variant02f32198186454d2053124162d4a6c924207a5fa7f3c1c861d14d67a66bdc83c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Field/Variant02f32198186454d2053124162d4a6c924207a5fa7f3c1c861d14d67a66bdc83c.lean#L97).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `60ab5abb8dd93a16e1a6aaec717a1b452e14d83c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
