## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6aa97c1e8c28ad763e17176f8b97b87bc97c8b8e7797b8b7c642924935ace7ff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Nonneg.unitsHomeomorphPos (R : Type*) [DivisionSemiring R] [PartialOrder R]

    [TopologicalSpace R] [ContinuousInv₀ R] :
    (Nonneg R)ˣ ≃ₜ { r : R // 0 < r } where

section affineHomeomorph

/-!
This section is about affine homeomorphisms from a topological field `𝕜` to itself.
Technically it does not require `𝕜` to be a topological field, a topological ring that
happens to be a field is enough.
-/


variable {𝕜 : Type*} [Field 𝕜] [TopologicalSpace 𝕜] [IsTopologicalRing 𝕜]

/--
The map `fun x => a * x + b`, as a homeomorphism from `𝕜` (a topological field) to itself,
when `a ≠ 0`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Field/Variant52e5996f0731108d6937467f80e9ae18dc2ecb6c95e9db981f4d40ec7918c0f8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Field/Variant52e5996f0731108d6937467f80e9ae18dc2ecb6c95e9db981f4d40ec7918c0f8.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bd4ab79bbe279f73202d08c8d0e0c03b4e6eda9e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
