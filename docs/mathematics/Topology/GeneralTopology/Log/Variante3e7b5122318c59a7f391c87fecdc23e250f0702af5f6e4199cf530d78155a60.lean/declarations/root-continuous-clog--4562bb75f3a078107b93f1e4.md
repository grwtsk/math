## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5a7bd76a-dcaa-d3b6-ef52-d6386d6eea21`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 281–296.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (h₂ : ∀ x, f x ∈ slitPlane) : Continuous fun t => log (f t) :=
  continuous_iff_continuousAt.2 fun x => h₁.continuousAt.clog (h₂ x)

end LogDeriv

/-- `Complex.exp` as an `OpenPartialHomeomorph` with `source = {z | -π < im z < π}` and
`target = {z | 0 < re z} ∪ {z | im z ≠ 0}` (a.k.a. `slitPlane`).
This definition is used to prove that `Complex.log`
is complex differentiable at all points but the negative real semi-axis.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Log/Variante3e7b5122318c59a7f391c87fecdc23e250f0702af5f6e4199cf530d78155a60.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Log/Variante3e7b5122318c59a7f391c87fecdc23e250f0702af5f6e4199cf530d78155a60.lean#L281).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7d9d13f0fff6011a6cb81847fcf67c3014900835` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
