## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8e9ce8bd-a059-5e62-3407-8388b1791b46`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 269–279.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Embedding.discreteTopology {X Y : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [tY : TopologicalSpace Y]
    [DiscreteTopology Y] {f : X → Y} (hf : Embedding f) : DiscreteTopology X :=
  discreteTopology_iff_nhds.2 fun x => by
    rw [hf.nhds_eq_comap, nhds_discrete, comap_pure, ← image_singleton, hf.inj.preimage_image,
      principal_singleton]
#align embedding.discrete_topology Embedding.discreteTopology

end Embedding

/-- A function between topological spaces is a quotient map if it is surjective,
  and for all `s : Set β`, `s` is open iff its preimage is an open set. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Maps/Variant05ab4a70e7820efed285337524d545a2e6a4e0b00287939e762917780badcad2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Maps/Variant05ab4a70e7820efed285337524d545a2e6a4e0b00287939e762917780badcad2.lean#L269).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `16ef61fdbc82e0cccc1bb43c7f207f5e3f53d2bd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
