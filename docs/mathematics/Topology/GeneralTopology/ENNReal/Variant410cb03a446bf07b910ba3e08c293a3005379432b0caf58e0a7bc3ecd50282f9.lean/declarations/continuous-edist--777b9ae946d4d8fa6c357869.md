## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ccd867eb-30ae-fbfc-79b0-45ac14e1e7b0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1462–1473.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem continuous_edist : Continuous fun p : α × α => edist p.1 p.2 := by
  apply continuous_of_le_add_edist 2 (by norm_num)
  rintro ⟨x, y⟩ ⟨x', y'⟩
  calc
    edist x y ≤ edist x x' + edist x' y' + edist y' y := edist_triangle4 _ _ _ _
    _ = edist x' y' + (edist x x' + edist y y') := by simp only [edist_comm]; ac_rfl
    _ ≤ edist x' y' + (edist (x, y) (x', y') + edist (x, y) (x', y')) :=
      (add_le_add_left (add_le_add (le_max_left _ _) (le_max_right _ _)) _)
    _ = edist x' y' + 2 * edist (x, y) (x', y') := by rw [← mul_two, mul_comm]
#align continuous_edist continuous_edist

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ENNReal/Variant410cb03a446bf07b910ba3e08c293a3005379432b0caf58e0a7bc3ecd50282f9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ENNReal/Variant410cb03a446bf07b910ba3e08c293a3005379432b0caf58e0a7bc3ecd50282f9.lean#L1462).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fc556a2f6999b6b174e20b623d4cd1bc49508f65` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
