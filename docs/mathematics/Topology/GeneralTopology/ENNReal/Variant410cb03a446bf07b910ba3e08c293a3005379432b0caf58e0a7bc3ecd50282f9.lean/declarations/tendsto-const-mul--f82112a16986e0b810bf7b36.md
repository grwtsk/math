## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:58939d65-db5b-a575-a337-1c266d039d17`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 381–386.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem Tendsto.const_mul {f : Filter α} {m : α → ℝ≥0∞} {a b : ℝ≥0∞}
    (hm : Tendsto m f (𝓝 b)) (hb : b ≠ 0 ∨ a ≠ ⊤) : Tendsto (fun b => a * m b) f (𝓝 (a * b)) :=
  by_cases (fun (this : a = 0) => by simp [this, tendsto_const_nhds]) fun ha : a ≠ 0 =>
    ENNReal.Tendsto.mul tendsto_const_nhds (Or.inl ha) hm hb
#align ennreal.tendsto.const_mul ENNReal.Tendsto.const_mul

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ENNReal/Variant410cb03a446bf07b910ba3e08c293a3005379432b0caf58e0a7bc3ecd50282f9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ENNReal/Variant410cb03a446bf07b910ba3e08c293a3005379432b0caf58e0a7bc3ecd50282f9.lean#L381).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fc556a2f6999b6b174e20b623d4cd1bc49508f65` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
