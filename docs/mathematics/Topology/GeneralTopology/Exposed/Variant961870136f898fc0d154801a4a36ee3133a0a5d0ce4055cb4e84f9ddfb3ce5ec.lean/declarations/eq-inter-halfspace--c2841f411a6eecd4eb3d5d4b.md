## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0b99de74-ef8d-d068-73c6-e5b3e1f46a6c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_inter_halfSpace' {A B : Set E} (hAB : IsExposed 𝕜 A B) (hB : B.Nonempty) :
    ∃ l : E →L[𝕜] 𝕜, ∃ a, B = { x ∈ A | a ≤ l x } := by
  obtain ⟨l, rfl⟩ := hAB hB
  obtain ⟨w, hw⟩ := hB
  exact ⟨l, l w, Subset.antisymm (fun x hx => ⟨hx.1, hx.2 w hw.1⟩) fun x hx =>
    ⟨hx.1, fun y hy => (hw.2 y hy).trans hx.2⟩⟩
@[deprecated (since := "2024-11-12")] alias eq_inter_halfspace' := eq_inter_halfSpace'

/-- For nontrivial `𝕜`, if `B` is an exposed subset of `A`, then `B` is the intersection of `A` with
some closed half-space. The converse is *not* true. It would require that the corresponding open
half-space doesn't intersect `A`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Exposed/Variant961870136f898fc0d154801a4a36ee3133a0a5d0ce4055cb4e84f9ddfb3ce5ec.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Exposed/Variant961870136f898fc0d154801a4a36ee3133a0a5d0ce4055cb4e84f9ddfb3ce5ec.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `015e3a41f25ae35d8cf8ba0ddceb5e0e0a27833e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
