## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:64aa794f8fa90920a40014a028ecced58c1868dbc779b6193d85e1a577501d34`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 84–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def coinduced (f : X → Y) (t : TopologicalSpace X) : TopologicalSpace Y where
  IsOpen s := IsOpen (f ⁻¹' s)
  isOpen_univ := t.isOpen_univ
  isOpen_inter _ _ h₁ h₂ := h₁.inter h₂
  isOpen_sUnion s h := by simpa only [preimage_sUnion] using isOpen_biUnion h

end TopologicalSpace

namespace Topology
variable {X Y : Type*} [tX : TopologicalSpace X] [tY : TopologicalSpace Y]

/-- We say that restrictions of the topology on `X` to sets from a family `S`
generates the original topology,
if either of the following equivalent conditions hold:

- a set which is relatively open in each `s ∈ S` is open;
- a set which is relatively closed in each `s ∈ S` is closed;
- for any topological space `Y`, a function `f : X → Y` is continuous
  provided that it is continuous on each `s ∈ S`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Induced/Variant5c9beec258b727d7a1f4e94d8ca7a66d737669d49c701aa5068f4c0491735cce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Induced/Variant5c9beec258b727d7a1f4e94d8ca7a66d737669d49c701aa5068f4c0491735cce.lean#L84).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `be561ceadc28b663fcaf5103e172ff8fcc113998` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
