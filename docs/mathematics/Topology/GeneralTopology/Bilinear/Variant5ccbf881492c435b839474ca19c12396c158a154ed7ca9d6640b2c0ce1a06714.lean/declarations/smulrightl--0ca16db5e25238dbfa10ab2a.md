## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2ca1db33c5ab5b99e7e1637203348a8cbabcb76aa5e41a0616e70fb91d92fdd3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 427–454.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def smulRightL : StrongDual 𝕜 E →L[𝕜] Fₗ →L[𝕜] E →L[𝕜] Fₗ :=
  LinearMap.mkContinuous₂
    { toFun := smulRightₗ
      map_add' := fun c₁ c₂ => by
        ext x
        simp only [add_smul, coe_smulRightₗ, add_apply, smulRight_apply, LinearMap.add_apply]
      map_smul' := fun m c => by
        ext x
        simp [smul_smul] }
    1 fun c x => by
      simp only [coe_smulRightₗ, one_mul, norm_smulRight_apply, LinearMap.coe_mk, AddHom.coe_mk,
        le_refl]

end ContinuousLinearMap

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bilinear/Variant5ccbf881492c435b839474ca19c12396c158a154ed7ca9d6640b2c0ce1a06714.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bilinear/Variant5ccbf881492c435b839474ca19c12396c158a154ed7ca9d6640b2c0ce1a06714.lean#L427).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cc464034a7b100c1be55d38a066dd05a4d50187a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
