## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:685510c9-d150-2aec-7320-574b2276abdf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 376–382.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma bilinearComp_zero_right {f : E →SL[σ₁₃] F →SL[σ₂₃] G} {gE : E' →SL[σ₁'] E} :
    bilinearComp f gE (0 : F' →SL[σ₂'] F) = 0 := by ext; simp

variable [RingHomIsometric σ₁₃] [RingHomIsometric σ₁'] [RingHomIsometric σ₂']

/-- Derivative of a continuous bilinear map `f : E →L[𝕜] F →L[𝕜] G` interpreted as a map `E × F → G`
at point `p : E × F` evaluated at `q : E × F`, as a continuous bilinear map. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bilinear/Variant9dda236086cee0a4e3dd0fed23a88c8cc969cc03098266db1b7b2b25ffeefa32.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bilinear/Variant9dda236086cee0a4e3dd0fed23a88c8cc969cc03098266db1b7b2b25ffeefa32.lean#L376).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e29af5a9f1c2503b635ae247b0a71851e4db60eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
