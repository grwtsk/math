## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2af4c6e2-f947-ab8e-cd19-de44742459f7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 152–157.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem get_bijective_iff [BEq α] [LawfulBEq α] : l.get.Bijective ↔ ∀ a, l.count a = 1 :=
  ⟨fun h a ↦ (nodup_iff_count_eq_one.mp <| nodup_iff_injective_get.mpr h.injective)
    a <| mem_iff_get.mpr <| h.surjective a,
  fun h ↦ ⟨nodup_iff_injective_get.mp <| nodup_iff_count_eq_one.mpr fun a _ ↦ h a,
    fun a ↦ mem_iff_get.mp <| List.one_le_count_iff.mp <| by grind⟩⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Nodup/Variant21a4796b07978fa6fc3e103225181cc02b5794cb838fe5e3e2d598538d007b18.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Nodup/Variant21a4796b07978fa6fc3e103225181cc02b5794cb838fe5e3e2d598538d007b18.lean#L152).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `09e4cfc6cb3bbf32e7adc01457da554a8e69a912` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
