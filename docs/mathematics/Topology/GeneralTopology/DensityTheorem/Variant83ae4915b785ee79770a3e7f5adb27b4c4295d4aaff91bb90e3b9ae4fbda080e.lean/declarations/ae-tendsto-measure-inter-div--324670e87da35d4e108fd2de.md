## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:90c3bd21-28ce-b392-ea0b-a01091a395a2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 149–157.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    ∀ {ι : Type*} {l : Filter ι} (w : ι → α) (δ : ι → ℝ) (_ : Tendsto δ l (𝓝[>] 0))
      (_ : ∀ᶠ j in l, x ∈ closedBall (w j) (K * δ j)),
      Tendsto (fun j => μ (S ∩ closedBall (w j) (δ j)) / μ (closedBall (w j) (δ j))) l (𝓝 1) := by

    xmem using hx.comp (tendsto_closedBall_filterAt μ _ _ δlim xmem)

/-- A version of **Lebesgue differentiation theorem** for a sequence of closed balls whose
centers are not required to be fixed. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/DensityTheorem/Variant83ae4915b785ee79770a3e7f5adb27b4c4295d4aaff91bb90e3b9ae4fbda080e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/DensityTheorem/Variant83ae4915b785ee79770a3e7f5adb27b4c4295d4aaff91bb90e3b9ae4fbda080e.lean#L149).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fdf41eeb408b3ab40d6ebbb34f32fb81b0865918` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
