## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1a5cc295-587a-41e6-3f27-2e22d6f5f2cf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 119–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma ContinuousAt.inner_bundle
    (hv : ContinuousAt (fun m ↦ (v m : TotalSpace F E)) x)
    (hw : ContinuousAt (fun m ↦ (w m : TotalSpace F E)) x) :
    ContinuousAt (fun b ↦ ⟪v b, w b⟫) x := by
  simp only [← continuousWithinAt_univ] at hv hw ⊢
  exact ContinuousWithinAt.inner_bundle hv hw

/-- Given two continuous maps into the same fibers of a continuous Riemannian bundle,
their inner product is continuous. Version with `ContinuousOn`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Riemannian/Variant86ac312ced480bcd7d54bed0623fa2b77aeeb375ac67e5e55b759af428d0bb98.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Riemannian/Variant86ac312ced480bcd7d54bed0623fa2b77aeeb375ac67e5e55b759af428d0bb98.lean#L119).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1846c1475dfe7bb95a80b4497bdd70622b7f61bd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
