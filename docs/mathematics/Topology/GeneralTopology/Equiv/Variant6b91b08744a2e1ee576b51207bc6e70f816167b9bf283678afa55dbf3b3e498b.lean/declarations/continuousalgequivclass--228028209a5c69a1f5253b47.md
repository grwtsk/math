## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a7659ce1fa727e2264fd13886eaa337eaba6334fe5003acacd0e9f2a58688273`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 67–81.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class ContinuousAlgEquivClass (F : Type*) (R A B : outParam Type*) [CommSemiring R]
    [Semiring A] [TopologicalSpace A] [Semiring B] [TopologicalSpace B]
    [Algebra R A] [Algebra R B] [EquivLike F A B] : Prop
    extends AlgEquivClass F R A B, HomeomorphClass F A B

namespace ContinuousAlgEquiv

variable {R A B C : Type*}
  [CommSemiring R] [Semiring A] [TopologicalSpace A] [Semiring B]
  [TopologicalSpace B] [Semiring C] [TopologicalSpace C] [Algebra R A] [Algebra R B]
  [Algebra R C]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Equiv/Variant6b91b08744a2e1ee576b51207bc6e70f816167b9bf283678afa55dbf3b3e498b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Equiv/Variant6b91b08744a2e1ee576b51207bc6e70f816167b9bf283678afa55dbf3b3e498b.lean#L67).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5cf332f4b238b22289008f48aa07d027c1a69cab` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
