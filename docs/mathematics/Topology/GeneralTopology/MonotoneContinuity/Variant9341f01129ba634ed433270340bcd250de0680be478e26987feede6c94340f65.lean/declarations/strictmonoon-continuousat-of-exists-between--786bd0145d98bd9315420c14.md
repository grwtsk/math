## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4cbe21b5-87c3-8760-41a8-804d9a99ecfd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 203–212.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem StrictMonoOn.continuousAt_of_exists_between {f : α → β} {s : Set α} {a : α}
    (h_mono : StrictMonoOn f s) (hs : s ∈ 𝓝 a) (hfs_l : ∀ b < f a, ∃ c ∈ s, f c ∈ Ico b (f a))
    (hfs_r : ∀ b > f a, ∃ c ∈ s, f c ∈ Ioc (f a) b) : ContinuousAt f a :=
  continuousAt_iff_continuous_left_right.2
    ⟨h_mono.continuousWithinAt_left_of_exists_between (mem_nhdsWithin_of_mem_nhds hs) hfs_l,
      h_mono.continuousWithinAt_right_of_exists_between (mem_nhdsWithin_of_mem_nhds hs) hfs_r⟩

/-- If a function `f` with a densely ordered codomain is strictly monotone on a neighborhood of `a`
and the closure of the image of this neighborhood under `f` is a neighborhood of `f a`, then `f` is
continuous at `a`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/MonotoneContinuity/Variant9341f01129ba634ed433270340bcd250de0680be478e26987feede6c94340f65.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/MonotoneContinuity/Variant9341f01129ba634ed433270340bcd250de0680be478e26987feede6c94340f65.lean#L203).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8d097ce1780426d37676af161e9b7f16bd0db45f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
