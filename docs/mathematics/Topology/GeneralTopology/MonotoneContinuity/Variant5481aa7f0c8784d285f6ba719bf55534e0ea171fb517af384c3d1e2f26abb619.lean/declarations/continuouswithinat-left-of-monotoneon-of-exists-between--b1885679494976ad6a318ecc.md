## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a4be1f0e-30f3-6046-a1be-0c510f354a75`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 162–173.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem continuousWithinAt_left_of_monotoneOn_of_exists_between {f : α → β} {s : Set α} {a : α}
    (hf : MonotoneOn f s) (hs : s ∈ 𝓝[≤] a) (hfs : ∀ b < f a, ∃ c ∈ s, f c ∈ Ioo b (f a)) :
    ContinuousWithinAt f (Iic a) a :=

    fun b hb =>
    let ⟨c, hcs, hcb, hca⟩ := hfs b hb
    ⟨c, hcs, hca, hcb⟩
#align continuous_at_left_of_monotone_on_of_exists_between continuousWithinAt_left_of_monotoneOn_of_exists_between

/-- If a function `f` with a densely ordered codomain is monotone on a left neighborhood of `a` and
the closure of the image of this neighborhood under `f` is a left neighborhood of `f a`, then `f` is
continuous at `a` from the left -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/MonotoneContinuity/Variant5481aa7f0c8784d285f6ba719bf55534e0ea171fb517af384c3d1e2f26abb619.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/MonotoneContinuity/Variant5481aa7f0c8784d285f6ba719bf55534e0ea171fb517af384c3d1e2f26abb619.lean#L162).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `73d4df1f1c1aea4e7d1a68ddcf606b5c821777ee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
