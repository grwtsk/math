## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2791c9e9-c5d1-c494-ffbf-a27d5ba3c8da`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 188–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem StrictMonoOn.continuousWithinAt_left_of_surjOn {f : α → β} {s : Set α} {a : α}
    (h_mono : StrictMonoOn f s) (hs : s ∈ 𝓝[≤] a) (hfs : SurjOn f s (Iio (f a))) :
    ContinuousWithinAt f (Iic a) a :=
  h_mono.dual.continuousWithinAt_right_of_surjOn hs hfs

/-- If a function `f` is strictly monotone on a neighborhood of `a` and the image of this
neighborhood under `f` meets every interval `[b, f a)`, `b < f a`, and every interval
`(f a, b]`, `b > f a`, then `f` is continuous at `a`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/MonotoneContinuity/Variantb4364197a95b028eca4832996f921caaeb5d312f7e7fd3f83569220195e13a40.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/MonotoneContinuity/Variantb4364197a95b028eca4832996f921caaeb5d312f7e7fd3f83569220195e13a40.lean#L188).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f26fcdf43df039cd60336608ee88b05cf273ec78` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
