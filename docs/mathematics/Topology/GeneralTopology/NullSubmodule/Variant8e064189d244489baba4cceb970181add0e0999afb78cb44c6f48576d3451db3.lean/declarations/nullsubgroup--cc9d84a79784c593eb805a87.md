## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:96c8246a70ea6911f80c786ed2cf685134ec430b9439514e23e1a9316fdfabc3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 34–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def nullSubgroup : Subgroup M where
  carrier := {x : M | ‖x‖ = 0}
  mul_mem' {x y} (hx : ‖x‖ = 0) (hy : ‖y‖ = 0) := by
    apply le_antisymm _ (norm_nonneg' _)
    refine (norm_mul_le' x y).trans_eq ?_
    rw [hx, hy, add_zero]
  one_mem' := norm_one'
  inv_mem' {x} (hx : ‖x‖ = 0) := by simpa only [Set.mem_setOf_eq, norm_inv'] using hx

@[to_additive]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/NullSubmodule/Variant8e064189d244489baba4cceb970181add0e0999afb78cb44c6f48576d3451db3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/NullSubmodule/Variant8e064189d244489baba4cceb970181add0e0999afb78cb44c6f48576d3451db3.lean#L34).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ebeae2cf9db4fa02b298831fd206b0799ed357de` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
