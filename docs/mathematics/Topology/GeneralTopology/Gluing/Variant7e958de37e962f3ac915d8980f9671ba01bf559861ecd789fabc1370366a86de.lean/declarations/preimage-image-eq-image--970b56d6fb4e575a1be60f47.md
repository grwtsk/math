## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7dcf84c9-df17-63f8-32b3-ceda4f28922b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 300–318.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem preimage_image_eq_image' (i j : D.J) (U : Set (𝖣.U i)) :
    𝖣.ι j ⁻¹' (𝖣.ι i '' U) = (D.t i j ≫ D.f _ _) '' (D.f _ _ ⁻¹' U) := by
  convert D.preimage_image_eq_image i j U using 1
  rw [coe_comp, coe_comp]
  -- porting note: `show` was not needed, since `rw [← Set.image_image]` worked.
  show (fun x => ((forget TopCat).map _ ((forget TopCat).map _ x))) '' _ = _
  rw [← Set.image_image]
  -- porting note: `congr 1` was here, instead of `congr_arg`, however, it did nothing.
  refine congr_arg ?_ ?_
  rw [← Set.eq_preimage_iff_image_eq, Set.preimage_preimage]
  change _ = (D.t i j ≫ D.t j i ≫ _) ⁻¹' _
  rw [𝖣.t_inv_assoc]
  rw [← isIso_iff_bijective]
  apply (forget TopCat).map_isIso
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false in
#align Top.glue_data.preimage_image_eq_image' TopCat.GlueData.preimage_image_eq_image'

-- porting note: the goal was simply `IsOpen (𝖣.ι i '' U)`.
-- I had to manually add the explicit type ascription.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Gluing/Variant7e958de37e962f3ac915d8980f9671ba01bf559861ecd789fabc1370366a86de.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Gluing/Variant7e958de37e962f3ac915d8980f9671ba01bf559861ecd789fabc1370366a86de.lean#L300).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `802ab5a48fc2bafc2785400233ac230009dd09c4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
