## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7bb14ca86ff1f7c0033e081a81f75e5911479f2f3467b6683ef27110744a4b15`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 451–458.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def fromOpenSubsetsGlue : (ofOpenSubsets U).toGlueData.glued ⟶ TopCat.of α :=
  Multicoequalizer.desc _ _ (fun x => Opens.inclusion _) (by rintro ⟨i, j⟩; ext x; rfl)
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false in
#align Top.glue_data.from_open_subsets_glue TopCat.GlueData.fromOpenSubsetsGlue

-- Porting note: `elementwise` here produces a bad lemma,
-- where too much has been simplified, despite the `nosimp`.
@[simp, elementwise nosimp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Gluing/Variant0920053b4b33752634652d247aa6be20b987fa2ea1bb8fad432023ea12af8432.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Gluing/Variant0920053b4b33752634652d247aa6be20b987fa2ea1bb8fad432023ea12af8432.lean#L451).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `694923143d2ddbfb88963488273fd033f2782247` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
