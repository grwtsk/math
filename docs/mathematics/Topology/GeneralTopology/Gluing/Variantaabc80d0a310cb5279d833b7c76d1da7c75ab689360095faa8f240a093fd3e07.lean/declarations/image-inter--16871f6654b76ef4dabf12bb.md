## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7be30f9d-6375-2997-5195-b19d50828ab9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 227–239.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem image_inter (i j : D.J) :
    Set.range (𝖣.ι i) ∩ Set.range (𝖣.ι j) = Set.range (D.f i j ≫ 𝖣.ι _) := by
  ext x
  constructor
  · rintro ⟨⟨x₁, eq₁⟩, ⟨x₂, eq₂⟩⟩
    obtain ⟨y, e₁, -⟩ := (D.ι_eq_iff_rel _ _ _ _).mp (eq₁.trans eq₂.symm)
    · substs eq₁
      exact ⟨y, by simp [e₁]⟩
  · rintro ⟨x, hx⟩
    refine ⟨⟨D.f i j x, hx⟩, ⟨D.f j i (D.t _ _ x), ?_⟩⟩
    rw [D.glue_condition_apply]
    exact hx

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Gluing/Variantaabc80d0a310cb5279d833b7c76d1da7c75ab689360095faa8f240a093fd3e07.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Gluing/Variantaabc80d0a310cb5279d833b7c76d1da7c75ab689360095faa8f240a093fd3e07.lean#L227).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7d742846b153613845bea1363bff216a2232062f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
