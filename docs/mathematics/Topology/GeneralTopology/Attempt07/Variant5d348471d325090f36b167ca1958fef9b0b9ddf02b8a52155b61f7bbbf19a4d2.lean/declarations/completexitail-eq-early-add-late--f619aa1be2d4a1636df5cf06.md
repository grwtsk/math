## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d3876888-1d17-2a78-974d-2018b6d3c20a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 182–192.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem completeXiTail_eq_early_add_late {A : ℝ} (hA : 91 ≤ A) :
    completeXiTail A = actualXiEarlyReturnedWork A + actualXiLateReturnedWork A := by
  have hord := actualXiEarlyReturned_split_orders hA
  have hi := actualXiReturnedWork_intervalIntegrable hA (hord.1.trans hord.2)
  have hi1 := actualXiReturnedWork_intervalIntegrable hA hord.1
  have hi2 := hi1.symm.trans hi
  rw [completeXiTail_eq_damped_primitive_return hA]
  unfold actualXiEarlyReturnedWork actualXiLateReturnedWork
  exact (intervalIntegral.integral_add_adjacent_intervals hi1 hi2).symm

/-- The checked early budget vanishes on the original real scale domain. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Attempt07/Variant5d348471d325090f36b167ca1958fef9b0b9ddf02b8a52155b61f7bbbf19a4d2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Attempt07/Variant5d348471d325090f36b167ca1958fef9b0b9ddf02b8a52155b61f7bbbf19a4d2.lean#L182).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3c75302c6e943ff6ba06cd7ac354cfd49c921370` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
