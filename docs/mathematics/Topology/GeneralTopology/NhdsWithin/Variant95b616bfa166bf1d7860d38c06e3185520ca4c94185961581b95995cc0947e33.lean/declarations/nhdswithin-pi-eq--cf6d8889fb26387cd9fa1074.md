## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a0423526-73ec-8f36-32f8-8e4e707045af`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 347–355.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nhdsWithin_pi_eq {I : Set ι} (hI : I.Finite) (s : ∀ i, Set (X i)) (x : ∀ i, X i) :
    𝓝[pi I s] x =
      (⨅ i ∈ I, comap (fun x => x i) (𝓝[s i] x i)) ⊓
        ⨅ (i) (_ : i ∉ I), comap (fun x => x i) (𝓝 (x i)) := by
  simp only [nhdsWithin, nhds_pi, Filter.pi, pi_def, ← iInf_principal_finite hI, comap_inf,
    comap_principal]
  rw [iInf_split _ fun i => i ∈ I, inf_right_comm]
  simp only [iInf_inf_eq]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/NhdsWithin/Variant95b616bfa166bf1d7860d38c06e3185520ca4c94185961581b95995cc0947e33.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/NhdsWithin/Variant95b616bfa166bf1d7860d38c06e3185520ca4c94185961581b95995cc0947e33.lean#L347).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b562cfb3898fd3638a705f73eccde11a69ca0783` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
