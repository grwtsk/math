## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d49a65d9-514c-15a5-d520-da5fb9829a42`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 431–434.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_closure_pi {ι : Type*} {α : ι → Type*} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (α i)] {I : Set ι}
    {s : ∀ i, Set (α i)} {x : ∀ i, α i} : x ∈ closure (pi I s) ↔ ∀ i ∈ I, x i ∈ closure (s i) := by
  simp only [mem_closure_iff_nhdsWithin_neBot, nhdsWithin_pi_neBot]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/NhdsWithin/Variant95b616bfa166bf1d7860d38c06e3185520ca4c94185961581b95995cc0947e33.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/NhdsWithin/Variant95b616bfa166bf1d7860d38c06e3185520ca4c94185961581b95995cc0947e33.lean#L431).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b562cfb3898fd3638a705f73eccde11a69ca0783` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
