## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:45c824b0-df60-1cb5-b7d9-dcb1458f15a7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 810–820.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma map_eq_zero_of_norm_zero (q : Seminorm 𝕜 F)
    (hq : Continuous q) {x : F} (hx : ‖x‖ = 0) : q x = 0 :=
  (map_zero q) ▸
    ((specializes_iff_mem_closure.mpr $ mem_closure_zero_iff_norm.mpr hx).map hq).eq.symm

/-- Let `F` be a semi-`NormedSpace` over a `NontriviallyNormedField`, and let `q` be a
seminorm on `F`. If `q` is continuous, then it is uniformly controlled by the norm, that is there
is some `C > 0` such that `∀ x, q x ≤ C * ‖x‖`.
The continuity ensures boundedness on a ball of some radius `ε`. The nontriviality of the
norm is then used to rescale any element into an element of norm in `[ε/C, ε[`, thus with a
controlled image by `q`. The control of `q` at the original element follows by rescaling. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/WithSeminorms/Variantda67d0a845e8ba4880227d6d45be19e592b7a057a13b66e846a6d5d616e4368e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/WithSeminorms/Variantda67d0a845e8ba4880227d6d45be19e592b7a057a13b66e846a6d5d616e4368e.lean#L810).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ba56343cf89d6a690c97c79be18555888ac929ac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
