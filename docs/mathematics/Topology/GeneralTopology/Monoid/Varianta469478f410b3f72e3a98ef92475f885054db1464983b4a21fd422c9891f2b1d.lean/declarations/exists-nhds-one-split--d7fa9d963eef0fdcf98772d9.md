## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8296f747-6003-91a1-f9a0-dbbcc19f28d0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 592–600.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_nhds_one_split {s : Set M} (hs : s ∈ 𝓝 (1 : M)) :
    ∃ V ∈ 𝓝 (1 : M), ∀ v ∈ V, ∀ w ∈ V, v * w ∈ s :=
  let ⟨V, Vo, V1, hV⟩ := exists_open_nhds_one_split hs
  ⟨V, IsOpen.mem_nhds Vo V1, hV⟩

/-- Given a neighborhood `U` of `1` there is an open neighborhood `V` of `1`
such that `V * V ⊆ U`. -/
@[to_additive /-- Given an open neighborhood `U` of `0` there is an open neighborhood `V` of `0`
  such that `V + V ⊆ U`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Monoid/Varianta469478f410b3f72e3a98ef92475f885054db1464983b4a21fd422c9891f2b1d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Monoid/Varianta469478f410b3f72e3a98ef92475f885054db1464983b4a21fd422c9891f2b1d.lean#L592).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7e97bd3384a24c3b0ffdafc711bd1ca099d124af` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
