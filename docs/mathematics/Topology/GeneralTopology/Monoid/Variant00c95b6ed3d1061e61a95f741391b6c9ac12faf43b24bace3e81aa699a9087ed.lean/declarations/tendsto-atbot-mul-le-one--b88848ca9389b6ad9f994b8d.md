## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d812672a-f68f-ed5d-26a3-86256808227e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–90.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Tendsto.atBot_mul_le_one (hf : Tendsto f l atBot) (hg : ∀ x, g x ≤ 1) :
    Tendsto (fun x => f x * g x) l atBot :=
  hf.atBot_mul_eventuallyLE_one (.of_forall hg)

@[deprecated (since := "2025-02-13")]
alias tendsto_atBot_add_nonpos_right := Tendsto.atBot_add_nonpos

/-- In an ordered multiplicative monoid, if `f` and `g` tend to `+∞`, then so does `f * g`.

Earlier, this name was used for a similar lemma about semirings,
which is now called `Filter.Tendsto.atTop_mul_atTop₀`. -/
@[to_additive]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Monoid/Variant00c95b6ed3d1061e61a95f741391b6c9ac12faf43b24bace3e81aa699a9087ed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Monoid/Variant00c95b6ed3d1061e61a95f741391b6c9ac12faf43b24bace3e81aa699a9087ed.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ed493a271055998212b9ce43869aa4df770abd45` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
