## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:24ab4ac4-47b1-445f-84f1-e26653fbf240`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 246–250.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_atTop_of_add_bdd_above_right' (C) (hC : ∀ᶠ x in l, g x ≤ C)
    (h : Tendsto (fun x => f x + g x) l atTop) : Tendsto f l atTop :=
  h.atTop_of_add_isBoundedUnder_le ⟨C, hC⟩

@[deprecated Tendsto.atBot_of_add_isBoundedUnder_ge (since := "2025-02-13")]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Monoid/Variant1b78ab76557182d6df0d65fa0d986ae802fa1185ed656b7aa12628e6da13e2bb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Monoid/Variant1b78ab76557182d6df0d65fa0d986ae802fa1185ed656b7aa12628e6da13e2bb.lean#L246).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `652eb661b8e7c0f2e110bebb030dd2c1af10b2bb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
