## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:261640e1-c0fa-0a0d-f9a2-fa912f162f40`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 400–410.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_mul_prod_nhds_zero_of_disjoint_cocompact {l : Filter M}
    (hl : Disjoint l (cocompact M)) :
    Tendsto (fun x : M × M ↦ x.1 * x.2) (l ×ˢ 𝓝 0) (𝓝 0) := calc
  map (fun x : M × M ↦ x.1 * x.2) (l ×ˢ 𝓝 0)
  _ ≤ map (fun x : M × M ↦ x.1 * x.2) (𝓝ˢ (Set.univ ×ˢ {0})) :=
    map_mono <| prod_nhds_le_of_disjoint_cocompact 0 hl
  _ ≤ 𝓝 0 := continuous_mul.tendsto_nhdsSet_nhds fun _ ⟨_, hx⟩ ↦ mul_eq_zero_of_right _ hx

/-- Let `M` be a topological space with a continuous multiplication operation and a `0`.
Let `l` be a filter on `M × M` which is disjoint from the cocompact filter. Then, the multiplication
map `M × M → M` tends to zero on `(𝓝 0).coprod (𝓝 0) ⊓ l`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Monoid/Variant53ba46f7225d361500f4a5e9aec0c1a57fedc2bb6ec5f985dde55f5f413f33a6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Monoid/Variant53ba46f7225d361500f4a5e9aec0c1a57fedc2bb6ec5f985dde55f5f413f33a6.lean#L400).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1ba89818532648a48f4c2d8a5727a4fd00757111` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
