## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0e6a6d14724e64fda1dec752cff117a89c21f760b45f2bd0e2089ca88dcb7665`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1206–1215.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def compContinuousLinearMapL (f : ∀ i, E i →L[𝕜] E₁ i) :
    ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E₁ G →L[𝕜] ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E G :=
  LinearMap.mkContinuous
    { toFun := fun g => g.compContinuousLinearMap f
      map_add' := fun _ _ => rfl
      map_smul' := fun _ _ => rfl } (∏ i, ‖f i‖) fun _ =>
    (norm_compContinuousLinearMap_le _ _).trans_eq (mul_comm _ _)
#align continuous_multilinear_map.comp_continuous_linear_mapL ContinuousMultilinearMap.compContinuousLinearMapL

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Multilinear/Variantefb64fe0b05ea93b9a4be92de24b639e55d5689954a810f4e2102ca1c4aa7124.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Multilinear/Variantefb64fe0b05ea93b9a4be92de24b639e55d5689954a810f4e2102ca1c4aa7124.lean#L1206).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `eb7d6a77e37c67ebd04eb70781e0d39590c8ab69` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
