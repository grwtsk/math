## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:951be265794c7cb0d29a50e34481d53ee005e62500ad5479bd17ca8445afd88c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1829–1860.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

def currySumEquiv : ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 (fun _ : Sum ι ι' => G) G' ≃ₗᵢ[𝕜]
    ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 (fun _ : ι => G) (ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 (fun _ : ι' => G) G') :=
  LinearIsometryEquiv.ofBounds
    { toFun := currySum
      invFun := uncurrySum
      map_add' := fun f g => by

      right_inv := fun f => by
        ext m₁ m₂

variable (𝕜 G G') {k l : ℕ} {s : Finset (Fin n)}

/-- If `s : Finset (Fin n)` is a finite set of cardinality `k` and its complement has cardinality
`l`, then the space of continuous multilinear maps `G [×n]→L[𝕜] G'` of `n` variables is isomorphic
to the space of continuous multilinear maps `G [×k]→L[𝕜] G [×l]→L[𝕜] G'` of `k` variables taking
values in the space of continuous multilinear maps of `l` variables. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Multilinear/Variantdb427d00cf1fc7ffe745da4777490871fe77a0c5112a86ecd97c31eefe64fd3b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Multilinear/Variantdb427d00cf1fc7ffe745da4777490871fe77a0c5112a86ecd97c31eefe64fd3b.lean#L1829).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c9ea4c907ee19bb86bfb8a13880dbb434356eeee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
