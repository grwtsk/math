## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b5f6962835879a7bc0f7f7c33d8897e6c8be900c7026c4d031308b1c1b364d7a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1632–1640.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ContinuousMultilinearMap.uncurry0 (f : ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 (fun _ : Fin 0 => G) G') :
    G' :=
  f 0
#align continuous_multilinear_map.uncurry0 ContinuousMultilinearMap.uncurry0

variable (𝕜 G)

/-- Associating to an element `x` of a vector space `E₂` the continuous multilinear map in `0`
variables taking the (unique) value `x` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Multilinear/Variantdb427d00cf1fc7ffe745da4777490871fe77a0c5112a86ecd97c31eefe64fd3b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Multilinear/Variantdb427d00cf1fc7ffe745da4777490871fe77a0c5112a86ecd97c31eefe64fd3b.lean#L1632).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c9ea4c907ee19bb86bfb8a13880dbb434356eeee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
