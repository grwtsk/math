## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9b54414d2d35854b2f67ef23b4a5c3d71559d2d987361f489fb86a0c80db025b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 19–41.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example : Continuous archimedeanMultiplier := by
  have ho : IsOpen {z : ℂ | 0 < z.re} :=
    Complex.continuous_re.isOpen_preimage _ isOpen_Ioi
  have hn (z : ℂ) (hz : 0 < z.re) : ∀ m : ℕ, z ≠ -m := by
    intro m hm
    have he := congrArg Complex.re hm
    simp only [Complex.neg_re, Complex.natCast_re] at he
    have hm0 : (0 : ℝ) ≤ m := Nat.cast_nonneg m
    linarith
  have hg : AnalyticOnNhd ℂ Complex.Gamma {z : ℂ | 0 < z.re} := by
    apply DifferentiableOn.analyticOnNhd _ ho
    intro z hz
    exact (Complex.differentiableAt_Gamma z (hn z hz)).differentiableWithinAt
  apply continuous_iff_continuousAt.mpr
  intro ξ
  have hz : 0 < ((1 / 4 : ℂ) + Complex.I * (ξ : ℂ) / 2).re := by simp
  have hc := ((hg _ hz).deriv.div (hg _ hz) (Complex.Gamma_ne_zero (hn _ hz))).continuousAt
  have hp : Continuous (fun ξ : ℝ ↦ (1 / 4 : ℂ) + Complex.I * (ξ : ℂ) / 2) := by fun_prop
  have hd : ContinuousAt Complex.digamma ((1 / 4 : ℂ) + Complex.I * (ξ : ℂ) / 2) := hc
  change ContinuousAt (fun ξ : ℝ ↦ (Complex.digamma ((1 / 4 : ℂ) + Complex.I * (ξ : ℂ) / 2)).re - Real.log Real.pi) ξ
  have hdcomp : ContinuousAt (fun ξ : ℝ ↦ Complex.digamma ((1 / 4 : ℂ) + Complex.I * (ξ : ℂ) / 2)) ξ :=
    hd.comp (f := fun ξ : ℝ ↦ (1 / 4 : ℂ) + Complex.I * (ξ : ℂ) / 2) hp.continuousAt
  exact (Complex.continuous_re.continuousAt.comp hdcomp).sub continuousAt_const
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/AdmissionDirectProbe/Variant10a1c4325f67be885f4f08df4af4c8bd3582868df6afbb88b913ce30263c402a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/AdmissionDirectProbe/Variant10a1c4325f67be885f4f08df4af4c8bd3582868df6afbb88b913ce30263c402a.lean#L19).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `142a94a7434a8863047b3d8314c7c74e868fec3f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
