## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d301bb9de0f875d153f5b7d2dbc830d01ed66f4b0ab6475eecce0c009a5b1ce3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 41–45.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class QuasiCompact (f : X ⟶ Y) : Prop where
  /-- Preimage of compact open set under a quasi-compact morphism between schemes is compact. -/
  isCompact_preimage : ∀ U : Set Y.carrier, IsOpen U → IsCompact U → IsCompact (f.1.base ⁻¹' U)
#align algebraic_geometry.quasi_compact AlgebraicGeometry.QuasiCompact

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/QuasiCompact/Variant35390e2f038a0399e0efee4956daece509c65c150ac749758f270d7417e60cd0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/QuasiCompact/Variant35390e2f038a0399e0efee4956daece509c65c150ac749758f270d7417e60cd0.lean#L41).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6e831017f254a9020ca5d9d84886c006d9492e1e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
