## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e6701d55-d8f9-16ab-15fc-c852e7816a77`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 615–619.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lowerSemicontinuousOn_ciSup {f : ι → α → δ'}
    (bdd : ∀ x ∈ s, BddAbove (range fun i => f i x)) (h : ∀ i, LowerSemicontinuousOn (f i) s) :
    LowerSemicontinuousOn (fun x' => ⨆ i, f i x') s := fun x hx =>
  lowerSemicontinuousWithinAt_ciSup (eventually_nhdsWithin_of_forall bdd) fun i => h i x hx

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Semicontinuous/Varianta8e1a0bd62dfec23c9badb7be6f993d00120db044f30abe8dcec28903e9e1830.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Semicontinuous/Varianta8e1a0bd62dfec23c9badb7be6f993d00120db044f30abe8dcec28903e9e1830.lean#L615).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
