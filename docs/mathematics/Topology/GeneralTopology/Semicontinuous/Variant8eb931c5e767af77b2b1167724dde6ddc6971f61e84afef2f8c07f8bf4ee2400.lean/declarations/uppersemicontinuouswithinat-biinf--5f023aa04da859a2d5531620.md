## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8bcbef4c-815f-9be7-0ac3-07264c76f089`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1017–1022.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem upperSemicontinuousWithinAt_biInf {p : ι → Prop} {f : ∀ (i) (_h : p i), α → δ}
    (h : ∀ i hi, UpperSemicontinuousWithinAt (f i hi) s x) :
    UpperSemicontinuousWithinAt (fun x' => ⨅ (i) (hi), f i hi x') s x :=
  upperSemicontinuousWithinAt_iInf fun i => upperSemicontinuousWithinAt_iInf fun hi => h i hi
#align upper_semicontinuous_within_at_binfi upperSemicontinuousWithinAt_biInf

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Semicontinuous/Variant8eb931c5e767af77b2b1167724dde6ddc6971f61e84afef2f8c07f8bf4ee2400.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Semicontinuous/Variant8eb931c5e767af77b2b1167724dde6ddc6971f61e84afef2f8c07f8bf4ee2400.lean#L1017).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f469bca6e9ca2ec3703fce6cc168ac9146931f28` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
