## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:26c37e7e-c3f4-7814-4b69-ec0826691b03`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 306–313.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lowerSemicontinuousOn_iff_le_liminf {f : α → γ} :
    LowerSemicontinuousOn f s ↔ ∀ x ∈ s, f x ≤ liminf f (𝓝[s] x) := by
  simp only [← lowerSemicontinuousWithinAt_iff_le_liminf, LowerSemicontinuousOn]

alias ⟨LowerSemicontinuousOn.le_liminf, _⟩ := lowerSemicontinuousOn_iff_le_liminf

variable [TopologicalSpace γ] [OrderTopology γ]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Semicontinuous/Variante76304dd95bb6b710fce7c94e355f0e5503b0e34df152280cf32017f7d758b0f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Semicontinuous/Variante76304dd95bb6b710fce7c94e355f0e5503b0e34df152280cf32017f7d758b0f.lean#L306).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f8a1938f867d22ceac0c4eee6a95b759f91b45b4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
