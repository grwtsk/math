## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7d56ff97-7673-a2a4-0467-6c7e92f61df8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 347–352.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContinuousAt.comp_lowerSemicontinuousAt_antitone {g : γ → δ} {f : α → γ}
    (hg : ContinuousAt g (f x)) (hf : LowerSemicontinuousAt f x) (gmon : Antitone g) :
    UpperSemicontinuousAt (g ∘ f) x :=
  @ContinuousAt.comp_lowerSemicontinuousAt α _ x γ _ _ _ δᵒᵈ _ _ _ g f hg hf gmon
#align continuous_at.comp_lower_semicontinuous_at_antitone ContinuousAt.comp_lowerSemicontinuousAt_antitone

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Semicontinuous/Variant264f5237d101740aa08d8901efb3fd6814cc8234e1a8ab392f7571f3f1a87dce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Semicontinuous/Variant264f5237d101740aa08d8901efb3fd6814cc8234e1a8ab392f7571f3f1a87dce.lean#L347).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5982d8fd08d39c55b13510ba505ca5d52ffffb52` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
