## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:faa29e10-7f62-98cd-6778-0fb932204c26`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 151–157.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Tendsto.countable_compl_preimage_ker {f : α → β}
    {l : Filter β} [l.IsCountablyGenerated] (h : Tendsto f cofinite l) :
    Set.Countable (f ⁻¹' l.ker)ᶜ := by rw [← ker_comap]; exact countable_compl_ker h.le_comap

/-- Given a collection of filters `l i : Filter (α i)` and sets `s i ∈ l i`,
if all but finitely many of `s i` are the whole space,
then their indexed product `Set.pi Set.univ s` belongs to the filter `Filter.pi l`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Cofinite/Variantf47f12cff779b54f4b0f7418405ea66d1f424189cd14a1e2cc42aa31bd27054b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Cofinite/Variantf47f12cff779b54f4b0f7418405ea66d1f424189cd14a1e2cc42aa31bd27054b.lean#L151).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `89312a85d0510c3cc3094e43326cdfa4a8027674` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
