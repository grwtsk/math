## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:25f404b3-6ec6-be8d-80ba-4a8da0bb3d49`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–154.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma IsClosed.isClosed_image_eval (i : ι)
    (hs_compact : IsCompact s) (hs_closed : IsClosed s) :
    IsClosed ((fun x ↦ x i) '' s) := by
  suffices IsClosed (Set.restrict {i} '' s) by
    have : Homeomorph.piUnique _ ∘ Set.restrict {i} = fun (x : Π j, α j) ↦ x i := rfl
    rwa [← this, image_comp, Homeomorph.isClosed_image (Homeomorph.piUnique _)]
  exact hs_compact.isClosed_image_restrict {i} hs_closed

end IsClosed
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/IsClosedRestrict/Varianta59b4220aba9119985c9a973ff405de64e45bf9acc54fe7eca604f3589c31a9e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/IsClosedRestrict/Varianta59b4220aba9119985c9a973ff405de64e45bf9acc54fe7eca604f3589c31a9e.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3daeeeb0e4b249fa2fc33d2d44c387a102705ee3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
