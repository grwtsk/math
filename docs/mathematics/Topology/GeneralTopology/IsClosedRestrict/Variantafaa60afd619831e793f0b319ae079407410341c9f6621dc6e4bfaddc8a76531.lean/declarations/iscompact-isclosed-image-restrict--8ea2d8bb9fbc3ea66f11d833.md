## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7c7a991b-e541-0332-9d4d-8b358b0443d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 127–136.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsCompact.isClosed_image_restrict (S : Set ι)
    (hs_compact : IsCompact s) (hs_closed : IsClosed s) :
    IsClosed (S.domRestrict '' s) := by
  rw [← Topology.image_snd_preimageImageRestrict]
  have : CompactSpace (Sᶜ.domRestrict '' s) :=
    isCompact_iff_compactSpace.mp (hs_compact.image (Pi.continuous_domRestrict _))
  refine isClosedMap_snd_of_compactSpace _ ?_
  rw [Homeomorph.isClosed_image]
  exact hs_closed.preimage continuous_subtype_val

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/IsClosedRestrict/Variantafaa60afd619831e793f0b319ae079407410341c9f6621dc6e4bfaddc8a76531.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/IsClosedRestrict/Variantafaa60afd619831e793f0b319ae079407410341c9f6621dc6e4bfaddc8a76531.lean#L127).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4a2f8db97317b60738697d767e025ac4aa411474` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
