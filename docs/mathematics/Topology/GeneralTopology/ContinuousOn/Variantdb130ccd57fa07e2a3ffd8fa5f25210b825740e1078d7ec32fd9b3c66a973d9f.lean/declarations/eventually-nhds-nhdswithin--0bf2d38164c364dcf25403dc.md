## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:89f5a887-1d6e-abcf-8167-91c1ae53214b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 54–58.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eventually_nhds_nhdsWithin {a : α} {s : Set α} {p : α → Prop} :
    (∀ᶠ y in 𝓝 a, ∀ᶠ x in 𝓝[s] y, p x) ↔ ∀ᶠ x in 𝓝[s] a, p x :=
  Filter.ext_iff.1 nhds_bind_nhdsWithin { x | p x }
#align eventually_nhds_nhds_within eventually_nhds_nhdsWithin

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ContinuousOn/Variantdb130ccd57fa07e2a3ffd8fa5f25210b825740e1078d7ec32fd9b3c66a973d9f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ContinuousOn/Variantdb130ccd57fa07e2a3ffd8fa5f25210b825740e1078d7ec32fd9b3c66a973d9f.lean#L54).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `931e16e1a32865a485503e751b0a0a5459c806c1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
