## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ea51d166-8275-b675-eae2-29364d360988`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 132–144.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem continuousOn_iff' :
    ContinuousOn f s ↔ ∀ t : Set β, IsOpen t → ∃ u, IsOpen u ∧ f ⁻¹' t ∩ s = u ∩ s := by
  have : ∀ t, IsOpen (s.domRestrict f ⁻¹' t) ↔ ∃ u : Set α, IsOpen u ∧ f ⁻¹' t ∩ s = u ∩ s := by
    intro t
    rw [isOpen_induced_iff, Set.domRestrict_eq, Set.preimage_comp]
    simp only [Subtype.preimage_coe_eq_preimage_coe_iff]
    constructor <;>
      · rintro ⟨u, ou, useq⟩
        exact ⟨u, ou, by simpa only [Set.inter_comm, eq_comm] using useq⟩
  rw [continuousOn_iff_continuous_domRestrict, continuous_def]; simp only [this]

/-- If a function is continuous on a set for some topologies, then it is
continuous on the same set with respect to any finer topology on the source space. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ContinuousOn/Variant86cba885de29a9aa9162dcf02347d861be02325e90544ee1fa094ea5901e1758.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ContinuousOn/Variant86cba885de29a9aa9162dcf02347d861be02325e90544ee1fa094ea5901e1758.lean#L132).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `78fa17151b24c9e17a4a36e3393621f136245392` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
