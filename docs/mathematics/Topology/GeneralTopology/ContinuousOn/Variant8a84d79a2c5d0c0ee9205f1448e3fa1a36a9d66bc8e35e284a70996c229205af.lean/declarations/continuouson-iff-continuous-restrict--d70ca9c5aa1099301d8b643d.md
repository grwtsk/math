## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b65ead8d-c606-ec38-a7b6-6d0127117d71`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 589–598.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem continuousOn_iff_continuous_restrict :
    ContinuousOn f s ↔ Continuous (s.restrict f) := by
  rw [ContinuousOn, continuous_iff_continuousAt]; constructor
  · rintro h ⟨x, xs⟩
    exact (continuousWithinAt_iff_continuousAt_restrict f xs).mp (h x xs)
  intro h x xs
  exact (continuousWithinAt_iff_continuousAt_restrict f xs).mpr (h ⟨x, xs⟩)

alias ⟨ContinuousOn.restrict, _⟩ := continuousOn_iff_continuous_restrict

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ContinuousOn/Variant8a84d79a2c5d0c0ee9205f1448e3fa1a36a9d66bc8e35e284a70996c229205af.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ContinuousOn/Variant8a84d79a2c5d0c0ee9205f1448e3fa1a36a9d66bc8e35e284a70996c229205af.lean#L589).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2d379780fcc826eee2cd517fab149c1bad77fe5d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
