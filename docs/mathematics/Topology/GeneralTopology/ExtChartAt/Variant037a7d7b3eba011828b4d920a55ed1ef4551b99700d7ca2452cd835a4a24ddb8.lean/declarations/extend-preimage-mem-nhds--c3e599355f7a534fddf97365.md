## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:db80b49b-b86f-065c-9b3c-ff81cd68fa30`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 289–296.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem extend_preimage_mem_nhds {x : M} (h : x ∈ f.source) (ht : t ∈ 𝓝 x) :
    (f.extend I).symm ⁻¹' t ∈ 𝓝 (f.extend I x) := by
  apply (continuousAt_extend_symm f h).preimage_mem_nhds
  rwa [(f.extend I).left_inv]
  rwa [f.extend_source]

/-- Technical lemma to rewrite suitably the preimage of an intersection under an extended chart, to
bring it into a convenient form to apply derivative lemmas. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ExtChartAt/Variant037a7d7b3eba011828b4d920a55ed1ef4551b99700d7ca2452cd835a4a24ddb8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ExtChartAt/Variant037a7d7b3eba011828b4d920a55ed1ef4551b99700d7ca2452cd835a4a24ddb8.lean#L289).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8502555daa720e5e330ba3ce074e4182e3241a26` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
