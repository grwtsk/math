## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b4605c4e-3942-4b6e-cd67-a4c46f7facf6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 744–749.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem extChartAt_preimage_mem_nhds' {x x' : M} (h : x' ∈ (extChartAt I x).source)
    (ht : t ∈ 𝓝 x') : (extChartAt I x).symm ⁻¹' t ∈ 𝓝 (extChartAt I x x') :=
  extend_preimage_mem_nhds _ (by rwa [← extChartAt_source I]) ht

/-- Technical lemma ensuring that the preimage under an extended chart of a neighborhood of a point
is a neighborhood of the preimage. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ExtChartAt/Variant6cc78a4df72bad2bca7ad49abd2389b8db46b7930c0df69070dad1c6b39a1820.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ExtChartAt/Variant6cc78a4df72bad2bca7ad49abd2389b8db46b7930c0df69070dad1c6b39a1820.lean#L744).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6b337d328242f336eeab7d7242366ff906bfecda` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
