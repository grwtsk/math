## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:70831963d3272ebf13fd21474b0b5c9c7c1a3fdb392608be99844068fd462573`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 550–568.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev UnitAddCircle :=
  AddCircle (1 : ℝ)
#align unit_add_circle UnitAddCircle

section IdentifyIccEnds

/-! This section proves that for any `a`, the natural map from `[a, a + p] ⊂ 𝕜` to `AddCircle p`
gives an identification of `AddCircle p`, as a topological space, with the quotient of `[a, a + p]`
by the equivalence relation identifying the endpoints. -/


namespace AddCircle

variable [LinearOrderedAddCommGroup 𝕜] [TopologicalSpace 𝕜] [OrderTopology 𝕜] (p a : 𝕜)
  [hp : Fact (0 < p)]

local notation "𝕋" => AddCircle p

/-- The relation identifying the endpoints of `Icc a (a + p)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/AddCircle/Variantbc32391a99d37a1d3688161c757f9a26496ccb2b633011b6304002d97866687b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/AddCircle/Variantbc32391a99d37a1d3688161c757f9a26496ccb2b633011b6304002d97866687b.lean#L550).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a755dc49e1d1927307d4bdc4528c932fc4d7884` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
