## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fba49f13-e69a-e1dd-e911-19d3f44d31f7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 129–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Homeomorph.paracompactSpace_iff (e : X ≃ₜ Y) : ParacompactSpace X ↔ ParacompactSpace Y :=
  ⟨fun _ ↦ e.symm.isClosedEmbedding.paracompactSpace, fun _ ↦ e.isClosedEmbedding.paracompactSpace⟩

/-- The product of a compact space and a paracompact space is a paracompact space. The formalization
is based on https://dantopology.wordpress.com/2009/10/24/compact-x-paracompact-is-paracompact/
with some minor modifications.

This version assumes that `X` in `X × Y` is compact and `Y` is paracompact, see next lemma for the
other case. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Paracompact/Variant172887137e6f6456649d44a4f1e862da6a5ed5bc21180d64644aa43bad5a72d3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Paracompact/Variant172887137e6f6456649d44a4f1e862da6a5ed5bc21180d64644aa43bad5a72d3.lean#L129).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8d4dcac49497f753f50b685b559543173cc1c4fe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
