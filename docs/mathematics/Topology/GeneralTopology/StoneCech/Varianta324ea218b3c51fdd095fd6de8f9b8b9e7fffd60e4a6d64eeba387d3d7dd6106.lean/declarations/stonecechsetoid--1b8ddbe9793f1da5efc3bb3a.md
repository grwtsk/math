## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1ae55c7cdcd3b9c178b7da641a210231c79e4f05dcdb8db17353e7b222e858f8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 232–243.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance stoneCechSetoid : Setoid (Ultrafilter α)
    where
  r x y :=
    ∀ (γ : Type u) [TopologicalSpace γ],
      ∀ [T2Space γ] [CompactSpace γ] (f : α → γ) (_ : Continuous f),
        Ultrafilter.extend f x = Ultrafilter.extend f y
  iseqv :=
    ⟨fun _ _ _ _ _ _ _ => rfl, @fun _ _ xy γ _ _ _ f hf => (xy γ f hf).symm,
      @fun _ _ _ xy yz γ _ _ _ f hf => (xy γ f hf).trans (yz γ f hf)⟩
#align stone_cech_setoid stoneCechSetoid

/-- The Stone-Čech compactification of a topological space. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/StoneCech/Varianta324ea218b3c51fdd095fd6de8f9b8b9e7fffd60e4a6d64eeba387d3d7dd6106.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/StoneCech/Varianta324ea218b3c51fdd095fd6de8f9b8b9e7fffd60e4a6d64eeba387d3d7dd6106.lean#L232).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2cfeeb535a579c0bbf4555ead31d4a08427559f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
