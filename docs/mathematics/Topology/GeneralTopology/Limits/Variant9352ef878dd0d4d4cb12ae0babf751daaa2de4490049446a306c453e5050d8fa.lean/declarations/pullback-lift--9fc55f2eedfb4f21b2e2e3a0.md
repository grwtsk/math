## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5d7ab269f11b8cc3ba96fb7d6bfe2514755172dd6f643d168cc31084ca4f0231`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 243–249.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def pullback.lift {Z : CompHausLike P} (a : Z ⟶ X) (b : Z ⟶ Y) (w : a ≫ f = b ≫ g) :
    Z ⟶ pullback f g :=
  ConcreteCategory.ofHom
  { toFun := fun z ↦ ⟨⟨a z, b z⟩, by apply_fun (fun q ↦ q z) at w; exact w⟩
    continuous_toFun := by fun_prop }

@[reassoc (attr := simp)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Limits/Variant9352ef878dd0d4d4cb12ae0babf751daaa2de4490049446a306c453e5050d8fa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Limits/Variant9352ef878dd0d4d4cb12ae0babf751daaa2de4490049446a306c453e5050d8fa.lean#L243).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9a50c398075b2a6096b215eb1e649d9fe1166a13` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
