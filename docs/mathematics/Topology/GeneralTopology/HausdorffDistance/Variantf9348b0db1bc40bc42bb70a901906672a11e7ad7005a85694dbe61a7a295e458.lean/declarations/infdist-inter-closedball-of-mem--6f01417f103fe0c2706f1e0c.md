## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b5527041-80f1-32d0-7106-70d22137141c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 626–637.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem infDist_inter_closedBall_of_mem (h : y ∈ s) :
    infDist x (s ∩ closedBall x (dist y x)) = infDist x s := by
  replace h : y ∈ s ∩ closedBall x (dist y x) := ⟨h, mem_closedBall.2 le_rfl⟩
  refine le_antisymm ?_ (infDist_le_infDist_of_subset (inter_subset_left _ _) ⟨y, h⟩)
  refine' not_lt.1 fun hlt => _
  rcases (infDist_lt_iff ⟨y, h.1⟩).mp hlt with ⟨z, hzs, hz⟩
  cases' le_or_lt (dist z x) (dist y x) with hle hlt
  · exact hz.not_le (infDist_le_dist_of_mem ⟨hzs, hle⟩)
  · rw [dist_comm z, dist_comm y] at hlt
    exact (hlt.trans hz).not_le (infDist_le_dist_of_mem h)
#align metric.inf_dist_inter_closed_ball_of_mem Metric.infDist_inter_closedBall_of_mem

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/HausdorffDistance/Variantf9348b0db1bc40bc42bb70a901906672a11e7ad7005a85694dbe61a7a295e458.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/HausdorffDistance/Variantf9348b0db1bc40bc42bb70a901906672a11e7ad7005a85694dbe61a7a295e458.lean#L626).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `58cd97ea1567cab3e19f1cd95c79eda3a9517db7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
