## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d1c24de3-625f-1bfd-55b6-73f6ec9f5eac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–100.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem actualLeadingComplexCoefficient_eq {z : ℂ} (hz : 0 < z.re) :
    actualLeadingComplexCoefficient z = 384 / z^3 - 96 / z^5 := by
  have hzn : z ≠ 0 := by intro he; rw [he] at hz; simp at hz
  have hh := integral_Ioi_of_hasDerivAt_of_tendsto'
    (a := (0 : ℝ)) (fun u _ => actualLeadingComplexAntiderivative_hasDerivAt hzn u)
    (actualLeadingComplexCoefficient_integrable hz)
    (actualLeadingComplexAntiderivative_tendsto_zero hz)
  simpa [actualLeadingComplexCoefficient, actualLeadingComplexAntiderivative] using hh

end
end FormalResearch.RiemannHypothesis.SourceActualComplexEndpointCoefficient
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualComplexEndpointCoefficient/Variantb6e3332801074a5ba520455d0c1643afdca27e751de520dbef24303c898dee6f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualComplexEndpointCoefficient/Variantb6e3332801074a5ba520455d0c1643afdca27e751de520dbef24303c898dee6f.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9df7b8f102abe06de917566ff9ea30b137bf200d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
