## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:65323a65-9c2a-8d68-3270-9b109723ac86`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–182.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem NoetherianSpace.exists_finite_set_closeds_irreducible [NoetherianSpace α] (s : Closeds α) :
    ∃ S : Set (Closeds α), S.Finite ∧ (∀ t ∈ S, IsIrreducible (t : Set α)) ∧ s = sSup S := by
  apply wellFounded_lt.induction s; clear s
  intro s H
  rcases eq_or_ne s ⊥ with rfl | h₀
  · use ∅; simp
  · by_cases h₁ : IsPreirreducible (s : Set α)
    · replace h₁ : IsIrreducible (s : Set α) := ⟨Closeds.coe_nonempty.2 h₀, h₁⟩

    · simp only [isPreirreducible_iff_isClosed_union_isClosed, not_forall, not_or] at h₁

      lift z₁ to Closeds α using hz₁
      lift z₂ to Closeds α using hz₂
      rcases H (s ⊓ z₁) (inf_lt_left.2 hz₁') with ⟨S₁, hSf₁, hS₁, h₁⟩
      rcases H (s ⊓ z₂) (inf_lt_left.2 hz₂') with ⟨S₂, hSf₂, hS₂, h₂⟩
      refine ⟨S₁ ∪ S₂, hSf₁.union hSf₂, Set.union_subset_iff.2 ⟨hS₁, hS₂⟩, ?_⟩

/-- In a Noetherian space, every closed set is a finite union of irreducible closed sets. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/NoetherianSpace/Variantc875de4bc65e36fc97281b67d11444950ad0d2de9ee47cb0b31ced89866c277a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/NoetherianSpace/Variantc875de4bc65e36fc97281b67d11444950ad0d2de9ee47cb0b31ced89866c277a.lean#L164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb4b2f547532ff6a01ed6cf3618f0e8dcc960b5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
