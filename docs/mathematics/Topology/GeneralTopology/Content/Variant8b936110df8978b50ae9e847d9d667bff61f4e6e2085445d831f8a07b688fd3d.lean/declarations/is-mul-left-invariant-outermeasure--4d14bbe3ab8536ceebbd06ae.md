## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b864c6e4-4786-0dd1-1cf1-0596c0a7a238`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 302–306.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem is_mul_left_invariant_outerMeasure [Group G] [ContinuousMul G]
    (h : ∀ (g : G) {K : Compacts G}, μ (K.map _ <| continuous_mul_left g) = μ K) (g : G)
    (A : Set G) : μ.outerMeasure ((g * ·) ⁻¹' A) = μ.outerMeasure A := by
  convert μ.outerMeasure_preimage (Homeomorph.mulLeft g) (fun K => h g) A

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Content/Variant8b936110df8978b50ae9e847d9d667bff61f4e6e2085445d831f8a07b688fd3d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Content/Variant8b936110df8978b50ae9e847d9d667bff61f4e6e2085445d831f8a07b688fd3d.lean#L302).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8685ee6555367d06b0f7b373c3d9dd971b9bcdac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
