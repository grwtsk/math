## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c291d5bf-a543-8a5e-f2c5-083c0151dd14`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 104–109.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sup_le (K₁ K₂ : Compacts G) : μ (K₁ ⊔ K₂) ≤ μ K₁ + μ K₂ := by
  simp only [apply_eq_coe_toFun]
  norm_cast
  exact μ.sup_le' _ _
#align measure_theory.content.sup_le MeasureTheory.Content.sup_le

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Content/Variant6a3bcbf827b99f45a7f953a471f9bb914445fb6d8040bdcdd28c1313999e4f09.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Content/Variant6a3bcbf827b99f45a7f953a471f9bb914445fb6d8040bdcdd28c1313999e4f09.lean#L104).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d541fbc6900566162eae4801fceb6aea2c874a8c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
