## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9b23e59471f93f2036176d2b7d2af075057d7f3a24c38e9ef7ae73229c3e9008`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 39–49.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class SupConvergenceClass (α : Type*) [Preorder α] [TopologicalSpace α] : Prop where
  /-- proof that a monotone function tends to `𝓝 a` as `x → ∞` -/
  tendsto_coe_atTop_isLUB :
    ∀ (a : α) (s : Set α), IsLUB s a → Tendsto ((↑) : s → α) atTop (𝓝 a)

/-- We say that `α` is an `InfConvergenceClass` if the following holds. Let `f : ι → α` be a
monotone function, let `a : α` be a greatest lower bound of `Set.range f`. Then `f x` tends to `𝓝 a`
as `x → -∞` (formally, at the filter `Filter.atBot`). We require this for `ι = (s : Set α)`,
`f = (↑)` in the definition, then prove it for any `f` in `tendsto_atBot_isGLB`.

This property holds for linear orders with order topology as well as their products. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/MonotoneConvergence/Varianta25c65251355a6572ac43603ba47804b109a1f57a2c2c99ed7b3a9fe9cb86f60.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/MonotoneConvergence/Varianta25c65251355a6572ac43603ba47804b109a1f57a2c2c99ed7b3a9fe9cb86f60.lean#L39).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5edbce3f79ce364583912471e4dc6f315b8ddff0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
