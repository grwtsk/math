## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:733d4f6a-d888-551e-8fcd-e5a6c3295826`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 359–366.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem iSup_eq_iSup_subseq_of_antitone {ι₁ ι₂ α : Type*} [Preorder ι₂] [CompleteLattice α]
    {l : Filter ι₁} [l.NeBot] {f : ι₂ → α} {φ : ι₁ → ι₂} (hf : Antitone f)
    (hφ : Tendsto φ l atBot) : ⨆ i, f i = ⨆ i, f (φ i) :=
  le_antisymm
    (iSup_mono' fun i =>
      Exists.imp (fun j (hj : φ j ≤ i) => hf hj) (hφ.eventually <| eventually_le_atBot i).exists)
    (iSup_mono' fun i => ⟨φ i, le_rfl⟩)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/MonotoneConvergence/Variant53b89abe67c3435ec559b30e97f0314b850c79f2b22cc208ab5ee6f90234a907.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/MonotoneConvergence/Variant53b89abe67c3435ec559b30e97f0314b850c79f2b22cc208ab5ee6f90234a907.lean#L359).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5a0e82ff7a97f4f23dcbd9b63dfc0a268924d85d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
