## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:497102e3-db8d-9120-e51b-d6c724fe057e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 82–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma hermForm_smul (r : ℝ) (A : Matrix n n 𝕜) (x : n → 𝕜) :
    hermForm ((r : 𝕜) • A) x = r * hermForm A x := by
  unfold hermForm
  rw [smul_mulVec, dotProduct_smul, smul_eq_mul, RCLike.re_ofReal_mul]

/-- The positive index is at most the rank: `#{λᵢ > 0} ≤ #{λᵢ ≠ 0}`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ZeroSide/Variant239d6e0d6b187f0713ca8ef0955964876f99e7f28f29504f7149f555799a898a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ZeroSide/Variant239d6e0d6b187f0713ca8ef0955964876f99e7f28f29504f7149f555799a898a.lean#L82).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8003f91d09d94a4485213d0a819e7dd2ac406321` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
