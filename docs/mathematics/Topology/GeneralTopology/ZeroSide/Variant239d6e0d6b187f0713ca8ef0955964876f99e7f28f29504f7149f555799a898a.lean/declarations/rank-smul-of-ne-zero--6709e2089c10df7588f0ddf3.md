## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e9038e4b-41c6-91a8-5a04-6d810753c862`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 137–168.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-! ## Section 2. The abstract block structure (paper §4: [eq:AE], Block structure, [eq:Ncount], [prop:block])

Paper §4, Block structure, verbatim: "Let 𝒵(I') be the set of distinct zeros with γ ∈ I'. Classify its
points as follows: 𝒮₁: β = ½ and m_ρ = 1 (simple zeros on the line); s₁ := #𝒮₁; 𝒮₂: β = ½ and
m_ρ ≥ 2; s₂ := #𝒮₂; 𝒫: unordered pairs {ρ, 1−ρ̄} with β ≠ ½ (both members lie in 𝒵(I'), they are
distinct points, and m_{1−ρ̄} = m_ρ); p := #𝒫. Thus #𝒵(I') = s₁+s₂+2p and, counting with
multiplicity, N(I') = Σ_{𝒮₁} 1 + Σ_{𝒮₂} m_ρ + Σ_{𝒫} 2m_ρ ≥ s₁+2s₂+2p. [eq:Ncount]
Write N_on(I') := Σ_{ρ∈𝒮₁∪𝒮₂} m_ρ, so that also N(I') ≥ N_on(I') + 2p."

We encode 𝒵(I') as a finite index type ι, the grid {0,…,d−1} as a finite type d, and carry:
multiplicities m (≥ 1, explicit — zeros are DISTINCT points), the involution σ = (ρ ↦ 1−ρ̄)
restricted to 𝒵(I') (it preserves the ordinate, hence 𝒵(I')), and the evaluation vectors
u_ρ = (φ̂(γ_ρ − τ_k))_{k<d} ∈ ℂ^d with u_{1−ρ̄} = conj u_ρ (from γ_{1−ρ̄} = conj γ_ρ, τ_k ∈ ℝ, and
conj φ̂(z̄) = φ̂(z) [subsec:family after eq:fk]). On-line ⟺ β = ½ ⟺ σ ρ = ρ.

/-- Abstract zero-side data of the window 𝒵(I') [§4 Block structure]: distinct points z : ι with
explicit multiplicity `m z ≥ 1`, evaluation vectors `v z = (φ̂(γ_z − τ_k))_k`, and the involution
`σ = (ρ ↦ 1 − ρ̄)` with `m ∘ σ = m` and `v (σ z) = conj ∘ v z`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ZeroSide/Variant239d6e0d6b187f0713ca8ef0955964876f99e7f28f29504f7149f555799a898a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
