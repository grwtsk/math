## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:69a2519f-d7be-6cbb-b41b-c82b8197e82a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 115–123.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem orthonormal_representedPlane_mem_intrinsicControlledPivotDomain_iff
    (A : FullRankFrame k n) (hA : A.val * A.val.transpose = 1) (I : Fin k ↪o Fin n) :
    representedPlane A ∈ intrinsicControlledPivotDomain I ↔ A.val ∈ controlledPivotDomain I := by
  rw [representedPlane_mem_intrinsicControlledPivotDomain_iff,
    controlledGramPivotDomain_orthonormal_iff A.val hA I]

end

end FormalResearch.PositiveAtlas.Grassmannian
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ControlledTopologyRound3Source/Variant6572762eb7db9a5c5d2273ba1656d47e85f6a51884e53cc7ba265685a8a1968f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ControlledTopologyRound3Source/Variant6572762eb7db9a5c5d2273ba1656d47e85f6a51884e53cc7ba265685a8a1968f.lean#L115).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7ffa37b3436ed0f1462946b74d122bc898cbc5b8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
