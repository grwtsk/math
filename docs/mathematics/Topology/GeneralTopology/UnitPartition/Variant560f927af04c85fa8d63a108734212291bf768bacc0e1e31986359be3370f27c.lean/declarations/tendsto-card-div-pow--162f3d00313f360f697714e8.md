## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d5262e42082e83ab727d71f780ba530be8e56d622c32e06f4ae9ff0722366b26`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 429–434.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def tendsto_card_div_pow₁ {c : ℝ} (hc : c ≠ 0) :
    ↑(s ∩ c⁻¹ • L) ≃ ↑(c • s ∩ L) :=
  Equiv.subtypeEquiv (Equiv.smulRight hc) (fun x ↦ by
    simp_rw [Set.mem_inter_iff, Equiv.smulRight_apply, Set.smul_mem_smul_set_iff₀ hc,
      ← Set.mem_inv_smul_set_iff₀ hc])

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UnitPartition/Variant560f927af04c85fa8d63a108734212291bf768bacc0e1e31986359be3370f27c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UnitPartition/Variant560f927af04c85fa8d63a108734212291bf768bacc0e1e31986359be3370f27c.lean#L429).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e1f40f740a00f169e051af4accc3a0fd54d6230a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
