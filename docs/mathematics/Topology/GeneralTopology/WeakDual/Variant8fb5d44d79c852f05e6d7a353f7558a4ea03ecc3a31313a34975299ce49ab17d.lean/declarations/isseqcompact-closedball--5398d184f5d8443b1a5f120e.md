## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:650c02dc-1065-aeac-4a21-5d5ac0e8b055`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 377–396.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isSeqCompact_closedBall (x' : StrongDual 𝕜 E) (r : ℝ) :
    IsSeqCompact (toStrongDual ⁻¹' Metric.closedBall x' r) :=
  isSeqCompact_of_isBounded_of_isClosed 𝕜 _ (isBounded_closedBall x' r) (isClosed_closedBall x' r)

end WeakDual

section RCLike

open RCLike
open scoped NNReal Topology

namespace WeakDual

variable {α 𝕜 E F : Type*} [TopologicalSpace α] [RCLike 𝕜]
  [AddCommGroup E] [Module 𝕜 E] [AddCommGroup F] [Module 𝕜 F]

/-- A map into `WeakBilin (B : E →ₗ[𝕜] F →ₗ[𝕜] 𝕜)` over `𝕜` (with `RCLike 𝕜`) is
continuous if the real parts of all the evaluation maps `a ↦ B (g a) y` are
continuous for each `y : F`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/WeakDual/Variant8fb5d44d79c852f05e6d7a353f7558a4ea03ecc3a31313a34975299ce49ab17d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/WeakDual/Variant8fb5d44d79c852f05e6d7a353f7558a4ea03ecc3a31313a34975299ce49ab17d.lean#L377).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f9ec0f82265b578948182d0f3c97e192fd484d8e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
