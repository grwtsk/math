## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1bc71250-7398-479a-f7e0-c18e6c10392f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1089–1104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ae_tendsto_measure_inter_div_of_measurableSet (μ : Measure β) [IsLocallyFiniteMeasure μ]
    {s : Set β} (hs : MeasurableSet s) :
    ∀ᵐ x ∂μ,
      Tendsto (fun r => μ (s ∩ closedBall x r) / μ (closedBall x r)) (𝓝[>] 0)
        (𝓝 (s.indicator 1 x)) := by
  filter_upwards [VitaliFamily.ae_tendsto_measure_inter_div_of_measurableSet
      (Besicovitch.vitaliFamily μ) hs]
  intro x hx
  exact hx.comp (tendsto_filterAt μ x)

/-- Given an arbitrary set `s`, then `μ (s ∩ closedBall x r) / μ (closedBall x r)` converges
to `1` when `r` tends to `0`, for almost every `x` in `s`.
This shows that almost every point of `s` is a Lebesgue density point for `s`.
A stronger version holds for measurable sets, see `ae_tendsto_measure_inter_div_of_measurableSet`.

See also `IsUnifLocDoublingMeasure.ae_tendsto_measure_inter_div`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Besicovitch/Variant5798c9820be272d10f16d91e2efc887f3783b3c74d183b315d2aabdab2de0cff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Besicovitch/Variant5798c9820be272d10f16d91e2efc887f3783b3c74d183b315d2aabdab2de0cff.lean#L1089).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6d4971ecfc5f96a35723ba82e66a6aeb9040edf1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
