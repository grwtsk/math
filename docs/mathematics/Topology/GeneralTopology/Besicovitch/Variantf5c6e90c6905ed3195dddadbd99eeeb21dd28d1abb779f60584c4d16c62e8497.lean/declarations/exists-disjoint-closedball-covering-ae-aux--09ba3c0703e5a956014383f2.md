## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:19ba3f11-6f51-d9cb-000c-917467f9a35b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 840–861.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- The measurable Besicovitch covering theorem. Assume that, for any `x` in a set `s`,
one is given a set of admissible closed balls centered at `x`, with arbitrarily small radii.
Then there exists a disjoint covering of almost all `s` by admissible closed balls centered at some
points of `s`. We can even require that the radius at `x` is bounded by a given function `R x`.
(Take `R = 1` if you don't need this additional feature).
This version requires that the underlying measure is sigma-finite, and that the space has the
Besicovitch covering property (which is satisfied for instance by normed real vector spaces).

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Besicovitch/Variantf5c6e90c6905ed3195dddadbd99eeeb21dd28d1abb779f60584c4d16c62e8497.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Besicovitch/Variantf5c6e90c6905ed3195dddadbd99eeeb21dd28d1abb779f60584c4d16c62e8497.lean#L840).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `999c868f4720485989fcdd7dda1ab5b4cb7b5af4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
