## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:71913f1d710c265153b5a3b244d04108631387d37763decdb432e1e94037bca5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 274–285.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def color : Ordinal.{u} → ℕ
  | i =>
    let A : Set ℕ :=
      ⋃ (j : { j // j < i })
        (_ : (closedBall (p.c (p.index j)) (p.r (p.index j)) ∩
          closedBall (p.c (p.index i)) (p.r (p.index i))).Nonempty), {color j}
    sInf (univ \ A)
  termination_by i => i
  decreasing_by exact j.2

/-- `p.lastStep` is the first ordinal where the construction stops making sense, i.e., `f` returns
garbage since there is no point left to be chosen. We will only use ordinals before this step. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Besicovitch/Variant6d1e6ac2ff069c6b100c3b82701bb098746085639d28d7d3f217d443b0e6d6c3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Besicovitch/Variant6d1e6ac2ff069c6b100c3b82701bb098746085639d28d7d3f217d443b0e6d6c3.lean#L274).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `48bdc7ff9eda025caa69372f97de9e37a2f46ef0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
