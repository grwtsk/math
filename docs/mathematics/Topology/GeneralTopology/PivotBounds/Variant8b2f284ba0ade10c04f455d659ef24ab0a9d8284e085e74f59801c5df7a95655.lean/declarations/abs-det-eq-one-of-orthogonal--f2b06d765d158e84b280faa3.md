## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a6534005-2bf1-722f-bf81-364571ca51b8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 189–196.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem abs_det_eq_one_of_orthogonal (O : Matrix (Fin k) (Fin k) ℝ)
    (hO : O * O.transpose = 1) : |O.det| = 1 := by
  have h := congrArg Matrix.det hO
  rw [Matrix.det_mul, Matrix.det_transpose, Matrix.det_one] at h
  have hs : |O.det| ^ 2 = 1 := by rw [sq_abs, pow_two]; exact h
  nlinarith [abs_nonneg O.det]

/-- Controlled cover membership is invariant under replacement of an orthonormal row basis. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/PivotBounds/Variant8b2f284ba0ade10c04f455d659ef24ab0a9d8284e085e74f59801c5df7a95655.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PivotBounds/Variant8b2f284ba0ade10c04f455d659ef24ab0a9d8284e085e74f59801c5df7a95655.lean#L189).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c2f895aa5e792a99ca5c2341354b18e8ebca87e4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
