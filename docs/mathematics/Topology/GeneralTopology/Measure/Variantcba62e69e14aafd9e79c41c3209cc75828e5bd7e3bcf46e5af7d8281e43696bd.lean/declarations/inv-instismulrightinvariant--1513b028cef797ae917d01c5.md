## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e8b9ba9d67978467bed3fd5987bcff30d82f7a6f3d728c2dfe675c18d656ef24`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 377–384.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance inv.instIsMulRightInvariant [IsMulLeftInvariant μ] : IsMulRightInvariant μ.inv := by
  constructor
  intro g
  conv_rhs => rw [← map_mul_left_eq_self μ g⁻¹]
  simp_rw [Measure.inv, map_map (measurable_mul_const g) measurable_inv,
    map_map measurable_inv (measurable_const_mul g⁻¹), Function.comp_def, mul_inv_rev, inv_inv]

@[to_additive]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Measure/Variantcba62e69e14aafd9e79c41c3209cc75828e5bd7e3bcf46e5af7d8281e43696bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Measure/Variantcba62e69e14aafd9e79c41c3209cc75828e5bd7e3bcf46e5af7d8281e43696bd.lean#L377).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6b47bb8ce072504dfaf9080749c99b525d35c91b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
