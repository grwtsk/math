## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:52953671-970d-c99c-6cd8-5e383c318c3c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 225–232.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measurePreserving_div_right (μ : Measure G) [IsMulRightInvariant μ] (g : G) :
    MeasurePreserving (· / g) μ μ := by simp_rw [div_eq_mul_inv, measurePreserving_mul_right μ g⁻¹]

/-- We shorten this from `measure_preimage_mul_left`, since left invariant is the preferred option
  for measures in this formalization. -/
@[to_additive (attr := simp)
"We shorten this from `measure_preimage_add_left`, since left invariant is the preferred option for
measures in this formalization."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Measure/Variantd7d716b5843aa9dbc72a49aa49859e3ef4beb411517528ea9f44ee00bda0d855.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Measure/Variantd7d716b5843aa9dbc72a49aa49859e3ef4beb411517528ea9f44ee00bda0d855.lean#L225).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9af0551171e42e0bccd446f80e6fbb391fea42c8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
