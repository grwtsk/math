## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f7bbb595-849c-61d6-c460-5c2545db127c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 71–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tan_eq_zero_iff {θ : ℂ} : tan θ = 0 ↔ ∃ k : ℤ, θ = k * π / 2 := by
  have h := (sin_two_mul θ).symm
  rw [mul_assoc] at h
  rw [tan, div_eq_zero_iff, ← mul_eq_zero, ← zero_mul (1 / 2 : ℂ), mul_one_div,
    CancelDenoms.cancel_factors_eq_div h two_ne_zero, mul_comm]
  simpa only [zero_div, zero_mul, Ne.def, not_false_iff, field_simps] using
    sin_eq_zero_iff
#align complex.tan_eq_zero_iff Complex.tan_eq_zero_iff

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Complex/Variant6a2f8323e989bb26a297a65df15058f635a93774e6296240e8c5c14aeee56d8d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Complex/Variant6a2f8323e989bb26a297a65df15058f635a93774e6296240e8c5c14aeee56d8d.lean#L71).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5bd1b6e3a38715e4c862f35afa86bb5bd791d742` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
