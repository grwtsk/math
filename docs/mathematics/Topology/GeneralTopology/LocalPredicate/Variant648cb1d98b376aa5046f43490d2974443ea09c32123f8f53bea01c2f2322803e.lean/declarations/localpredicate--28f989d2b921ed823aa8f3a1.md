## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4dcc400a76c5e01ec159bf65d5569f5427fc98960f38a4ea6e384f74da881c3c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 91–100.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure LocalPredicate extends PrelocalPredicate T where
  /-- A local predicate must be local --- provided that it is locally satisfied, it is also globally
    satisfied -/
  locality :
    ∀ {U : Opens X} (f : ∀ x : U, T x)
      (_ : ∀ x : U, ∃ (V : Opens X) (_ : x.1 ∈ V) (i : V ⟶ U),
        pred fun x : V ↦ f (i x : U)), pred f

/-- Continuity is a "local" predicate on functions to a fixed topological space `T`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalPredicate/Variant648cb1d98b376aa5046f43490d2974443ea09c32123f8f53bea01c2f2322803e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalPredicate/Variant648cb1d98b376aa5046f43490d2974443ea09c32123f8f53bea01c2f2322803e.lean#L91).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aaae3065a8daa5594b2ec39c41b4c942b2fe018a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
