## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f4d368de1cea3badcaa969fb1929fe1b6421d881f17a463088e43a0d7d2a849e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 80–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance inhabitedPrelocalPredicate (T) [TopologicalSpace T] :
    Inhabited (PrelocalPredicate fun _ : X ↦ T) :=
  ⟨continuousPrelocal X T⟩

variable {X} in
/-- Given a topological space `X : TopCat` and a type family `T : X → Type`,
a `P : LocalPredicate T` consists of:
* a family of predicates `P.pred`, one for each `U : Opens X`, of the form `(Π x : U, T x) → Prop`
* a proof that if `f : Π x : V, T x` satisfies the predicate on `V : Opens X`, then
  the restriction of `f` to any open subset `U` also satisfies the predicate, and
* a proof that given some `f : Π x : U, T x`,
  if for every `x : U` we can find an open set `x ∈ V ≤ U`
  so that the restriction of `f` to `V` satisfies the predicate,
  then `f` itself satisfies the predicate.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalPredicate/Variantbb29ff7184f85615a8e38691140b1f8603c8e17472d32d4192859386e5537183.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalPredicate/Variantbb29ff7184f85615a8e38691140b1f8603c8e17472d32d4192859386e5537183.lean#L80).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `243541d6420c86b4346c81579a8f7eb0607c1cea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
