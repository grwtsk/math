## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f34b4488cf6de668644addd047dde82631f87ca394543cc9e23c368ccf678775`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 134–141.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def LocalPredicate.and (P Q : LocalPredicate T) : LocalPredicate T where
  __ := P.1.and Q.1
  locality f w := by
    refine ⟨P.locality f ?_, Q.locality f ?_⟩ <;>
      (intro x; have ⟨V, hV, i, h⟩ := w x; use V, hV, i)
    exacts [h.1, h.2]

/-- The local predicate of being a partial section of a function. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalPredicate/Variant61720cdf8f5b2df37106da0ec105c398203f5a4453ff3e5f9850e2e94cda6f97.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalPredicate/Variant61720cdf8f5b2df37106da0ec105c398203f5a4453ff3e5f9850e2e94cda6f97.lean#L134).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `97e256f8fa2cefc84ef7388743e9e8c7a712fba6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
