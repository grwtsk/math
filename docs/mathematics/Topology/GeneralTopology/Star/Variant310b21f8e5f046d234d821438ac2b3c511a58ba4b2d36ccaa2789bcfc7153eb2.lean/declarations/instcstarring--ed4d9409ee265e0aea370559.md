## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cecd28f8c44a2cc152d1bb63e05cd5526c2873fd1ab2dbf1543b47033145e95b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instCStarRing : CStarRing (α →ᵇ β) where
  norm_mul_self_le f := by
    rw [← sq, ← Real.le_sqrt (norm_nonneg _) (norm_nonneg _), norm_le (Real.sqrt_nonneg _)]
    intro x
    rw [Real.le_sqrt (norm_nonneg _) (norm_nonneg _), sq, ← CStarRing.norm_star_mul_self]
    exact norm_coe_le_norm (star f * f) x

end CStarRing

variable (𝕜 : Type*) [NormedField 𝕜] [TopologicalSpace α]
  [NormedRing β] [NormedAlgebra 𝕜 β] [StarAddMonoid β] [NormedStarGroup β]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Star/Variant310b21f8e5f046d234d821438ac2b3c511a58ba4b2d36ccaa2789bcfc7153eb2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Star/Variant310b21f8e5f046d234d821438ac2b3c511a58ba4b2d36ccaa2789bcfc7153eb2.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1e40cc3dd8981c4f54873218e8d5d0ec6b269354` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
