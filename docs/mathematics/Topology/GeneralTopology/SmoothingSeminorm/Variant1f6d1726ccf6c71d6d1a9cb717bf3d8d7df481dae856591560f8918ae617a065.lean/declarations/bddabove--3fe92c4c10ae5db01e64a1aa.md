## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3b5549f4-b281-6fd9-ac54-ace102d05724`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 332–338.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem μ_bddAbove' (hμ1 : μ 1 ≤ 1) {s : ℕ → ℕ} (hs : ∀ n : ℕ, s n ≤ n) (x : R)
    (ψ : ℕ → ℕ) : BddAbove ((fun n : ℕ => μ (x ^ s (ψ n)) ^ (1 / (ψ n : ℝ))) '' Set.univ) := by
  rw [Set.image_eq_range]
  convert μ_bddAbove μ hμ1 hs x ψ
  ext
  simp [one_div, Set.mem_range, Subtype.exists, Set.mem_univ, exists_const]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SmoothingSeminorm/Variant1f6d1726ccf6c71d6d1a9cb717bf3d8d7df481dae856591560f8918ae617a065.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SmoothingSeminorm/Variant1f6d1726ccf6c71d6d1a9cb717bf3d8d7df481dae856591560f8918ae617a065.lean#L332).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `78335489fe106e5b36b836341da5d119cb2a2e9a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
