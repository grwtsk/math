## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d2bac4f3-58a6-04f6-ec4c-30a83379fa45`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–80.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem leftLim_eq_of_tendsto [hα : TopologicalSpace α] [h'α : OrderTopology α] [T2Space β]
    {f : α → β} {a : α} {y : β} [h : (𝓝[<] a).NeBot] (h' : Tendsto f (𝓝[<] a) (𝓝 y)) :
    leftLim f a = y := by
  have h'' : ∃ y, Tendsto f (𝓝[<] a) (𝓝 y) := ⟨y, h'⟩
  rw [h'α.topology_eq_generate_intervals] at h h' h''
  simp only [leftLim, neBot_iff.mp h, h'', not_true, or_self_iff, ite_false]
  exact lim_eq h'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LeftRightLim/Variant04504feb4e28b6b46b739a4c1d095ca4310908998fba991b54cb995d9852f4d1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LeftRightLim/Variant04504feb4e28b6b46b739a4c1d095ca4310908998fba991b54cb995d9852f4d1.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a138060bebf654b31e51e47f85e50a17e2bb74ee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
