## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b7cfa34f-8485-ee6b-ab6d-e33c0c8d679e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–158.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  have A : ∀ᶠ n in p, g n ∈ s := hg sx
  have B : ∀ᶠ n in p, (f x, f (g n)) ∈ u₁ := hg (Uniform.continuousWithinAt_iff'_right.1 h h₁)
  exact B.mp <| A.mp <| hs.mono fun y H1 H2 H3 => u₁₀ (prodMk_mem_compRel H3 (H1 _ H2))

/-- If `Fₙ` converges locally uniformly on a neighborhood of `x` to a function `f` which is
continuous at `x`, and `gₙ` tends to `x`, then `Fₙ (gₙ)` tends to `f x`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformApproximation/Variant57ee086bce0eadb2e87eced3319ebcced604dab1e09d3726910754f859d07949.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformApproximation/Variant57ee086bce0eadb2e87eced3319ebcced604dab1e09d3726910754f859d07949.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ffe4857f13944738ecb809c042bb2cb6b3f49cb9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
