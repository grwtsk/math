## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1f1d4ac8-0c51-8367-5387-c969362104fa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 122–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Composing limits under uniform convergence

In general, if `Fₙ` converges pointwise to a function `f`, and `gₙ` tends to `x`, it is not true
that `Fₙ gₙ` tends to `f x`. It is true however if the convergence of `Fₙ` to `f` is uniform. In
this paragraph, we prove variations around this statement.
-/


/-- If `Fₙ` converges locally uniformly on a neighborhood of `x` within a set `s` to a function `f`
which is continuous at `x` within `s`, and `gₙ` tends to `x` within `s`, then `Fₙ (gₙ)` tends
to `f x`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformApproximation/Variante49433d80f69b92eaeacfbb00e1090bba0d7cc14345fba78e203c8fc3013483a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformApproximation/Variante49433d80f69b92eaeacfbb00e1090bba0d7cc14345fba78e203c8fc3013483a.lean#L122).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d6e8341515dd8ed2978f40a54d4141d1a9c294ef` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
