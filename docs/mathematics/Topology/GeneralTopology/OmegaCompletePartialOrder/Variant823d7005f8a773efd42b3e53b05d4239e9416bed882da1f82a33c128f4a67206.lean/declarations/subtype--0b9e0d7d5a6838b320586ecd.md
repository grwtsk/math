## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c8fcba8adebc740490eea9f1378cc170b9bdc50272136b86e99c2388091435ad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 245–264.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def subtype {α : Type*} [OmegaCompletePartialOrder α] (p : α → Prop)
    (hp : ∀ c : Chain α, (∀ i ∈ c, p i) → p (ωSup c)) : OmegaCompletePartialOrder (Subtype p) :=
  OmegaCompletePartialOrder.lift (OrderHom.Subtype.val p)
    (fun c => ⟨ωSup _, hp (c.map (OrderHom.Subtype.val p)) fun _ ⟨n, q⟩ => q.symm ▸ (c n).2⟩)
    (fun _ _ h => h) (fun _ => rfl)

section Continuity

open Chain

variable [OmegaCompletePartialOrder β]
variable [OmegaCompletePartialOrder γ]

/-- A monotone function `f : α →o β` is continuous if it distributes over ωSup.

In order to distinguish it from the (more commonly used) continuity from topology
(see `Mathlib/Topology/Basic.lean`), the present definition is often referred to as
"Scott-continuity" (referring to Dana Scott). It corresponds to continuity
in Scott topological spaces (not defined here). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/OmegaCompletePartialOrder/Variant823d7005f8a773efd42b3e53b05d4239e9416bed882da1f82a33c128f4a67206.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/OmegaCompletePartialOrder/Variant823d7005f8a773efd42b3e53b05d4239e9416bed882da1f82a33c128f4a67206.lean#L245).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a61cda59f861e627e095c95b94074e82194c9ad4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
