## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f8999ed4-6652-3a54-6724-aec6462b6dd1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 373–378.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Monotone.map_iInf_of_continuousAt {ι : Sort*} {f : α → β} {g : ι → α}
    (Cf : ContinuousAt f (iInf g)) (Mf : Monotone f) (ftop : f ⊤ = ⊤) : f (iInf g) = iInf (f ∘ g) :=
  Monotone.map_iSup_of_continuousAt (α := αᵒᵈ) (β := βᵒᵈ) Cf Mf.dual ftop

/-- An antitone function `f` sending `bot` to `top` and continuous at the supremum of a set sends
this supremum to the infimum of the image of this set. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Monotone/Variantf42a57bf01dfe242cecc96ee8805a64a43985958b1f70f49fa231410e42cd585.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Monotone/Variantf42a57bf01dfe242cecc96ee8805a64a43985958b1f70f49fa231410e42cd585.lean#L373).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1409839fd48f7ef033ac6eaefa7c52a22a1c5bc0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
