## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6b2e9130e3280baec48dd051c6fabd2f2199778f352a4922f0b480c9c4773e8d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 64–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class ZeroAtInftyContinuousMapClass (F : Type*) (α β : outParam Type*) [TopologicalSpace α]
    [Zero β] [TopologicalSpace β] [FunLike F α β] : Prop extends ContinuousMapClass F α β where
  /-- Each member of the class tends to zero along the `cocompact` filter. -/
  zero_at_infty (f : F) : Tendsto f (cocompact α) (𝓝 0)

end

export ZeroAtInftyContinuousMapClass (zero_at_infty)

namespace ZeroAtInftyContinuousMap

section Basics

variable [TopologicalSpace β] [Zero β] [FunLike F α β] [ZeroAtInftyContinuousMapClass F α β]

@[macro_inline]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ZeroAtInfty/Variant64563bf4bdecb8eae7f53ea140926f7a60e75b9507d3784011924d7b6c8e4169.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ZeroAtInfty/Variant64563bf4bdecb8eae7f53ea140926f7a60e75b9507d3784011924d7b6c8e4169.lean#L64).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6f79b9219f4bdf77ba4f929d6bab7b66539c77b0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
