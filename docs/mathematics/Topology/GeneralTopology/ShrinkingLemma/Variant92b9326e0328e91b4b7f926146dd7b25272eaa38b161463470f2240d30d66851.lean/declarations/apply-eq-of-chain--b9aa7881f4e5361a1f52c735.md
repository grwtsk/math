## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2e1e5df6-b594-a7ff-34c7-963033784c45`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 99–105.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem apply_eq_of_chain {c : Set (PartialRefinement u s p)} (hc : IsChain (· ≤ ·) c) {v₁ v₂}
    (h₁ : v₁ ∈ c) (h₂ : v₂ ∈ c) {i} (hi₁ : i ∈ v₁.carrier) (hi₂ : i ∈ v₂.carrier) :
    v₁ i = v₂ i :=
  (hc.total h₁ h₂).elim (fun hle => hle.2 _ hi₁) (fun hle => (hle.2 _ hi₂).symm)

/-- The carrier of the least upper bound of a non-empty chain of partial refinements is the union of
their carriers. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ShrinkingLemma/Variant92b9326e0328e91b4b7f926146dd7b25272eaa38b161463470f2240d30d66851.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ShrinkingLemma/Variant92b9326e0328e91b4b7f926146dd7b25272eaa38b161463470f2240d30d66851.lean#L99).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f2eee98655cba0c53c083594411994eefe9106b9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
