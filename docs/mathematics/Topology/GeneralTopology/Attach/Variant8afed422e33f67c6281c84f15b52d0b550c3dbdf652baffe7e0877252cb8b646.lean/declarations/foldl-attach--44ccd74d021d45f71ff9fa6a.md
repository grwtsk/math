## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ebd82397-46bf-a300-3a00-e88654e80f4c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 346–364.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem foldl_attach {xs : Array α} {f : β → α → β} {b : β} :
    xs.attach.foldl (fun acc t => f acc t.1) b = xs.foldl f b := by
  rcases xs with ⟨xs⟩
  simp only [List.attach_toArray, List.attachWith_mem_toArray, List.size_toArray,
    List.foldl_toArray', List.mem_toArray, List.foldl_subtype]

/--
If we fold over `l.attach` with a function that ignores the membership predicate,
we get the same results as folding over `l` directly.

This is useful when we need to use `attach` to show termination.

Unfortunately this can't be applied by `simp` because of the higher order unification problem,
and even when rewriting we need to specify the function explicitly.
See however `foldr_subtype` below.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Attach/Variant8afed422e33f67c6281c84f15b52d0b550c3dbdf652baffe7e0877252cb8b646.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Attach/Variant8afed422e33f67c6281c84f15b52d0b550c3dbdf652baffe7e0877252cb8b646.lean#L346).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `476cbde4449e31979885f46854ba887cc560f694` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
