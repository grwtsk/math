## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c52bec18edb589bd6c08a9ee998cf0af89fe102e23f5e56f0eb91f19b6e78738`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–58.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[implemented_by attachWithImpl, expose] def attachWith
    (xs : Array α) (P : α → Prop) (H : ∀ x ∈ xs, P x) : Array {x // P x} :=
  ⟨xs.toList.attachWith P fun x h => H x (Array.Mem.mk h)⟩

/--
“Attaches” the proof that the elements of `xs` are in fact elements of `xs`, producing a new array with
the same elements but in the subtype `{ x // x ∈ xs }`.

`O(1)`.

This function is primarily used to allow definitions by [well-founded
recursion](lean-manual://section/well-founded-recursion) that use higher-order functions (such as
`Array.map`) to prove that an value taken from a list is smaller than the list. This allows the
well-founded recursion mechanism to prove that the function terminates.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Attach/Variant3a4ab48b28c6ef486431ba32dabe800716c5277d101335492834bd66de705c63.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Attach/Variant3a4ab48b28c6ef486431ba32dabe800716c5277d101335492834bd66de705c63.lean#L44).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9502589a50e673c3faefbb7f95b349514d6ed257` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
