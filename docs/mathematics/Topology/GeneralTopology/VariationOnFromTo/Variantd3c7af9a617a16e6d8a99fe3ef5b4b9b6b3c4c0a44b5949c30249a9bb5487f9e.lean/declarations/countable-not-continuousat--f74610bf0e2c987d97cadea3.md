## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6e8f4729-c820-61c7-d54a-0998ccd725df`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 364–377.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem countable_not_continuousAt (hf : BoundedVariationOn g univ) :
    Set.Countable {x | ¬ ContinuousAt g x} := by
  nontriviality α
  inhabit α
  simp only [← hf.continuousAt_variationOnFromTo_iff default]
  apply Monotone.countable_not_continuousAt
  rw [← monotoneOn_univ]
  exact variationOnFromTo.monotoneOn hf.locallyBoundedVariationOn (mem_univ _)

end BoundedVariationOn

/-- If a real-valued function has bounded variation on a set, then it is a difference of monotone
functions there. Moreover, one can make sure that the two monotone functions add up to the
variation of `f`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/VariationOnFromTo/Variantd3c7af9a617a16e6d8a99fe3ef5b4b9b6b3c4c0a44b5949c30249a9bb5487f9e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/VariationOnFromTo/Variantd3c7af9a617a16e6d8a99fe3ef5b4b9b6b3c4c0a44b5949c30249a9bb5487f9e.lean#L364).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8f9fd68d4e094bdd90370796d90ad12605cb8497` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
