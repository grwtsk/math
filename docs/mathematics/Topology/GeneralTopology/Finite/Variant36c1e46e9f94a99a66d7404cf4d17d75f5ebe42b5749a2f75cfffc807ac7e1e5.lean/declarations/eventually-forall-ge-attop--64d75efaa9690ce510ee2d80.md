## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7618b98c-e060-0de9-1ba7-5e2b92f6f0f0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 31–38.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eventually_forall_ge_atTop [Preorder α] {p : α → Prop} :
    (∀ᶠ x in atTop, ∀ y, x ≤ y → p y) ↔ ∀ᶠ x in atTop, p x := by
  refine ⟨fun h ↦ h.mono fun x hx ↦ hx x le_rfl, fun h ↦ ?_⟩
  rcases (hasBasis_iInf_principal_finite _).eventually_iff.1 h with ⟨S, hSf, hS⟩
  refine mem_iInf_of_iInter hSf (V := fun x ↦ Ici x.1) (fun _ ↦ Subset.rfl) fun x hx y hy ↦ ?_
  simp only [mem_iInter] at hS hx
  exact hS fun z hz ↦ le_trans (hx ⟨z, hz⟩) hy

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Finite/Variant36c1e46e9f94a99a66d7404cf4d17d75f5ebe42b5749a2f75cfffc807ac7e1e5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Finite/Variant36c1e46e9f94a99a66d7404cf4d17d75f5ebe42b5749a2f75cfffc807ac7e1e5.lean#L31).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c6afa688a56cc8a6fc39893b4a5fa642d5709aa6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
