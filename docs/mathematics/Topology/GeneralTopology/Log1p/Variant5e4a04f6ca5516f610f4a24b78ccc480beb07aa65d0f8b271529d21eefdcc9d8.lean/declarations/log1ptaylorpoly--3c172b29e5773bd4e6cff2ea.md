## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:65758564d68f47c7254c00da89b05a2a601e2d92aad2b384f9ac00ec41aefc62`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 64–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def log1pTaylorPoly (n : ℕ) : Polynomial ℚ :=
  ∑ i ∈ Finset.range (n + 1), Polynomial.C (log1pTaylorCoeffs n i) * Polynomial.X ^ i

/-- Lagrange remainder bound for log(1+x) Taylor series centered at 0.
    The (n+1)th derivative of log(1+x) is (-1)^n · n! / (1+x)^(n+1).
    For the Taylor expansion at center 0, ξ lies between 0 and z:
    - If z ≥ 0: ξ ∈ [0, z], so min(1+ξ) = 1
    - If z < 0: ξ ∈ [z, 0], so min(1+ξ) = 1+z ≥ 1+lo
    Overall minimum is min(1, 1+lo).
    |R_n(x)| ≤ |x|^(n+1) / [(n+1) · min(1, 1+lo)^(n+1)] -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Log1p/Variant5e4a04f6ca5516f610f4a24b78ccc480beb07aa65d0f8b271529d21eefdcc9d8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Log1p/Variant5e4a04f6ca5516f610f4a24b78ccc480beb07aa65d0f8b271529d21eefdcc9d8.lean#L64).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `df3e65c8dd9dbebb0789dc64dc85a6a1e594bec5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
