## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a7320452-9d98-43c8-cfec-2eb08ac61efa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 132–142.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem iteratedDeriv_log1p {n : ℕ} (hn : n ≠ 0) {y : ℝ} (hy : -1 < y) :
    iteratedDeriv n (fun x => Real.log (1 + x)) y = ((-1 : ℝ)^(n - 1)) * (n - 1).factorial * (1 + y)^(-(n : ℤ)) := by
  have h1py_pos : 0 < 1 + y := by linarith
  -- Use iteratedDeriv_comp_const_add: iteratedDeriv n (f ∘ (c + ·)) = iteratedDeriv n f (c + ·)
  have hchain : iteratedDeriv n (fun x => Real.log (1 + x)) y = iteratedDeriv n Real.log (1 + y) := by
    have h := iteratedDeriv_comp_const_add n Real.log 1
    exact congrFun h y
  rw [hchain]
  exact LeanCert.Core.iteratedDeriv_log hn h1py_pos

/-- At x = 0, the n-th derivative of log(1+x) is (-1)^(n-1) * (n-1)!. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Log1p/Variant97370675a9327a6f3de4b8ee3de3c85da8524f43365148b77eeef5c794a8f0c6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Log1p/Variant97370675a9327a6f3de4b8ee3de3c85da8524f43365148b77eeef5c794a8f0c6.lean#L132).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bf9e8892b67e403f0ebaf17412bc3ebafbeb336d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
