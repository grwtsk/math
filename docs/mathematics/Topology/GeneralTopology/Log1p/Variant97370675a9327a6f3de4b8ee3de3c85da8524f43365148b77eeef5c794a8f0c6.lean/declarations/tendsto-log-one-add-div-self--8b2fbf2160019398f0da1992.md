## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5f3bf435-e926-66b4-f660-50e6478a0711`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 386–399.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_log_one_add_div_self :
    Filter.Tendsto (fun t => Real.log (1 + t) / t) (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0)) (nhds 1) := by
  -- Follows from log'(1) = 1 via hasDerivAt_iff_tendsto_slope_zero
  -- (log(1+t) - log(1))/t = log(1+t)/t → 1 as t → 0
  have hderiv : HasDerivAt Real.log 1 1 := by
    have h := Real.hasDerivAt_log (one_ne_zero)
    simp only [inv_one] at h
    exact h
  have htendsto := hderiv.tendsto_slope_zero_right
  -- htendsto: Tendsto (fun t => t⁻¹ • (log(1 + t) - log 1)) (𝓝[>] 0) (𝓝 1)
  simp only [Real.log_one, sub_zero, smul_eq_mul, inv_mul_eq_div] at htendsto
  exact htendsto

/-- Helper: log(1-t)/t → -1 as t → 0⁺. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Log1p/Variant97370675a9327a6f3de4b8ee3de3c85da8524f43365148b77eeef5c794a8f0c6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Log1p/Variant97370675a9327a6f3de4b8ee3de3c85da8524f43365148b77eeef5c794a8f0c6.lean#L386).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bf9e8892b67e403f0ebaf17412bc3ebafbeb336d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
