## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:091ff3d2-5765-45b6-92da-b071ef8f8631`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 124–136.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem adjointDomainMkCLMExtend_apply (hT : Dense (T.domain : Set E)) (y : T.adjointDomain)
    (x : T.domain) : adjointDomainMkCLMExtend T y (x : E) = ⟪(y : F), T x⟫ :=
  ContinuousLinearMap.extend_eq _ hT.denseRange_val
    isUniformEmbedding_subtype_val.isUniformInducing _

variable [CompleteSpace E]

variable (hT : Dense (T.domain : Set E))

/-- The adjoint as a linear map from its domain to `E`.

This is an auxiliary definition needed to define the adjoint operator as a `LinearPMap` without
the assumption that `T.domain` is dense. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LinearPMap/Variant946206e3b9a95f9726e1e87eefa3b9382efa10c3be68ec7e246281713427920d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LinearPMap/Variant946206e3b9a95f9726e1e87eefa3b9382efa10c3be68ec7e246281713427920d.lean#L124).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `50f779fc52ac4d50d98dec46ec3cbd4bdd3108d9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
