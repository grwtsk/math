## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4792c87a-b90b-b561-fb05-15276135c7c0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 606–615.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem topologicalSpace_eq_iSup :
    topologicalSpace R A 𝓕 = ⨆ (S : Set ι) (hS : 𝓕 ≤ 𝓟 S),
      .coinduced (inclusion R A hS) (topologicalSpace R A (𝓟 S)) := by
  simp_rw [topologicalSpace_eq_of_principal, topologicalSpace]

/-- The **universal property** of the topology on the restricted product: a map from
`Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓕]` is continuous *iff* its restriction to each `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 s]`
(with `𝓕 ≤ 𝓟 s`) is continuous.

See also `RestrictedProduct.continuous_dom_prod_left`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/RestrictedProduct/Variant14ae14c355d2251c56a03d3b4ad0fc341b96e46177242d1475b8166208be8929.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/RestrictedProduct/Variant14ae14c355d2251c56a03d3b4ad0fc341b96e46177242d1475b8166208be8929.lean#L606).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `18b3a7bb3cd2e819fddd5ed78049567f5330d914` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
