## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f73f94d6-1cba-9a70-5444-2f5b7c45891f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 630–655.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem isEmbedding_structureMap :
    IsEmbedding (structureMap R A 𝓕) :=
  isEmbedding_inclusion_top.comp homeoTop.isEmbedding

end general

section cofinite
/-!
### Topological facts in the case where `𝓕 = cofinite` and all `A i`s are open

The classical restricted product, associated to the cofinite filter, satisfies more topological
properties when each `A i` is an open subset of `R i`. The key fact is that each
`Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 S]` (with `S` cofinite) then embeds **as an open subset** in
`Πʳ i, [R i, A i]`.

This allows us to prove a "universal property with parameters", expressing that for any
arbitrary topolgical space `X` (of "parameters"), the product `X × Πʳ i, [R i, A i]`
is still the inductive limit of the `X × Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[𝓟 S]` for `S` cofinite.

This fact, which is **not true** for a general inductive limit, will allow us to prove continuity
of functions of two variables (e.g algebraic operations), which would otherwise be inaccessible.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/RestrictedProduct/Variant14ae14c355d2251c56a03d3b4ad0fc341b96e46177242d1475b8166208be8929.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/RestrictedProduct/Variant14ae14c355d2251c56a03d3b4ad0fc341b96e46177242d1475b8166208be8929.lean#L630).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `18b3a7bb3cd2e819fddd5ed78049567f5330d914` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
