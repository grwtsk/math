## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1fdfef19-6f36-7bae-d030-339c90705922`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 396–413.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma mapMonoidHom_apply (x : Πʳ i, [R₁ i, B₁ i]_[𝓕₁]) (j : ι₂) :
    x.mapMonoidHom R₁ R₂ f hf φ hφ j = φ j (x (f j)) :=
  rfl

end monoid

section ring

variable [Π i, Ring (R₁ i)] [Π i, Ring (R₂ i)] [∀ i, SubringClass (S₁ i) (R₁ i)]
    [∀ i, SubringClass (S₂ i) (R₂ i)] (φ : ∀ j, R₁ (f j) →+* R₂ j)
    (hφ : ∀ᶠ j in 𝓕₂, Set.MapsTo (φ j) (B₁ (f j)) (B₂ j))

/--
Given two restricted products `Πʳ (i : ι₁), [R₁ i, B₁ i]_[𝓕₁]` and `Πʳ (j : ι₂), [R₂ j, B₂ j]_[𝓕₂]`,
`RestrictedProduct.mapRingHom` gives a ring homomorphism between them. The data needed is a
function `f : ι₂ → ι₁` such that `𝓕₂` tends to `𝓕₁` along `f`, and ring homomorphisms
`φ j : R₁ (f j) → R₂ j` sending `B₁ (f j)` into `B₂ j` for an `𝓕₂`-large set of `j`'s.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/RestrictedProduct/Variant14ae14c355d2251c56a03d3b4ad0fc341b96e46177242d1475b8166208be8929.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/RestrictedProduct/Variant14ae14c355d2251c56a03d3b4ad0fc341b96e46177242d1475b8166208be8929.lean#L396).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `18b3a7bb3cd2e819fddd5ed78049567f5330d914` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
