## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:02ff9afaa799370ac730fec9f6f5ffe78d126909cfd6e8f0e905151a2b2a18e9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 534–544.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def homeoTop : (Π i, A i) ≃ₜ (Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[⊤]) where
  toFun f := ⟨fun i ↦ f i, fun i ↦ (f i).2⟩
  invFun f i := ⟨f i, f.2 i⟩
  continuous_toFun := continuous_rng_of_top.mpr <| continuous_pi fun i ↦
      continuous_subtype_val.comp <| continuous_apply i
  continuous_invFun := continuous_pi fun i ↦ continuous_induced_rng.mpr <|
    (continuous_apply i).comp continuous_coe
  left_inv _ := rfl
  right_inv _ := rfl

/-- The obvious bijection between `Πʳ i, [R i, A i]_[⊥]` and `Π i, R i` is a homeomorphism. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/RestrictedProduct/Variant01db49eaad65048854b9fac73af65a69691125872206af78ff3fab8b927ec97b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/RestrictedProduct/Variant01db49eaad65048854b9fac73af65a69691125872206af78ff3fab8b927ec97b.lean#L534).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b86d294c7d72ed8ed1fe13050939547dd635c170` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
