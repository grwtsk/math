## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:def5ef46b69bb31c399d722831bde24a330fc9260417720fe166a0da4dfdc056`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 298–302.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def compactConvergenceUniformity : Filter (C(α, β) × C(α, β)) :=
  ⨅ KV ∈ { KV : Set α × Set (β × β) | IsCompact KV.1 ∧ KV.2 ∈ 𝓤 β },
    𝓟 { fg : C(α, β) × C(α, β) | ∀ x : α, x ∈ KV.1 → (fg.1 x, fg.2 x) ∈ KV.2 }
#align continuous_map.compact_convergence_uniformity ContinuousMap.compactConvergenceUniformity

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactConvergence/Variant0585a3a69bbc0029e5e5f601dd900800511b1fb94632b2f123b2cb93e242fbd9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactConvergence/Variant0585a3a69bbc0029e5e5f601dd900800511b1fb94632b2f123b2cb93e242fbd9.lean#L298).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0788ac245737c102988379e8f3697a91ffdef77f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
