## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b3d36fbd-c50e-4177-c469-62eafba3b307`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 324–330.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_iff_tendstoUniformly :
    Tendsto F p (𝓝 f) ↔ TendstoUniformly (fun i a => F i a) f p := by
  rw [tendsto_iff_forall_isCompact_tendstoUniformlyOn, ← tendstoUniformlyOn_univ]
  exact ⟨fun h => h univ isCompact_univ, fun h K _hK => h.mono (subset_univ K)⟩

end CompactDomain

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactConvergence/Variant874a4b9e978e648ac5b38308ab9b11d86509c6cc35ea9a6fdf38a6114f1fd3e0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactConvergence/Variant874a4b9e978e648ac5b38308ab9b11d86509c6cc35ea9a6fdf38a6114f1fd3e0.lean#L324).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `158e3b258505957369d11e6c01e7e4979aa586bf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
