## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c238bf2d0d667616db8ad10ef76c5d9dd35575beb22abf1278a2235eaf3d26be`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 186–198.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [UCompactlyGeneratedSpace.{u} X] [UCompactlyGeneratedSpace.{v} Y] :
    UCompactlyGeneratedSpace.{max u v} (X ⊕ Y) := by
  refine uCompactlyGeneratedSpace_of_isClosed fun s h ↦ isClosed_sum_iff.2 ⟨?_, ?_⟩
  all_goals
    refine UCompactlyGeneratedSpace.isClosed fun S ⟨f, hf⟩ ↦ ?_
  · let g : ULift.{v} S → X ⊕ Y := Sum.inl ∘ f ∘ ULift.down
    have hg : Continuous g := continuous_inl.comp <| hf.comp continuous_uliftDown
    exact (h ↧(ULift.{v} S) ⟨g, hg⟩).preimage continuous_uliftUp
  · let g : ULift.{u} S → X ⊕ Y := Sum.inr ∘ f ∘ ULift.down
    have hg : Continuous g := continuous_inr.comp <| hf.comp continuous_uliftDown
    exact (h ↧(ULift.{u} S) ⟨g, hg⟩).preimage continuous_uliftUp

/-- The sigma type associated to a family of compactly generated spaces is compactly generated. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactlyGeneratedSpace/Variant9ae56551206ea8cd9ed623f88155d17503546bc1e46f4942e7d3010fbf424121.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactlyGeneratedSpace/Variant9ae56551206ea8cd9ed623f88155d17503546bc1e46f4942e7d3010fbf424121.lean#L186).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6937be976453441d26c55e790be5352ece73834b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
