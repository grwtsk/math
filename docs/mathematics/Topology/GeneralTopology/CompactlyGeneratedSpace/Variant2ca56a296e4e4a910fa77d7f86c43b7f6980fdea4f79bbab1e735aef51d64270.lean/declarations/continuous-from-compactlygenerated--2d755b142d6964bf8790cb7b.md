## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:844ebcc8-56a6-6849-17e9-2c4679ac5891`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (h : ∀ (S : CompHaus.{u}) (g : C(S, X)), Continuous (f ∘ g)) :
        Continuous[compactlyGenerated.{u} X, t] f := by
  rw [continuous_coinduced_dom]
  continuity

/--
A topological space `X` is compactly generated if its topology is finer than (and thus equal to)
the compactly generated topology, i.e. it is coinduced by the continuous maps from compact
Hausdorff spaces to `X`.

This version includes an explicit universe parameter `u` which should always be specified. It is
intended for categorical purposes. See `CompactlyGeneratedSpace` for the version without this
parameter, intended for topological purposes.
-/
-- After https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12286 and
-- https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/12423, the compact space universe `u` would default
-- to a universe output parameter. See Note [universe output parameters and typeclass caching].

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactlyGeneratedSpace/Variant2ca56a296e4e4a910fa77d7f86c43b7f6980fdea4f79bbab1e735aef51d64270.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactlyGeneratedSpace/Variant2ca56a296e4e4a910fa77d7f86c43b7f6980fdea4f79bbab1e735aef51d64270.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `174bec8e0ce88826c0d21979b4b70f3e2b9dde9e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
