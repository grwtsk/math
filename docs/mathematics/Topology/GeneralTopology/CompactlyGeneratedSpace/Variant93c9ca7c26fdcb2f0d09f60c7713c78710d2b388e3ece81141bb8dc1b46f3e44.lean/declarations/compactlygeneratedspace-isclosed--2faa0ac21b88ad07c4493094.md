## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bb4a0bdf-62e1-3306-78a3-8672520596ff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 276–283.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem CompactlyGeneratedSpace.isClosed [CompactlyGeneratedSpace X] {s : Set X}
    (hs : ∀ ⦃K⦄, IsCompact K → IsClosed (s ∩ K)) : IsClosed s := by
  refine isClosed' fun K _ _ _ f hf ↦ ?_
  rw [← Set.preimage_inter_range]
  exact (hs (isCompact_range hf)).preimage hf

/-- A topological space `X` is compactly generated if a set `s` is open when `f ⁻¹' s` is
open for every continuous map `f : K → X`, where `K` is compact Hausdorff. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactlyGeneratedSpace/Variant93c9ca7c26fdcb2f0d09f60c7713c78710d2b388e3ece81141bb8dc1b46f3e44.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactlyGeneratedSpace/Variant93c9ca7c26fdcb2f0d09f60c7713c78710d2b388e3ece81141bb8dc1b46f3e44.lean#L276).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d3d32971837ad75ce581df1c767f199fede62fa3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
