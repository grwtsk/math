## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dd67163d-e094-db14-4bd2-41b63a438dfb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 112–131.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma uCompactlyGeneratedSpace_of_continuous_maps [t : TopologicalSpace X]
    (h : ∀ {Y : Type w} [tY : TopologicalSpace Y] (f : X → Y),
      (∀ (S : CompHaus.{u}) (g : C(S, X)), Continuous (f ∘ g)) → Continuous f) :
        UCompactlyGeneratedSpace.{u} X where
  le_compactlyGenerated := by
    suffices Continuous[t, compactlyGenerated.{u} X] (id : X → X) by
      rwa [← continuous_id_iff_le]
    apply h (tY := compactlyGenerated.{u} X)
    intro S g
    let f : (Σ (i : (T : CompHaus.{u}) × C(T, X)), i.fst) → X := fun ⟨⟨_, i⟩, s⟩ ↦ i s
    suffices ∀ (i : (T : CompHaus.{u}) × C(T, X)),
      Continuous[inferInstance, compactlyGenerated X] (fun (a : i.fst) ↦ f ⟨i, a⟩) from this ⟨S, g⟩
    rw [← @continuous_sigma_iff]
    apply continuous_coinduced_rng

variable [tX : TopologicalSpace X] [tY : TopologicalSpace Y]

/-- If `X` is compactly generated, to prove that `f : X → Y` is continuous it is enough to show
that for every compact Hausdorff space `K` and every continuous map `g : K → X`,
`f ∘ g` is continuous. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactlyGeneratedSpace/Variant93c9ca7c26fdcb2f0d09f60c7713c78710d2b388e3ece81141bb8dc1b46f3e44.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactlyGeneratedSpace/Variant93c9ca7c26fdcb2f0d09f60c7713c78710d2b388e3ece81141bb8dc1b46f3e44.lean#L112).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d3d32971837ad75ce581df1c767f199fede62fa3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
