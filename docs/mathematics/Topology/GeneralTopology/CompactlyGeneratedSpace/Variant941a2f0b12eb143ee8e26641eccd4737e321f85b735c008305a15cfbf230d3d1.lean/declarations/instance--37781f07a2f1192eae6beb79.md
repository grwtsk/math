## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:94c327619264f003e075ffe74ea996bb9ec57d7b99da8083977941f2d78ac12d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 305–315.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {ι : Type u} {X : ι → Type v}
    [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)] [∀ i, CompactlyGeneratedSpace (X i)] :
    CompactlyGeneratedSpace (Σ i, X i) := by
  refine compactlyGeneratedSpace_of_isClosed fun s h ↦ isClosed_sigma_iff.2 fun i ↦
    CompactlyGeneratedSpace.isClosed' fun K _ _ _ f hf ↦ ?_
  let g : ULift.{u} K → (Σ i, X i) := Sigma.mk i ∘ f ∘ ULift.down
  have hg : Continuous g := continuous_sigmaMk.comp <| hf.comp continuous_uliftDown
  exact (h _ g hg).preimage continuous_uliftUp

variable [T2Space X]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactlyGeneratedSpace/Variant941a2f0b12eb143ee8e26641eccd4737e321f85b735c008305a15cfbf230d3d1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactlyGeneratedSpace/Variant941a2f0b12eb143ee8e26641eccd4737e321f85b735c008305a15cfbf230d3d1.lean#L305).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `32039f2cc8000d4d6a2ac875271bedbdfbe3019d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
