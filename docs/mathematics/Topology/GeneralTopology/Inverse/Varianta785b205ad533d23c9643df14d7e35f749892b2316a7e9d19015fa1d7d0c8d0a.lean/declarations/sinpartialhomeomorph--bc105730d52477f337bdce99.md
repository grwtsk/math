## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3c61536cc65f795d0558f3d6111933210a986122428bd5c170aadebc8daceec5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 248–261.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def sinPartialHomeomorph : PartialHomeomorph ℝ ℝ where
  toFun := sin
  invFun := arcsin
  source := Ioo (-(π / 2)) (π / 2)
  target := Ioo (-1) 1
  map_source' := mapsTo_sin_Ioo
  map_target' _ hy := ⟨neg_pi_div_two_lt_arcsin.2 hy.1, arcsin_lt_pi_div_two.2 hy.2⟩
  left_inv' _ hx := arcsin_sin hx.1.le hx.2.le
  right_inv' _ hy := sin_arcsin hy.1.le hy.2.le
  open_source := isOpen_Ioo
  open_target := isOpen_Ioo
  continuousOn_toFun := continuous_sin.continuousOn
  continuousOn_invFun := continuous_arcsin.continuousOn

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Inverse/Varianta785b205ad533d23c9643df14d7e35f749892b2316a7e9d19015fa1d7d0c8d0a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Inverse/Varianta785b205ad533d23c9643df14d7e35f749892b2316a7e9d19015fa1d7d0c8d0a.lean#L248).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dbab83c2c442469a08fd6eba27d981722fa75992` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
