## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c92a20d4-9b02-d80d-41be-dc2889f52f52`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 80–85.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem actual_integer_span_eq (A : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    Submodule.span ℂ (range (actualIntegerOrbit A hA)) =
      Submodule.span ℂ (range (integerOrbit A hA)) :=
  span_range_eq (fun n : {n : ℕ // 0 < n} => (n.val : ℝ))
    (fun n => by exact_mod_cast n.property) (actualComplexL2 A hA)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UnnormalizedDilationAttempt02/Variantbe417d077bc8da60fd925d17ef6fe794dc4b14fe318bbfcb8831c23166b0c4e9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UnnormalizedDilationAttempt02/Variantbe417d077bc8da60fd925d17ef6fe794dc4b14fe318bbfcb8831c23166b0c4e9.lean#L80).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `728e144570da1221cebb6e9b4a40c414e55977e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
