## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cb90bd55-768d-a449-92f8-c71da184d22b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 126–146.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Iter.step_mapWithPostcondition {f : β → PostconditionT n γ}
    [Monad n] [LawfulMonad n] :
  (it.mapWithPostcondition f).step = (do
    match it.step with
    | .yield it' out h => do
      let out' ← (f out).operation
      pure <| .deflate <| .yield (it'.mapWithPostcondition f) out'.1 (.yieldSome h ⟨out', rfl⟩)
    | .skip it' h =>
      pure <| .deflate <| .skip (it'.mapWithPostcondition f) (.skip h)
    | .done h =>
      pure <| .deflate <| .done (.done h)) := by
  simp only [mapWithPostcondition_eq_toIter_mapWithPostcondition_toIterM, IterM.step_mapWithPostcondition, step]
  simp only [liftM, monadLift, pure_bind]
  generalize it.toIterM.step = step
  match step.inflate with
  | .yield it' out h =>
    simp only [bind_pure_comp]
    rfl
  | .skip it' h => rfl
  | .done h => rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/FilterMap/Variant6541c9e1081f1f1605736b6886edea841e64c7f34347bdadfb29306fa7bdf979.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/FilterMap/Variant6541c9e1081f1f1605736b6886edea841e64c7f34347bdadfb29306fa7bdf979.lean#L126).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d815c3bd8873c023b5eaadb78aa6c51806910ecf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
