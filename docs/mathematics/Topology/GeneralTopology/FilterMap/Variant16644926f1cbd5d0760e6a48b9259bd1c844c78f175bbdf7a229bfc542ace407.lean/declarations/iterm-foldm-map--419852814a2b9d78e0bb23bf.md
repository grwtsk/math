## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:992ba7f6-9e96-7e27-88ff-f648dcd398b2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1502–1510.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IterM.foldM_map {α β γ δ : Type w} {m : Type w → Type w'} {n : Type w → Type w''}
    [Iterator α m β] [Finite α m] [Monad m] [Monad n] [LawfulMonad m] [LawfulMonad n]
    [IteratorLoop α m n] [LawfulIteratorLoop α m n]
    [MonadLiftT m n] [LawfulMonadLiftT m n]
    {f : β → γ} {g : δ → γ → n δ} {init : δ} {it : IterM (α := α) m β} :
    (it.map f).foldM (init := init) g =
      it.foldM (init := init) (fun d b => do g d (f b)) := by
  simp [foldM_eq_forIn, forIn_map]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/FilterMap/Variant16644926f1cbd5d0760e6a48b9259bd1c844c78f175bbdf7a229bfc542ace407.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/FilterMap/Variant16644926f1cbd5d0760e6a48b9259bd1c844c78f175bbdf7a229bfc542ace407.lean#L1502).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2d9f20680a123ddbd21d6deb3e478fa83d8e6191` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
