## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:50100a894f6724daee9281b227443c60e8213d033fb56161cafe6c1f3826291d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 162–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def galGroupBasis (K L : Type*) [Field K] [Field L] [Algebra K L] :
    GroupFilterBasis (L ≃ₐ[K] L) where
  toFilterBasis := galBasis K L
  one' := fun ⟨H, _, h2⟩ => h2 ▸ H.one_mem
  mul' {U} hU :=
    ⟨U, hU, by
      rcases hU with ⟨H, _, rfl⟩
      rintro x ⟨a, b, haH, hbH, rfl⟩

  inv' {U} hU :=
    ⟨U, hU, by
      rcases hU with ⟨H, _, rfl⟩
      exact fun _ => H.inv_mem'⟩
  conj' := by
    rintro σ U ⟨H, ⟨E, hE, rfl⟩, rfl⟩
    let F : IntermediateField K L := E.map σ.symm.toAlgHom

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/KrullTopology/Variantb2ffdd25fd39f4111700ab7aa42cf1788c9316a5fffaeaa9c37e9808726e2213.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/KrullTopology/Variantb2ffdd25fd39f4111700ab7aa42cf1788c9316a5fffaeaa9c37e9808726e2213.lean#L162).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7fa2e693e3125639c857d33a190d84f73a2d5559` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
