## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d0b9ecca-39b8-2876-9bfd-6493a9845bb1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 134–139.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IntermediateField.mem_fixingSubgroup_iff {K L : Type*} [Field K] [Field L] [Algebra K L]
    (E : IntermediateField K L) (σ : L ≃ₐ[K] L) : σ ∈ E.fixingSubgroup ↔ ∀ x : L, x ∈ E → σ x = x :=
  ⟨fun hσ x hx => hσ ⟨x, hx⟩, fun h ⟨x, hx⟩ => h x hx⟩
#align intermediate_field.mem_fixing_subgroup_iff IntermediateField.mem_fixingSubgroup_iff

/-- The map `E ↦ Gal(L/E)` is inclusion-reversing -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/KrullTopology/Variant81e5eeb0afc551f495c8801c64b9fc3ae95743aa66fb243a9284829a8af65afa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/KrullTopology/Variant81e5eeb0afc551f495c8801c64b9fc3ae95743aa66fb243a9284829a8af65afa.lean#L134).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `779b146e514c11f38bf56ceb3b8daada005d455e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
