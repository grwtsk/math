## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a603f8ed-59d9-3275-457d-ef0efdfc2f77`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–112.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_galBasis_iff (K L : Type*) [Field K] [Field L] [Algebra K L] (U : Set (L ≃ₐ[K] L)) :
    U ∈ galBasis K L ↔ U ∈ (fun g => g.carrier) '' fixedByFinite K L :=
  Iff.rfl

/-- For a field extension `L/K`, `galGroupBasis K L` is the group filter basis on `L ≃ₐ[K] L`
whose sets are `Gal(L/E)` for finite subextensions `E/K`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/KrullTopology/Variantd9b4361c57a90a1ca4c15239f66cd535fd865bdec59aa27a3514fbc800720469.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/KrullTopology/Variantd9b4361c57a90a1ca4c15239f66cd535fd865bdec59aa27a3514fbc800720469.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3084adef4cbd971d3a3aed40abd228db8109bb54` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
