## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a1cd8b704571f72c0814747946fb87bb570f08152345af39e9ca8afd6644ffad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 147–156.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instField : Field (hat K) where
  exists_pair_ne := ⟨0, 1, fun h => zero_ne_one ((isUniformEmbedding_coe K).injective h)⟩
  mul_inv_cancel := fun x x_ne => by simp only [Inv.inv, if_neg x_ne, mul_hatInv_cancel x_ne]
  inv_zero := by simp only [Inv.inv, ite_true]
  -- TODO: use a better defeq
  nnqsmul := _
  nnqsmul_def := fun _ _ => rfl
  qsmul := _
  qsmul_def := fun _ _ => rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformField/Variant9dc85c9bfd9ce09ddb80bc5475f3e30443632fc4565689f16a0e44d4a9a52c3a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformField/Variant9dc85c9bfd9ce09ddb80bc5475f3e30443632fc4565689f16a0e44d4a9a52c3a.lean#L147).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `29357e36903c9043687627edefc84cc323ef6eea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
