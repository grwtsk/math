## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:31a316ae1ffc12a9a4980652875266520a3b01245fb75fe9022e44888ce96ac1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 185–203.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) completableTopField_of_complete (L : Type*) [Field L] [UniformSpace L]
    [IsTopologicalDivisionRing L] [T0Space L] [CompleteSpace L] : CompletableTopField L where
  nice F cau_F hF := by
    haveI : NeBot F := cau_F.1
    rcases CompleteSpace.complete cau_F with ⟨x, hx⟩
    have hx' : x ≠ 0 := by
      rintro rfl
      rw [inf_eq_right.mpr hx] at hF
      exact cau_F.1.ne hF
    exact Filter.Tendsto.cauchy_map <|
      calc
        map (fun x => x⁻¹) F ≤ map (fun x => x⁻¹) (𝓝 x) := map_mono hx
        _ ≤ 𝓝 x⁻¹ := continuousAt_inv₀ hx'

/-- The pullback of a completable topological field along a uniform inducing
ring homomorphism is a completable topological field. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformField/Variant9dc85c9bfd9ce09ddb80bc5475f3e30443632fc4565689f16a0e44d4a9a52c3a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformField/Variant9dc85c9bfd9ce09ddb80bc5475f3e30443632fc4565689f16a0e44d4a9a52c3a.lean#L185).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `29357e36903c9043687627edefc84cc323ef6eea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
