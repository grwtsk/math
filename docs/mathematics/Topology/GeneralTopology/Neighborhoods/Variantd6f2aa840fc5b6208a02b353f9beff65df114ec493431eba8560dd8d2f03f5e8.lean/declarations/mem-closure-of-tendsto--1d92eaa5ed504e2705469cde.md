## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5cca3063-08b5-229a-c7d9-c3b93204fdd6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 350–355.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_closure_of_tendsto {f : α → X} {b : Filter α} [NeBot b]
    (hf : Tendsto f b (𝓝 x)) (h : ∀ᶠ x in b, f x ∈ s) : x ∈ closure s :=
  mem_closure_of_frequently_of_tendsto h.frequently hf

/-- Suppose that `f` sends the complement to `s` to a single point `x`, and `l` is some filter.
Then `f` tends to `x` along `l` restricted to `s` if and only if it tends to `x` along `l`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Neighborhoods/Variantd6f2aa840fc5b6208a02b353f9beff65df114ec493431eba8560dd8d2f03f5e8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Neighborhoods/Variantd6f2aa840fc5b6208a02b353f9beff65df114ec493431eba8560dd8d2f03f5e8.lean#L350).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1786220817deb3a9d38e9f59e93bd22fafd0dd34` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
