## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:077571c6b09ef49f09f3bf67216d96ca7360b10daa0ea30a2d3a241c412ff076`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 103–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance NormalSpace.instCompletelyRegularSpace [NormalSpace X] [R0Space X] :
    CompletelyRegularSpace X := by
  rw [completelyRegularSpace_iff]
  intro x K hK hx
  have cx : IsClosed (closure {x}) := isClosed_closure
  have d : Disjoint (closure {x}) K := by
    rw [Set.disjoint_iff]
    intro a ⟨hax, haK⟩
    exact hx ((specializes_iff_mem_closure.mpr hax).symm.mem_closed hK haK)
  let ⟨⟨f, cf⟩, hfx, hfK, hficc⟩ := exists_continuous_zero_one_of_isClosed cx hK d
  let g : X → I := fun x => ⟨f x, hficc x⟩
  have cg : Continuous g := cf.subtype_mk hficc
  have hgx : g x = 0 := Subtype.ext (hfx (subset_closure (mem_singleton x)))
  have hgK : EqOn g 1 K := fun k hk => Subtype.ext (hfK hk)
  exact ⟨g, cg, hgx, hgK⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompletelyRegular/Variant8d1732cae1a98bd511baa82b2013406c28879031c8aeea00c8eb1b67db7a6cf0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompletelyRegular/Variant8d1732cae1a98bd511baa82b2013406c28879031c8aeea00c8eb1b67db7a6cf0.lean#L103).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `91f97dddee5dc39432fdf44eb47b44115a99d816` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
