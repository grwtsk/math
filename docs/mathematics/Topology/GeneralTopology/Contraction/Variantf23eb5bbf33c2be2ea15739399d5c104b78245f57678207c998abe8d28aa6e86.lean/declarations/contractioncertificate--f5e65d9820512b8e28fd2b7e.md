## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:83c57d6c67e1463cd47dbeb2243b92cc6fbc421b4a23cdce9ced1d47c6b45a02`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 21–42.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ContractionCertificate
    {X : Type} [Fintype X]
    (kernel : MarkovKernel X)
    (metric : LawMetric X) where
  factor : ℝ
  factorNonnegative : 0 ≤ factor
  factorStrict : factor < 1
  contracts :
    ∀ left right,
      metric.distance (kernel.push left) (kernel.push right) ≤
        factor * metric.distance left right

/-!
`UniformContractionMargin` is the one shared `q` used by every admitted scale.
It does not manufacture a contraction certificate for any scale: a
`ContractionCertificate` must still be supplied and explicitly tied to this
margin by `UsesUniformContractionMargin`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Contraction/Variantf23eb5bbf33c2be2ea15739399d5c104b78245f57678207c998abe8d28aa6e86.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Contraction/Variantf23eb5bbf33c2be2ea15739399d5c104b78245f57678207c998abe8d28aa6e86.lean#L21).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4fb9beb924e43ef641dcf736da38293cb3050d88` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
