## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:38bd83da-fd21-d099-ee06-0a83deed6b10`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 345–356.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma UpperHemicontinuous.isInducing_comp (hf : UpperHemicontinuous f)
    (hi : IsInducing i) (h_cl : IsClosed (range i)) :
    UpperHemicontinuous (fun x ↦ i ⁻¹' (f x)) := by
  rw [upperHemicontinuous_iff] at hf ⊢
  exact fun x ↦ (hf x).isInducing_comp hi h_cl

end Inducing

/-- Upper hemicontinuous functions always have closed domain.

The more general fact is that if `f` is upper hemicontinuous at `x₀` within `s`, and if
`x₀` is a cluster point of `s ∩ {x | (f x).Nonempty}`, then `(f x₀).Nonempty`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hemicontinuity/Varianta08c4104be01bace75f69fdd1d13ecc4505c5f283ce63f392459eee13abde1bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hemicontinuity/Varianta08c4104be01bace75f69fdd1d13ecc4505c5f283ce63f392459eee13abde1bd.lean#L345).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ee84c9d5f5382fab06ddb8d836d53157701446cb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
