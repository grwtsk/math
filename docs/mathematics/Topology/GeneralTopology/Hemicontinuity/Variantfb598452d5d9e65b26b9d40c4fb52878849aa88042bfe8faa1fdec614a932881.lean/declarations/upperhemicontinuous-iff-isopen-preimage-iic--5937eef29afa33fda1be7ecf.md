## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a4daa04d-75e3-776c-92a7-800028e33fb0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–110.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma upperHemicontinuous_iff_isOpen_preimage_Iic :
    UpperHemicontinuous f ↔ ∀ u, IsOpen u → IsOpen (f ⁻¹' Iic u) := by
  simp_rw [upperHemicontinuous_iff_preimage_Iic, isOpen_iff_mem_nhds (s := f ⁻¹' Iic _)]
  conv =>
    enter [1, x]
    rw [hasBasis_nhdsSet (f x) |>.forall_iff fun s t hst ↦ by gcongr]
  simp [forall_comm (α := α)]

/-- A correspondence `f : α → Set β` is upper hemicontinuous if and only if its *lower inverse*
(i.e., `u : Set β ↦ (f ⁻¹' (Iic uᶜ))ᶜ`, note that `f ⁻¹' (Iic u) = {x | (f x ∩ u).Nonempty}`)
sends closed sets to closed sets. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hemicontinuity/Variantfb598452d5d9e65b26b9d40c4fb52878849aa88042bfe8faa1fdec614a932881.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hemicontinuity/Variantfb598452d5d9e65b26b9d40c4fb52878849aa88042bfe8faa1fdec614a932881.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5fe97eff17b1a588d9038f861ba586f978f9626c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
