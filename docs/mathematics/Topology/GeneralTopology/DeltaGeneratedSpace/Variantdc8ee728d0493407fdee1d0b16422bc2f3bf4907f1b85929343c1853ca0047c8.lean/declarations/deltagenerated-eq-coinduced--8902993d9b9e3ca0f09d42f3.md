## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:22228b15-f50d-70df-f715-2acda84d05d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 36–40.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma deltaGenerated_eq_coinduced : deltaGenerated X = coinduced
    (fun x : (f : (n : ℕ) × C(Fin n → ℝ, X)) × (Fin f.1 → ℝ) ↦ x.1.2 x.2) inferInstance := by
  rw [deltaGenerated, instTopologicalSpaceSigma, coinduced_iSup]; rfl

/-- The delta-generated topology is at least as fine as the original one. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/DeltaGeneratedSpace/Variantdc8ee728d0493407fdee1d0b16422bc2f3bf4907f1b85929343c1853ca0047c8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/DeltaGeneratedSpace/Variantdc8ee728d0493407fdee1d0b16422bc2f3bf4907f1b85929343c1853ca0047c8.lean#L36).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `003b90f637fa7e0f8a403a32cc844950620f3042` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
