## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:454890c94b68de73feae869d29ade9c2871e3468a0d5923a9c3ce051360385db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 256–264.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def ExtremallyDisconnected.homeoCompactToT2 [ExtremallyDisconnected A] [T2Space A]
    [T2Space E] [CompactSpace E] {ρ : E → A} (ρ_cont : Continuous ρ) (ρ_surj : ρ.Surjective)
    (zorn_subset : ∀ E₀ : Set E, E₀ ≠ univ → IsClosed E₀ → ρ '' E₀ ≠ univ) : E ≃ₜ A :=
  ρ_cont.homeoOfEquivCompactToT2
    (f := Equiv.ofBijective ρ ⟨homeoCompactToT2_injective ρ_cont ρ_surj zorn_subset, ρ_surj⟩)

/-- Theorem 2.5 in [Gleason, *Projective topological spaces*][gleason1958]:
in the category of compact spaces and continuous maps,
the projective spaces are precisely the extremally disconnected spaces.-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ExtremallyDisconnected/Variant946b4529026bd0160ec87edcef44f344ab93e2b70b01633971dfa491b2aff091.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ExtremallyDisconnected/Variant946b4529026bd0160ec87edcef44f344ab93e2b70b01633971dfa491b2aff091.lean#L256).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9398a10bec500bb329a185e11a9d8a1eee72adee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
