## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7a1d03c0-7313-017f-df44-b2c2a3ddbb60`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 212–216.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma ExtremallyDisconnected.disjoint_closure_of_disjoint_IsOpen [ExtremallyDisconnected A]
    {U₁ U₂ : Set A} (h : Disjoint U₁ U₂) (hU₁ : IsOpen U₁) (hU₂ : IsOpen U₂) :
    Disjoint (closure U₁) (closure U₂) :=
  (h.closure_right hU₁).closure_left <| open_closure U₂ hU₂

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ExtremallyDisconnected/Variantb402030e51f7a055d9df0ed6194a29ccae67aa47e927ef8a32a5ba15080c1e89.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ExtremallyDisconnected/Variantb402030e51f7a055d9df0ed6194a29ccae67aa47e927ef8a32a5ba15080c1e89.lean#L212).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2ef74f11877004731dc8c1a4097909f24c497add` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
