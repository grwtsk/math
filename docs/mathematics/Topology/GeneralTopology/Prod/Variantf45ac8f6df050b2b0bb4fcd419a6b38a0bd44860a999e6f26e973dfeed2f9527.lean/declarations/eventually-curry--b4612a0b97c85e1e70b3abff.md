## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e962d65e-c2d9-c035-c908-f2f4bd09e911`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 189–196.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Eventually.curry {la : Filter α} {lb : Filter β} {p : α × β → Prop}
    (h : ∀ᶠ x in la ×ˢ lb, p x) : ∀ᶠ x in la, ∀ᶠ y in lb, p (x, y) := by
  rcases eventually_prod_iff.1 h with ⟨pa, ha, pb, hb, h⟩
  exact ha.mono fun a ha => hb.mono fun b hb => h ha hb
#align filter.eventually.curry Filter.Eventually.curry

/-- A fact that is eventually true about all pairs `l ×ˢ l` is eventually true about
all diagonal pairs `(i, i)` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Prod/Variantf45ac8f6df050b2b0bb4fcd419a6b38a0bd44860a999e6f26e973dfeed2f9527.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Prod/Variantf45ac8f6df050b2b0bb4fcd419a6b38a0bd44860a999e6f26e973dfeed2f9527.lean#L189).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `53afe17ee8eae880506230d460f7ed9b6c3e7e8e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
