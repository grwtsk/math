## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:42a9c19b-b474-6062-b0fc-9d47928b1ace`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 160–173.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma norm_snd [SeminormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace 𝕜 E]
    [NormedAddCommGroup F] [NormedSpace 𝕜 F] [Nontrivial F] :
    ‖snd 𝕜 E F‖ = 1 := by
  refine le_antisymm (norm_snd_le ..) ?_
  let ⟨f, hf⟩ := exists_ne (0 : F)
  have : ‖f‖ ≤ _ * max ‖(0 : E)‖ ‖f‖ := (snd 𝕜 E F).le_opNorm (0, f)
  rw [norm_zero, max_eq_right (norm_nonneg f)] at this
  rwa [← mul_le_mul_iff_of_pos_right (norm_pos_iff.mpr hf), one_mul]

end FirstSecond

end ContinuousLinearMap

end Normed
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Prod/Variant739ff4d531909760a12c81683f33631880946c3188084641527e1d90f8411026.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Prod/Variant739ff4d531909760a12c81683f33631880946c3188084641527e1d90f8411026.lean#L160).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e9787fccacfb1d2965d37ef10eff3ff863fdcb3e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
