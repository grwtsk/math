## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:20e435f5-9ef5-760e-9152-5521b8f4c6e5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 126–136.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma antidiagonal_congr' (hp : p ∈ antidiagonal n) (hq : q ∈ antidiagonal n) :
    p = q ↔ p.2 = q.2 := by
  rw [← Prod.swap_inj]
  exact antidiagonal_congr (swap_mem_antidiagonal.2 hp) (swap_mem_antidiagonal.2 hq)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Prod/Variantc0b490f5cf49621a76a921a66b8546cf0a9a646583340a4fb8b431ca2f8d3848.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Prod/Variantc0b490f5cf49621a76a921a66b8546cf0a9a646583340a4fb8b431ca2f8d3848.lean#L126).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
