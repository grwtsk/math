## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:623d9f5c53add1eea07f1d91d98d8c87487f83af30f4daebe4591ce0dd505f01`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 184–200.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def sigmaAntidiagonalEquivProd [AddMonoid A] [HasAntidiagonal A] :
    (Σ n : A, antidiagonal n) ≃ A × A where
  toFun x := x.2
  invFun x := ⟨x.1 + x.2, x, mem_antidiagonal.mpr rfl⟩
  left_inv := by
    rintro ⟨n, ⟨k, l⟩, h⟩
    rw [mem_antidiagonal] at h
    exact Sigma.subtype_ext h rfl
  right_inv _ := rfl

variable {A : Type*}
  [AddCommMonoid A] [PartialOrder A] [CanonicallyOrderedAdd A]
  [LocallyFiniteOrderBot A] [DecidableEq A]

/-- In a canonically ordered add monoid, the antidiagonal can be construct by filtering.

Note that this is not an instance, as for some times a more efficient algorithm is available. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Prod/Variantc0b490f5cf49621a76a921a66b8546cf0a9a646583340a4fb8b431ca2f8d3848.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Prod/Variantc0b490f5cf49621a76a921a66b8546cf0a9a646583340a4fb8b431ca2f8d3848.lean#L184).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4415e5e53a8ffa948cc0edd2d4a55593cbf397d7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
