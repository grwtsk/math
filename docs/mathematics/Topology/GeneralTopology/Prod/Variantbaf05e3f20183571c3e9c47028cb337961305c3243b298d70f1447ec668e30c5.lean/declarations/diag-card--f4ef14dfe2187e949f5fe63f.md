## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8ff6b645-d958-c195-53cb-113342984ac9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 321–337.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem diag_card : (diag s).card = s.card := by
  suffices diag s = s.image fun a => (a, a) by
    rw [this]
    apply card_image_of_injOn
    exact fun x1 _ x2 _ h3 => (Prod.mk.inj h3).1
  ext ⟨a₁, a₂⟩
  rw [mem_diag]
  constructor <;> intro h <;> rw [Finset.mem_image] at *
  · use a₁
    simpa using h
  · rcases h with ⟨a, h1, h2⟩
    have h := Prod.mk.inj h2
    rw [← h.1, ← h.2]
    use h1
#align finset.diag_card Finset.diag_card

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Prod/Variantbaf05e3f20183571c3e9c47028cb337961305c3243b298d70f1447ec668e30c5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Prod/Variantbaf05e3f20183571c3e9c47028cb337961305c3243b298d70f1447ec668e30c5.lean#L321).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `389bdc6cf1681ac393a9e992c3095ead5b22b1e2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
