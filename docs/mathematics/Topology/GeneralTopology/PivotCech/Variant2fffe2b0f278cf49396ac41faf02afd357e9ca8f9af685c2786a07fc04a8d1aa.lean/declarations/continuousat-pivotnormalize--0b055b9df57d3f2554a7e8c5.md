## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8b63acab-9829-95f2-aeb9-3e032a34e39b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 51–67.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem continuousAt_pivotNormalize (c : Fin k → Fin n)
    (A : Matrix (Fin k) (Fin n) ℝ) (hc : columnMinor A c ≠ 0) :
    ContinuousAt (fun B => pivotNormalize B c) A := by
  change (columnSubmatrix A c).det ≠ 0 at hc
  have hinv := continuousAt_matrix_inv (columnSubmatrix A c)
    (by simpa only [Ring.inverse_eq_inv'] using continuousAt_inv₀ hc)
  have hframe := hinv.comp
    (f := fun B : Matrix (Fin k) (Fin n) ℝ => columnSubmatrix B c)
    (x := A) (continuous_columnSubmatrix c).continuousAt
  have hmul : Continuous (fun p : Matrix (Fin k) (Fin k) ℝ ×
      Matrix (Fin k) (Fin n) ℝ => p.1 * p.2) :=
    continuous_fst.matrix_mul continuous_snd
  exact hmul.continuousAt.comp
    (f := fun B : Matrix (Fin k) (Fin n) ℝ => ((columnSubmatrix B c)⁻¹, B))
    (x := A) (hframe.prodMk continuous_id.continuousAt)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/PivotCech/Variant2fffe2b0f278cf49396ac41faf02afd357e9ca8f9af685c2786a07fc04a8d1aa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PivotCech/Variant2fffe2b0f278cf49396ac41faf02afd357e9ca8f9af685c2786a07fc04a8d1aa.lean#L51).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `eb59a47773381d8349d660e1fea435dafb6c636f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
