## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0ab63ed0-7871-619a-5b88-8eec8d26d990`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1631–1635.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem beq_eq_beqModel [BEq α] [LawfulBEq α] [Hashable α] [∀ k, BEq (β k)] {m₁ m₂ : Raw₀ α β}  (h₁ : Raw.WFImp m₁.1) (h₂ : Raw.WFImp m₂.1) :
    beq m₁ m₂ = beqModel (toListModel m₁.1.buckets) (toListModel m₂.1.buckets) := by
  simp [beq, beqModel, Raw.size_eq_length h₁, Raw.size_eq_length h₂, Raw.all_eq_all_toListModel,
    get?_eq_getValueCast? h₂]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/WF/Variantc8c4222a48d2cc55665482ac811af032ea153f8693f9b473f765d1b0fb1af68d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/WF/Variantc8c4222a48d2cc55665482ac811af032ea153f8693f9b473f765d1b0fb1af68d.lean#L1631).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5bd9cc397e48742b3b59309288a83feddecbcfa8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
