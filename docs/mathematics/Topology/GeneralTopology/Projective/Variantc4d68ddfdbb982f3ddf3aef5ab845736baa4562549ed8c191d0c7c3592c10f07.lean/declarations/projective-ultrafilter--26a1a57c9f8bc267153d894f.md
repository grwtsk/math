## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:532983684c5d57127eccb49f51f0cc5a64d846158f8615aaf94175158fa18ed6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 40–61.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance projective_ultrafilter (X : Type*) : Projective (of <| Ultrafilter X)
    where
  factors {Y Z} f g hg := by
    rw [epi_iff_surjective] at hg
    obtain ⟨g', hg'⟩ := hg.hasRightInverse
    let t : X → Y := g' ∘ f ∘ (pure : X → Ultrafilter X)
    let h : Ultrafilter X → Y := Ultrafilter.extend t
    have hh : Continuous h := continuous_ultrafilter_extend _
    use ⟨h, hh⟩
    apply Faithful.map_injective (F := forget CompHaus)
    simp only [Functor.map_comp, ContinuousMap.coe_mk, coe_comp]
    convert denseRange_pure.equalizer (g.continuous.comp hh) f.continuous _
    -- Porting note: We need to get the coercions to functions under control.
    -- The next two lines should not be needed.
    let g'' : ContinuousMap Y Z := g
    have : g'' ∘ g' = id := hg'.comp_eq_id
    rw [comp.assoc, ultrafilter_extend_extends, ← comp.assoc, this, comp.left_id]
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false in
#align CompHaus.projective_ultrafilter CompHaus.projective_ultrafilter

/-- For any compact Hausdorff space `X`,
  the natural map `Ultrafilter X → X` is a projective presentation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Projective/Variantc4d68ddfdbb982f3ddf3aef5ab845736baa4562549ed8c191d0c7c3592c10f07.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Projective/Variantc4d68ddfdbb982f3ddf3aef5ab845736baa4562549ed8c191d0c7c3592c10f07.lean#L40).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `84d6b4dea6fda7f49d58501de3c4357c1ec0e0a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
