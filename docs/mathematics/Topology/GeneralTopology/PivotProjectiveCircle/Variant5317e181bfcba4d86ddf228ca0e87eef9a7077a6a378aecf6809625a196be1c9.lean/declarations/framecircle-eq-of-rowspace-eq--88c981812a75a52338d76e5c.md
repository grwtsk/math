## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1d1644b7-f3cc-65ec-f324-7a125bbac5ab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 84–96.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem frameCircle_eq_of_rowSpace_eq (A B : FullRankFrame 1 2)
    (h : frameRowSpace A.val = frameRowSpace B.val) : frameCircle A = frameCircle B := by
  obtain ⟨U, hU, hBA⟩ := exists_rowChange_of_frameRowSpace_eq A.val B.val B.property h
  have hr : U 0 0 ≠ 0 := by simpa only [Matrix.det_eq_elem_of_subsingleton U 0] using hU
  have he (j : Fin 2) : B.val 0 j = U 0 0 * A.val 0 j := by
    have hh := congrFun (congrFun hBA 0) j
    simpa only [Matrix.mul_apply, Fin.sum_univ_one] using hh
  apply Subtype.ext
  change doubleAngle (A.val 0 0) (A.val 0 1) = doubleAngle (B.val 0 0) (B.val 0 1)
  rw [he 0, he 1]

/-- Logical frame choice is used only after representative independence is proved. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/PivotProjectiveCircle/Variant5317e181bfcba4d86ddf228ca0e87eef9a7077a6a378aecf6809625a196be1c9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PivotProjectiveCircle/Variant5317e181bfcba4d86ddf228ca0e87eef9a7077a6a378aecf6809625a196be1c9.lean#L84).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `925a634a4d405002a30235e5cc11b34fc191f5b5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
