## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5ca66efde414aeef78d31a7d3ab9b2ecb54d11a8cda627f7c059da9d74be5687`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 436–456.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [SemilatticeSup Y] [Zero Y] : Max (locallyFinsuppWithin U Y) where
  max D₁ D₂ :=
  { toFun z := max (D₁ z) (D₂ z)
    supportWithinDomain' := by
      intro x
      contrapose
      intro hx
      simp [notMem_support.1 fun a ↦ hx (D₁.supportWithinDomain a),
        notMem_support.1 fun a ↦ hx (D₂.supportWithinDomain a)]
    supportLocallyFiniteWithinDomain' := by
      intro z hz
      obtain ⟨t₁, ht₁⟩ := D₁.supportLocallyFiniteWithinDomain z hz
      obtain ⟨t₂, ht₂⟩ := D₂.supportLocallyFiniteWithinDomain z hz
      use t₁ ∩ t₂, inter_mem ht₁.1 ht₂.1
      apply Set.Finite.subset (s := (t₁ ∩ D₁.support) ∪ (t₂ ∩ D₂.support)) (ht₁.2.union ht₂.2)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyFinsupp/Variante6d7fabcfcd66e1313ca8258208e2a5e916b0c2ee69bdcca8aca08e17f0312b2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyFinsupp/Variante6d7fabcfcd66e1313ca8258208e2a5e916b0c2ee69bdcca8aca08e17f0312b2.lean#L436).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `80084dd2ce2e6875491a2bd80de9e453c951612b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
