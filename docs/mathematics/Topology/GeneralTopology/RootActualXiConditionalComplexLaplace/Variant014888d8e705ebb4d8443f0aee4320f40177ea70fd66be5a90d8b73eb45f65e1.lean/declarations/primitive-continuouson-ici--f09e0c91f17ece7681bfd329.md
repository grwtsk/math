## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:11a6a602-63e9-f864-1171-c215d674b8af`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 19–31.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem primitive_continuousOn_Ici :
    ContinuousOn actualAnchoredXiTailPrimitive (Ici (Real.log 7)) := by
  intro t ht
  change Real.log 7 ≤ t at ht
  have hb : Real.log 7 ≤ t + 1 := by linarith
  have hc := (actualAnchoredXiTailPrimitive_absolutelyContinuous hb).continuousOn
  rw [uIcc_of_le hb] at hc
  apply (hc t ⟨ht, by linarith⟩).mono_of_mem_nhdsWithin
  rw [← Ici_inter_Iic]
  exact inter_mem self_mem_nhdsWithin
    (nhdsWithin_le_nhds (Iic_mem_nhds (by linarith : t < t + 1)))

/-- The literal complex kernel norm is exactly the real weighted source norm. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/RootActualXiConditionalComplexLaplace/Variant014888d8e705ebb4d8443f0aee4320f40177ea70fd66be5a90d8b73eb45f65e1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/RootActualXiConditionalComplexLaplace/Variant014888d8e705ebb4d8443f0aee4320f40177ea70fd66be5a90d8b73eb45f65e1.lean#L19).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `26a49c908e197cb02ca568c62bc007fc095ab9b6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
