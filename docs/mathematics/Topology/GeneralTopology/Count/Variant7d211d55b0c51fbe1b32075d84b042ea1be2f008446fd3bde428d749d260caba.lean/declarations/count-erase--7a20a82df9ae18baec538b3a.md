## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:24fb0e7c-57f9-085a-0ec2-5f225dcb3b87`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 233–247.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem count_erase (a b : α) :
    ∀ l : List α, count a (l.erase b) = count a l - if a = b then 1 else 0
  | [] => by simp
  | c :: l => by
    rw [erase_cons]
    if hc : c = b then
      rw [if_pos hc, hc, count_cons, Nat.add_sub_cancel]
    else
      rw [if_neg hc, count_cons, count_cons, count_erase a b l]
      if ha : a = b then
        rw [← ha, eq_comm] at hc
        rw [if_pos ha, if_neg hc, Nat.add_zero, Nat.add_zero]
      else
        rw [if_neg ha, Nat.sub_zero, Nat.sub_zero]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Count/Variant7d211d55b0c51fbe1b32075d84b042ea1be2f008446fd3bde428d749d260caba.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Count/Variant7d211d55b0c51fbe1b32075d84b042ea1be2f008446fd3bde428d749d260caba.lean#L233).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ec84f01a1b1adcf70484e95d8e925a34266c5dff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
