## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1a00ce68777360fa94598ed298492cc3bb9afbca316edf59b8704eb2a85a3082`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 113–132.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure PowerTowerBoundaryCertificate where
  dynamics : PowerTowerDynamics
  contractive :
    ContractiveBoundaryCertificate ℂ Unit
  basinMatches :
    contractive.basin = dynamics.basin
  stepMatches :
    contractive.step () = dynamics.step
  boundaryMatches :
    contractive.boundary = dynamics.boundary
  derivativeToLipschitz :
    PowerTowerDerivativeToLipschitzBridge
      dynamics contractive.contraction

/--
Implemented power-tower steps carry two separate residual coordinates.
`stateDefect` enters the boundary-distance recurrence.  The logarithmic
verification residual remains independently visible and acquires no metric
authority without an additional bridge.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/PowerTowerBoundary/Variant89803b2f951a99086eaf6d594dd4a31cea8f1ad1bd096960492d812f2badafac.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PowerTowerBoundary/Variant89803b2f951a99086eaf6d594dd4a31cea8f1ad1bd096960492d812f2badafac.lean#L113).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a79c685f4bdce23a69572173aad8428e2187022` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
