## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8f6a9e67-c5f2-30a1-0cc8-305ed5f9a179`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 237–254.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Continuous.comp_div_cases {f g : α → G₀} (h : α → G₀ → β) (hf : Continuous f)
    (hg : Continuous g) (hh : ∀ a, g a ≠ 0 → ContinuousAt (↿h) (a, f a / g a))
    (h2h : ∀ a, g a = 0 → Tendsto (↿h) (𝓝 a ×ˢ ⊤) (𝓝 (h a 0))) :
    Continuous fun x => h x (f x / g x) :=
  continuous_iff_continuousAt.mpr fun a =>
    hf.continuousAt.comp_div_cases _ hg.continuousAt (hh a) (h2h a)

/-- Left multiplication by a nonzero element in a `GroupWithZero` with continuous multiplication
is a homeomorphism of the underlying type. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/GroupWithZero/Variantd67949658e1f61e9ed24f615eabedf282f1c6c7680ec4832ce3d1375a5db8270.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/GroupWithZero/Variantd67949658e1f61e9ed24f615eabedf282f1c6c7680ec4832ce3d1375a5db8270.lean#L237).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6e88a392290dd1450ae457dbe31a9f7810718149` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
