## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1a8fab92-7041-e476-56af-b4ca66d25b54`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–151.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContinuousOn.inv₀ (hf : ContinuousOn f s) (h0 : ∀ x ∈ s, f x ≠ 0) :
    ContinuousOn (fun x => (f x)⁻¹) s := fun x hx => (hf x hx).inv₀ (h0 x hx)
#align continuous_on.inv₀ ContinuousOn.inv₀

end Inv₀

/-- If `G₀` is a group with zero with topology such that `x ↦ x⁻¹` is continuous at all nonzero
points. Then the coercion `G₀ˣ → G₀` is a topological embedding. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/GroupWithZero/Variant84637e8252d884a908099704c9448098702c822e61fc2ae180edc5d0ff017076.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/GroupWithZero/Variant84637e8252d884a908099704c9448098702c822e61fc2ae180edc5d0ff017076.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3c077fbea6cded50ee848a09830538d5566134fb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
