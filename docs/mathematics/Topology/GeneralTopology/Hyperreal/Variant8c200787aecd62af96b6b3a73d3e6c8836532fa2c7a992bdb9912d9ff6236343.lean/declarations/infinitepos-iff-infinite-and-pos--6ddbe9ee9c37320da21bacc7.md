## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7fc89bf7-dcbe-3fb6-57c9-ec099402052b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 419–422.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem infinitePos_iff_infinite_and_pos {x : ℝ*} : InfinitePos x ↔ Infinite x ∧ 0 < x :=
  ⟨fun hip => ⟨Or.inl hip, hip 0⟩, fun ⟨hi, hp⟩ =>
    hi.casesOn id fun hin => False.elim (not_lt_of_lt hp (hin 0))⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hyperreal/Variant8c200787aecd62af96b6b3a73d3e6c8836532fa2c7a992bdb9912d9ff6236343.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hyperreal/Variant8c200787aecd62af96b6b3a73d3e6c8836532fa2c7a992bdb9912d9ff6236343.lean#L419).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e0f5557a0b450887d01f69df6f3072fb5227760d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
