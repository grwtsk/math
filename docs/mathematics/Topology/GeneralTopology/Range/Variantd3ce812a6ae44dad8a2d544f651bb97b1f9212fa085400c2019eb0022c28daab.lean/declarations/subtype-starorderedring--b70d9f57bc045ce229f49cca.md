## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:860e5c2d30ce1fbe71a8e668a5b93c19fe4648aacc607bf1cc6e4472178e4704`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 303–316.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Subtype.starOrderedRing (s : S) [hs : IsClosed (s : Set A)] : StarOrderedRing s :=
  .of_nonneg_iff' add_le_add_right fun x ↦ by
    refine ⟨?_, ?_⟩
    · intro (hx : 0 ≤ (x : A))
      use ⟨cfcₙ Real.sqrt (x : A), cfcₙ_mem _ x.2⟩
      ext
      simp only [MulMemClass.coe_mul, StarMemClass.coe_star]
      rw [IsSelfAdjoint.star_eq (by cfc_tac), ← cfcₙ_mul ..]
      convert (cfcₙ_id' ℝ (x : A)).symm using 1
      exact cfcₙ_congr fun r hr ↦ by grind [Real.mul_self_sqrt]
    · rintro ⟨s, hs⟩
      simp [← Subtype.coe_le_coe, hs]

end StarOrderedSubtype
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Range/Variantd3ce812a6ae44dad8a2d544f651bb97b1f9212fa085400c2019eb0022c28daab.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Range/Variantd3ce812a6ae44dad8a2d544f651bb97b1f9212fa085400c2019eb0022c28daab.lean#L303).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `436c8ca481110b3a1d8f2a50e84542d25390af67` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
