## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1243f622-4ba9-4dd3-63ef-1363006cc587`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 197–202.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Tendsto.atTop_mul_const_of_neg' (hr : r < 0) (hf : Tendsto f l atTop) :
    Tendsto (fun x => f x * r) l atBot := by
  simpa only [tendsto_neg_atTop_iff, mul_neg] using hf.atTop_mul_const' (neg_pos.mpr hr)

/-- See also `Filter.Tendsto.atBot_mul_const` for a version of this lemma for
`LinearOrderedField`s which does not require the `Archimedean` assumption. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Archimedean/Variant07e9596ae02b86261ac825d8162623f78f5d1bcbcc22b5874e6807beddfa3455.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Archimedean/Variant07e9596ae02b86261ac825d8162623f78f5d1bcbcc22b5874e6807beddfa3455.lean#L197).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1d1f6ffed91ae0a51f0d70fde5c791349f1e507c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
