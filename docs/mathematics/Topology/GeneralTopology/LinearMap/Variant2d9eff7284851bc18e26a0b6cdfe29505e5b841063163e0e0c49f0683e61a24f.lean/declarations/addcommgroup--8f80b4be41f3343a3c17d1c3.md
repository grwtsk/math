## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e41e1874e48cff567f6c7e0e84fe5a480080904e486e5e43a6f97bc7b8f30c00`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 786–797.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance addCommGroup : AddCommGroup (M →SL[σ₁₂] M₂) where
  __ := ContinuousLinearMap.addCommMonoid
  neg := (-·)
  sub := (· - ·)
  sub_eq_add_neg _ _ := by ext; apply sub_eq_add_neg
  nsmul := (· • ·)
  zsmul := (· • ·)
  zsmul_zero' f := by ext; simp
  zsmul_succ' n f := by ext; simp [add_smul, add_comm]
  zsmul_neg' n f := by ext; simp [add_smul]
  neg_add_cancel _ := by ext; apply neg_add_cancel

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LinearMap/Variant2d9eff7284851bc18e26a0b6cdfe29505e5b841063163e0e0c49f0683e61a24f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LinearMap/Variant2d9eff7284851bc18e26a0b6cdfe29505e5b841063163e0e0c49f0683e61a24f.lean#L786).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2e71c00c890995178465124f2912166de722d50a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
