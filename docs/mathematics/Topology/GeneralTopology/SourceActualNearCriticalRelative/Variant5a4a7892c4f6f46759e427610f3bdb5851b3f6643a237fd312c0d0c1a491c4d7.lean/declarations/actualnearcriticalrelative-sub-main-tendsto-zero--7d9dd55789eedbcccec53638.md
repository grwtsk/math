## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:27e89720-9c6c-f4c4-071c-8ddc41644d93`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 298–310.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem actualNearCriticalRelative_sub_main_tendsto_zero :
    Tendsto (fun A : ℝ => actualNearCriticalRelativePairing A -
      actualNearCriticalRelativeMain A) atTop (𝓝 0) := by
  have ht : Tendsto (fun A : ℝ => (Real.log A) ^ 2 / A) atTop (𝓝 0) := by
    simpa using Real.tendsto_pow_log_div_mul_add_atTop 1 0 2 one_ne_zero
  have hh := ht.const_mul (10 * (Real.log 4 + 3))
  simp only [mul_zero] at hh
  apply squeeze_zero_norm' ?_ hh
  filter_upwards [eventually_ge_atTop (91 : ℝ)] with A hA
  simpa only [Real.norm_eq_abs, mul_div_assoc] using
    actualNearCriticalRelative_sub_main_abs_le hA

/-- The paid near sector is sublinear, while no constant upper bound is inferred. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualNearCriticalRelative/Variant5a4a7892c4f6f46759e427610f3bdb5851b3f6643a237fd312c0d0c1a491c4d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualNearCriticalRelative/Variant5a4a7892c4f6f46759e427610f3bdb5851b3f6643a237fd312c0d0c1a491c4d7.lean#L298).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ec7bb909701363f5686446572dc3f84221b7b873` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
