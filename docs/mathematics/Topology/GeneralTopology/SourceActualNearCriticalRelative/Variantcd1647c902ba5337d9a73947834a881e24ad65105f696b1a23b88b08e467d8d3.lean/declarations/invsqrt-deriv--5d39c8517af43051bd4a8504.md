## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:228116d0-8887-4773-e28a-10f95dfe6ce2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 130–138.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem invsqrt_deriv {x : ℝ} (hx : 0 < x) :
    HasDerivAt (fun x : ℝ => 1 / Real.sqrt x) (-1 / (2 * x * Real.sqrt x)) x := by
  have hs : Real.sqrt x ≠ 0 := (Real.sqrt_pos.2 hx).ne'
  simp only [one_div]
  apply ((Real.hasDerivAt_sqrt hx.ne').inv hs).congr_deriv
  have hss := Real.sq_sqrt hx.le
  field_simp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualNearCriticalRelative/Variantcd1647c902ba5337d9a73947834a881e24ad65105f696b1a23b88b08e467d8d3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualNearCriticalRelative/Variantcd1647c902ba5337d9a73947834a881e24ad65105f696b1a23b88b08e467d8d3.lean#L130).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ed4514f4578ea2b7ef72a534ae15838a2439cc0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
