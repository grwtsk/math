## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:544bd1d5-f0dd-c0a8-2b49-02de49769743`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 186–194.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasBasis_nhds_zero :
    (𝓝 (0 : R)).HasBasis (fun _ ↦ True)
      fun γ : (ValueGroup₀ (.ofClass v))ˣ ↦ { x | v.restrict x < γ.val } := by
  simp [Filter.hasBasis_iff, v.is_topological_valuation]

/-- The set `{ y : R | v y = v x }` is a neighbourhood of `x`.
This does not imply that `v` is locally constant everywhere (since `v ⁻¹' {0}` is not open),
but it is equivalent to the restriction of `v` to the complement of its support being
locally constant. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ValuativeTopology/Variant9681d2ee9b930155a24b9955995c2167fe56fa316f9e6b9d42379688fe4d2f43.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ValuativeTopology/Variant9681d2ee9b930155a24b9955995c2167fe56fa316f9e6b9d42379688fe4d2f43.lean#L186).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e4cf09f93bf16d223bd5e106fb4758e780a28df5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
