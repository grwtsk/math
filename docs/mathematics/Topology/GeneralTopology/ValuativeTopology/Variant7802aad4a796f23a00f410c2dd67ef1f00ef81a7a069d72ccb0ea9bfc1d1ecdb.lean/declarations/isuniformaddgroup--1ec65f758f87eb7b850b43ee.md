## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e5e17caffa64a7ab58871083096d7a62a17468d597d3a9e92a1381298c8a1fb6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 95–110.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
local instance isUniformAddGroup : IsUniformAddGroup R := isUniformAddGroup_of_addCommGroup

end ValuativeRel

variable {R}

variable {K : Type*} [DivisionRing K] [ValuativeRel K] {Γ₀ : Type*}
  [LinearOrderedCommGroupWithZero Γ₀]

section TopologicalSpace

variable [TopologicalSpace R] (v : Valuation R Γ₀) [v.Compatible]
namespace IsValuativeTopology

/-- If the neighborhoods of every point for a given topology are defined by a valuation `v`
compatible with the valuative relation, then the topology is a valuative topology. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ValuativeTopology/Variant7802aad4a796f23a00f410c2dd67ef1f00ef81a7a069d72ccb0ea9bfc1d1ecdb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ValuativeTopology/Variant7802aad4a796f23a00f410c2dd67ef1f00ef81a7a069d72ccb0ea9bfc1d1ecdb.lean#L95).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7ba47d631fda672aa66fff4c8f28932743a08507` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
