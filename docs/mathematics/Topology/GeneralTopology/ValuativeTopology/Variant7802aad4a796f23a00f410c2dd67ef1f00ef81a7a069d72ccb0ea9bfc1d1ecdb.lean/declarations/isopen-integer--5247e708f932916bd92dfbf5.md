## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1700fd71-f454-ce30-f813-ac143bd2f0f9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 387–393.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isOpen_integer : IsOpen (v.integer : Set R) := by
  simp only [integer, Subring.coe_set_mk, Subsemiring.coe_set_mk, Submonoid.coe_set_mk,
    Subsemigroup.coe_set_mk, ← v.restrict_le_one_iff]
  apply isOpen_closedBall one_ne_zero

/-- For any valuation `v` compatible with the valuative relation on `R`, the closed unit ball
around zero `{x | v x ≤ 1}` is closed in the valuative topology. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ValuativeTopology/Variant7802aad4a796f23a00f410c2dd67ef1f00ef81a7a069d72ccb0ea9bfc1d1ecdb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ValuativeTopology/Variant7802aad4a796f23a00f410c2dd67ef1f00ef81a7a069d72ccb0ea9bfc1d1ecdb.lean#L387).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7ba47d631fda672aa66fff4c8f28932743a08507` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
