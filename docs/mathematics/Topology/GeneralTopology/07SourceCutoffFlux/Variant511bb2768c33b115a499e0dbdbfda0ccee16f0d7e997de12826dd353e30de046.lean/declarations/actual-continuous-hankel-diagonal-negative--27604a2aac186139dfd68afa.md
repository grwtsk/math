## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:df0c027b-ab56-0e9c-512b-78ac0599ba8b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 701–718.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    ∃ x : ℝ, 1 < x ∧ sourcePlainWeight A (x * x) < 0 := by
  obtain ⟨s, hs, _, hc⟩ := actual_sourceCorrelation_negative_inside hA
  let x := Real.exp (s / 2)
  have hx : 1 < x := Real.one_lt_exp_iff.mpr (by linarith)
  have he : x * x = Real.exp s := by

/-- A positive Gram realization of the actual continuous Hankel kernel is impossible.
This obstruction leaves indefinite signed realizations and integer-cell questions open. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/07SourceCutoffFlux/Variant511bb2768c33b115a499e0dbdbfda0ccee16f0d7e997de12826dd353e30de046.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/07SourceCutoffFlux/Variant511bb2768c33b115a499e0dbdbfda0ccee16f0d7e997de12826dd353e30de046.lean#L701).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8fd7bb04b663cbc0473dc12e1fb7876244d30960` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
