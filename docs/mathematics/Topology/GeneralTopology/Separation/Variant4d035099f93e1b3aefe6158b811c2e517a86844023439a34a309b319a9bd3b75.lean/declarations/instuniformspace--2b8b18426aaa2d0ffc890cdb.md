## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:105d426f06416f6297eab3692046394295025d6017e4b12fc1d9f010f53e1e93`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 209–222.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instUniformSpace : UniformSpace (SeparationQuotient α) where
  uniformity := map (Prod.map mk mk) (𝓤 α)
  symm := tendsto_map' <| tendsto_map.comp tendsto_swap_uniformity
  comp := fun t ht ↦ by
    rcases comp_open_symm_mem_uniformity_sets ht with ⟨U, hU, hUo, -, hUt⟩
    refine mem_of_superset (mem_lift' <| image_mem_map hU) ?_
    simp only [subset_def, Prod.forall, mem_compRel, mem_image, Prod.ext_iff]
    rintro _ _ ⟨_, ⟨⟨x, y⟩, hxyU, rfl, rfl⟩, ⟨⟨y', z⟩, hyzU, hy, rfl⟩⟩
    have : y' ⤳ y := (mk_eq_mk.1 hy).specializes
    exact @hUt (x, z) ⟨y', this.mem_open (UniformSpace.isOpen_ball _ hUo) hxyU, hyzU⟩
  nhds_eq_comap_uniformity := surjective_mk.forall.2 fun x ↦ comap_injective surjective_mk <| by
    conv_lhs => rw [comap_mk_nhds_mk, nhds_eq_comap_uniformity, ← comap_map_mk_uniformity]
    simp only [Filter.comap_comap, Function.comp_def, Prod.map_apply]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Separation/Variant4d035099f93e1b3aefe6158b811c2e517a86844023439a34a309b319a9bd3b75.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Separation/Variant4d035099f93e1b3aefe6158b811c2e517a86844023439a34a309b319a9bd3b75.lean#L209).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1df82c42119be01e922d187d81992ba3065ec3ae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
