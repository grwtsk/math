## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ca3495d5f72da6186eca0e3cd3b9a74ae69203463663f66a148abff2460fb1a9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1674–1683.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {ι : Type*} {π : ι → Type*} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (π i)] [∀ i, RegularSpace (π i)] :
    RegularSpace (∀ i, π i) :=
  regularSpace_iInf fun _ => regularSpace_induced _

end RegularSpace

section T3

/-- A T₃ space is a T₀ space which is a regular space. Any T₃ space is a T₁ space, a T₂ space, and
a T₂.₅ space.  -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Separation/Variantb38526da9fedbf4a6aa19bbc6d77e4d729490eb1148ed9f5844960bfa870656c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Separation/Variantb38526da9fedbf4a6aa19bbc6d77e4d729490eb1148ed9f5844960bfa870656c.lean#L1674).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e96b4e724267e55a28c0d080afa3d662cb6bd3ce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
