## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:78dda1b3ed595541fb11ec34e17505f087202ce7074d860a3e2102036a8c4f84`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2093–2116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance ConnectedComponents.t2 [T2Space α] [CompactSpace α] : T2Space (ConnectedComponents α) := by
  -- Proof follows that of: https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0900
  -- Fix 2 distinct connected components, with points a and b
  refine ⟨ConnectedComponents.surjective_coe.forall₂.2 fun a b ne => ?_⟩
  rw [ConnectedComponents.coe_ne_coe] at ne
  have h := connectedComponent_disjoint ne
  -- write ↑b as the intersection of all clopen subsets containing it
  rw [connectedComponent_eq_iInter_clopen b, disjoint_iff_inter_eq_empty] at h
  -- Now we show that this can be reduced to some clopen containing `↑b` being disjoint to `↑a`
  obtain ⟨U, V, hU, ha, hb, rfl⟩ : ∃ (U : Set α) (V : Set (ConnectedComponents α)),
      IsClopen U ∧ connectedComponent a ∩ U = ∅ ∧ connectedComponent b ⊆ U ∧ (↑) ⁻¹' V = U := by
    have h :=
      (isClosed_connectedComponent (α := α)).isCompact.elim_finite_subfamily_closed
        _ (fun Z : { Z : Set α // IsClopen Z ∧ b ∈ Z } => Z.2.1.2) h
    cases' h with fin_a ha
    -- This clopen and its complement will separate the connected components of `a` and `b`
    set U : Set α := ⋂ (i : { Z // IsClopen Z ∧ b ∈ Z }) (_ : i ∈ fin_a), i
    have hU : IsClopen U := isClopen_biInter_finset fun i _ => i.2.1
    exact ⟨U, (↑) '' U, hU, ha, subset_iInter₂ fun Z _ => Z.2.1.connectedComponent_subset Z.2.2,
      (connectedComponents_preimage_image U).symm ▸ hU.biUnion_connectedComponent_eq⟩
  rw [ConnectedComponents.quotientMap_coe.isClopen_preimage] at hU
  refine' ⟨Vᶜ, V, hU.compl.isOpen, hU.isOpen, _, hb mem_connectedComponent, disjoint_compl_left⟩
  exact fun h => flip Set.Nonempty.ne_empty ha ⟨a, mem_connectedComponent, h⟩
#align connected_components.t2 ConnectedComponents.t2
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Separation/Variant949605514a678cc4012f1b3f4f20c672cebda66a1ed322cb4bc64591fde0955c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Separation/Variant949605514a678cc4012f1b3f4f20c672cebda66a1ed322cb4bc64591fde0955c.lean#L2093).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `48e4761a1d4f1e3a46cd7c2bd83b5a0a7b227c9f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
