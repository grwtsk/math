## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e929a66a-ca7d-678d-28e2-d027422c0b6a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2002–2025.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nhds_basis_clopen (x : α) : (𝓝 x).HasBasis (fun s : Set α => x ∈ s ∧ IsClopen s) id :=
  ⟨fun U => by
    constructor
    · have hx : connectedComponent x = {x} :=
        totallyDisconnectedSpace_iff_connectedComponent_singleton.mp ‹_› x
      rw [connectedComponent_eq_iInter_clopen] at hx
      intro hU
      let N := { Z // IsClopen Z ∧ x ∈ Z }
      suffices : ∃ Z : N, Z.val ⊆ U
      · rcases this with ⟨⟨s, hs, hs'⟩, hs''⟩; exact ⟨s, ⟨hs', hs⟩, hs''⟩
      haveI : Nonempty N := ⟨⟨univ, isClopen_univ, mem_univ x⟩⟩
      have hNcl : ∀ Z : N, IsClosed Z.val := fun Z => Z.property.1.2
      have hdir : Directed Superset fun Z : N => Z.val := by
        rintro ⟨s, hs, hxs⟩ ⟨t, ht, hxt⟩
        exact ⟨⟨s ∩ t, hs.inter ht, ⟨hxs, hxt⟩⟩, inter_subset_left s t, inter_subset_right s t⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Separation/Variant949605514a678cc4012f1b3f4f20c672cebda66a1ed322cb4bc64591fde0955c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Separation/Variant949605514a678cc4012f1b3f4f20c672cebda66a1ed322cb4bc64591fde0955c.lean#L2002).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `48e4761a1d4f1e3a46cd7c2bd83b5a0a7b227c9f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
