## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0aefe414-c78d-b3a7-b788-0f071e404fe3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 752–759.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_of_tendsto_nhds [TopologicalSpace β] [T1Space β] {f : α → β} {a : α} {b : β}
    (h : Tendsto f (𝓝 a) (𝓝 b)) : f a = b :=
  by_contra fun hfa : f a ≠ b =>
    have fact₁ : {f a}ᶜ ∈ 𝓝 b := compl_singleton_mem_nhds hfa.symm
    have fact₂ : Tendsto f (pure a) (𝓝 b) := h.comp (tendsto_id'.2 <| pure_le_nhds a)
    fact₂ fact₁ (Eq.refl <| f a)
#align eq_of_tendsto_nhds eq_of_tendsto_nhds

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Separation/Variant949605514a678cc4012f1b3f4f20c672cebda66a1ed322cb4bc64591fde0955c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Separation/Variant949605514a678cc4012f1b3f4f20c672cebda66a1ed322cb4bc64591fde0955c.lean#L752).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `48e4761a1d4f1e3a46cd7c2bd83b5a0a7b227c9f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
