# Continuous monoid action

In this file we define class `ContinuousSMul`. We say `ContinuousSMul M X` if `M` acts on `X` and
the map `(c, x) ↦ c • x` is continuous on `M × X`. We reuse this class for topological
(semi)modules, vector spaces and algebras.

## Main definitions

* `ContinuousSMul M X` : typeclass saying that the map `(c, x) ↦ c • x` is continuous
  on `M × X`;
* `Units.continuousSMul`: scalar multiplication by `Mˣ` is continuous when scalar
  multiplication by `M` is continuous. This allows `Homeomorph.smul` to be used with on monoids
  with `G = Mˣ`.

-- Porting note: These have all moved
* `Homeomorph.smul_of_ne_zero`: if a group with zero `G₀` (e.g., a field) acts on `X` and `c : G₀`
  is a nonzero element of `G₀`, then scalar multiplication by `c` is a homeomorphism of `X`;
* `Homeomorph.smul`: scalar multiplication by an element of a group `G` acting on `X`
  is a homeomorphism of `X`.

## Main results

Besides homeomorphisms mentioned above, in this file we provide lemmas like `Continuous.smul`
or `Filter.Tendsto.smul` that provide dot-syntax access to `ContinuousSMul`.
