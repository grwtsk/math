## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e6716bd7-3766-3d0a-be09-ebca3e4bde2d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 221–229.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma PreconnectedSpace.induction₂ [PreconnectedSpace α] (P : α → α → Prop) [Std.Symm P]
    (h : ∀ x, ∀ᶠ y in 𝓝 x, P x y) (h' : IsTrans α P) (x y : α) : P x y := by
  refine PreconnectedSpace.induction₂' P (fun z ↦ ?_) h' x y
  filter_upwards [h z] with a ha
  exact ⟨ha, symm ha⟩

/-- In a preconnected set, given a transitive relation `P`, if `P x y` and `P y x` are true
for `y` close enough to `x`, then `P x y` holds for all `x, y`. This is a version of the fact
that, if an equivalence relation has open classes, then it has a single equivalence class. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Clopen/Varianteb475d463d47795bd0011975395ecd01d734809db15fc5b35662e7bc36012db0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Clopen/Varianteb475d463d47795bd0011975395ecd01d734809db15fc5b35662e7bc36012db0.lean#L221).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0acb126ddce701c465d18d0c453d10d1b335b311` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
