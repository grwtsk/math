## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4ff56f3e-0891-1664-4963-16a414d34c68`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 205–223.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem balancedFirstPrimeHead_abs_le {A : ℝ} (hA : 91 ≤ A) :
    |balancedFirstPrimeHead A| ≤ 20 * Real.log A / A := by
  obtain ⟨hL, hH⟩ := floor_head_orders hA
  have hh := balancedFirstPrime_head_abs_le hA hL
  have hp : 0 < A := by linarith
  have hla : 0 ≤ Real.log A := Real.log_nonneg (by linarith)
  have hex : Real.exp (Real.log (⌊A ^ 2⌋₊ : ℝ) / 2) ≤ A := by
    simpa only [Real.exp_log hp] using Real.exp_le_exp.mpr
      (show Real.log (⌊A ^ 2⌋₊ : ℝ) / 2 ≤ Real.log A by linarith)
  have hprod := mul_le_mul hH hex (Real.exp_pos _).le
    (by positivity : 0 ≤ 2 * Real.log A)
  have he := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left hprod
    (by positivity : 0 ≤ (10 : ℝ) / A ^ 2)
  change |balancedFirstPrimeHead A| ≤ _ at hh
  exact hh.trans (by
    convert he using 1

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceBalancedFirstPrimePrimitive/Variant55e0e17b6ce07a74d472a30b3bde6efcfe9fb201a1f76cbabd8c835fc062d159.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceBalancedFirstPrimePrimitive/Variant55e0e17b6ce07a74d472a30b3bde6efcfe9fb201a1f76cbabd8c835fc062d159.lean#L205).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `720281a45b1ec20abac1242a8ce2ba4c5d6dcf30` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
