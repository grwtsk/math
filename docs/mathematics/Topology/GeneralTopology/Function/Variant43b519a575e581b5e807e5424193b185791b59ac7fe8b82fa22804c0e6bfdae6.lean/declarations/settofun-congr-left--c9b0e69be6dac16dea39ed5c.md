## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:498d4114-3110-c372-29c4-cab9995237ce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 77–85.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem setToFun_congr_left (hT : DominatedFinMeasAdditive μ T C)
    (hT' : DominatedFinMeasAdditive μ T' C') (h : T = T') (f : α → E) :
    setToFun μ T hT f = setToFun μ T' hT' f := by
  by_cases hF : CompleteSpace F; swap
  · simp [setToFun, hF]
  by_cases hf : Integrable f μ
  · simp_rw [setToFun_eq _ hf, L1.setToL1_congr_left T T' hT hT' h]
  · simp_rw [setToFun_undef _ hf]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Function/Variant43b519a575e581b5e807e5424193b185791b59ac7fe8b82fa22804c0e6bfdae6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Function/Variant43b519a575e581b5e807e5424193b185791b59ac7fe8b82fa22804c0e6bfdae6.lean#L77).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c5f0e17f995d604b6a8a1ce27317904b0412fcb2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
