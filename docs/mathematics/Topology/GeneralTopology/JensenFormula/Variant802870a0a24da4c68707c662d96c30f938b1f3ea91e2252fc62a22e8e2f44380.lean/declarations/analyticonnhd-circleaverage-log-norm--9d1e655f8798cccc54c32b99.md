## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a85f91de-0582-2bbb-8341-7cea8d0ad10f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 383–396.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem AnalyticOnNhd.circleAverage_log_norm {c : ℂ} {R : ℝ} {f : ℂ → ℂ} (hR : R ≠ 0)
    (h₁f : AnalyticOnNhd ℂ f (closedBall c |R|))
    (h₂f : f c ≠ 0) :
    circleAverage (Real.log ‖f ·‖) c R
      = ∑ᶠ u, divisor f (closedBall c |R|) u * Real.log (R * ‖c - u‖⁻¹) + Real.log ‖f c‖ := by

**Jensen's Inequality**: Estimates the number of zeros of `f` in a ball of radius `r`
given that `f` is analytic and bounded by `M` on a larger ball of radius `R`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/JensenFormula/Variant802870a0a24da4c68707c662d96c30f938b1f3ea91e2252fc62a22e8e2f44380.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/JensenFormula/Variant802870a0a24da4c68707c662d96c30f938b1f3ea91e2252fc62a22e8e2f44380.lean#L383).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f03f5d86b80d11c091232ecfc47d21f951edf1ac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
