## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:94b27e84-b81f-ac4c-8d19-99f80c723523`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 295–306.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem denseRange_iff_denseRange_of_iSup_eq_top :
    DenseRange f ↔ ∀ i, DenseRange ((U i).1.restrictPreimage f) :=
  (IsOpenCover.mk hU).denseRange_iff_restrictPreimage

omit hU in
/--
Given a continuous map `f : X → Y` between topological spaces.
Suppose we have an open cover `U i` of the range of `f`, and a family of continuous maps `V i → X`
whose images are a cover of `X` that is coarser than the pullback of `U` under `f`.
To check that `f` is an embedding it suffices to check that `V i → Y` is an embedding for all `i`.

-- TODO : the lemma name does not match the content (there is no hypothesis `iSup_eq_top`!)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalAtTarget/Variant46368b4894802313a2023627424949feb014d51cc61746b8c6b62307e89551e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalAtTarget/Variant46368b4894802313a2023627424949feb014d51cc61746b8c6b62307e89551e7.lean#L295).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0ad3e2371bc619127432213694d3da7c0465c1d1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
