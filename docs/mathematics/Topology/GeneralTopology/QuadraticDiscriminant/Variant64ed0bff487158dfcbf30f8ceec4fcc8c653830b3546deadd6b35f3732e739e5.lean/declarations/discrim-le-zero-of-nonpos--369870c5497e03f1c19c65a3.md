## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:87b4d452-b6ea-02b7-cb00-f50f7a321319`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 149–155.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma discrim_le_zero_of_nonpos (h : ∀ x : K, a * x * x + b * x + c ≤ 0) : discrim a b c ≤ 0 :=
  discrim_neg a b c ▸ discrim_le_zero <| by simpa only [neg_mul, ← neg_add, neg_nonneg]
#align discrim_le_zero_of_nonpos discrim_le_zero_of_nonpos

/-- If a polynomial of degree 2 is always positive, then its discriminant is negative,
at least when the coefficient of the quadratic term is nonzero.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/QuadraticDiscriminant/Variant64ed0bff487158dfcbf30f8ceec4fcc8c653830b3546deadd6b35f3732e739e5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/QuadraticDiscriminant/Variant64ed0bff487158dfcbf30f8ceec4fcc8c653830b3546deadd6b35f3732e739e5.lean#L149).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `68e9c94b5f1dabb8d55e20bc9c075213debe675c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
