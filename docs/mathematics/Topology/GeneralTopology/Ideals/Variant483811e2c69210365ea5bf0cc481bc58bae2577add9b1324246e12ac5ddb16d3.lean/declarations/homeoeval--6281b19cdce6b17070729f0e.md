## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d53493b6563809e95db0bd922dbe163427aecbee6d9d4be674cf358dce90b6c7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 464–472.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def homeoEval : X ≃ₜ characterSpace 𝕜 C(X, 𝕜) :=
  @Continuous.homeoOfEquivCompactToT2 _ _ _ _ _ _
    { Equiv.ofBijective _ (continuousMapEval_bijective X 𝕜) with toFun := continuousMapEval X 𝕜 }
    (map_continuous (continuousMapEval X 𝕜))
#align weak_dual.character_space.homeo_eval WeakDual.CharacterSpace.homeoEval

end CharacterSpace

end WeakDual
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Ideals/Variant483811e2c69210365ea5bf0cc481bc58bae2577add9b1324246e12ac5ddb16d3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Ideals/Variant483811e2c69210365ea5bf0cc481bc58bae2577add9b1324246e12ac5ddb16d3.lean#L464).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fc3573465bb60179d20d277ab8d521840b175342` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
