## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4837dab6cf1d768e595f886699ae81c2cabd789fcbc9df723b18eb51ff2fe7f1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 135–144.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instContinuousSMul [ContinuousSMul 𝕜 𝕜] : ContinuousSMul 𝕜 (WeakBilin B) := by
  refine ⟨continuous_induced_rng.2 ?_⟩
  refine cast (congr_arg _ ?_) (continuous_fst.smul ((coeFn_continuous B).comp continuous_snd))
  ext
  simp only [Function.comp_apply, Pi.smul_apply, LinearMap.map_smulₛₗ, RingHom.id_apply,
    LinearMap.smul_apply]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/WeakBilin/Variant936d9f88477603c4cc685c71ce3086123cce3ad682becf30d56873d9db72a5cd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/WeakBilin/Variant936d9f88477603c4cc685c71ce3086123cce3ad682becf30d56873d9db72a5cd.lean#L135).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b60dc7bddcd73b8e6136c134fe374efa9d4ca242` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
