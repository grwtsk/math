## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:505e2a9a-406d-5878-1d1d-808b4ef2ecd8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 32–41.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem bump_abs_re_norm_le (z : ℂ) (hz : 1 ≤ ‖z‖) :
    ‖bumpLaplace z‖ ≤ 204288 * Real.exp |z.re| / ‖z‖ ^ 5 := by
  by_cases hr : 0 ≤ z.re
  · simpa only [abs_of_nonneg hr] using actual_bump_vertical_norm_le z hr hz
  · have hn : 0 ≤ (-z).re := by simp only [Complex.neg_re]; linarith
    have hb := actual_bump_vertical_norm_le (-z) hn (by simpa only [norm_neg] using hz)
    simpa only [bump_laplace_even, norm_neg, Complex.neg_re,
      abs_of_neg (lt_of_not_ge hr)] using hb

/-- The genuine ordinary complex source weight has this exact fixed-point normalized budget. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualZeroNormalizedCancellation/Variantb099bd8b1b6c7068d620359a228df4da4207263b88885417990a751910cf289d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualZeroNormalizedCancellation/Variantb099bd8b1b6c7068d620359a228df4da4207263b88885417990a751910cf289d.lean#L32).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ffe97b0854fc0f49e4fbf522d9e0813a541d1005` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
