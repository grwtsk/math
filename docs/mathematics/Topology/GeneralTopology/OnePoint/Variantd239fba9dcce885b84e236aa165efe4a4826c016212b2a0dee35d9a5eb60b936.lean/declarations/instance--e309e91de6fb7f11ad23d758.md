## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:51835ad51648864378b749714d2b1eba0c77b0e2130eeb8797206936e56d59bc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 577–599.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] [DiscreteTopology X] :
    TotallySeparatedSpace (OnePoint X) where
  isTotallySeparated_univ x _ y _ hxy := by
    cases x with
    | infty =>
      refine ⟨{y}ᶜ, {y}, isOpen_compl_singleton, ?_, hxy, rfl, (compl_union_self _).symm.subset,
        disjoint_compl_left⟩
      rw [OnePoint.isOpen_iff_of_notMem]
      exacts [isOpen_discrete _, hxy]
    | coe val =>
      refine ⟨{some val}, {some val}ᶜ, ?_, isOpen_compl_singleton, rfl, hxy.symm, by simp,
        disjoint_compl_right⟩
      rw [OnePoint.isOpen_iff_of_notMem]
      exacts [isOpen_discrete _, (Option.some_ne_none val).symm]

section Uniqueness

variable [TopologicalSpace Y] [T2Space Y] [CompactSpace Y]
  (y : Y) (f : X → Y) (hf : IsEmbedding f) (hy : range f = {y}ᶜ)

open scoped Classical in
/-- If `f` embeds `X` into a compact Hausdorff space `Y`, and has exactly one point outside its
range, then `(Y, f)` is the one-point compactification of `X`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/OnePoint/Variantd239fba9dcce885b84e236aa165efe4a4826c016212b2a0dee35d9a5eb60b936.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/OnePoint/Variantd239fba9dcce885b84e236aa165efe4a4826c016212b2a0dee35d9a5eb60b936.lean#L577).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d5f9fb250d6f477448cb9589dbca5563feacfc5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
