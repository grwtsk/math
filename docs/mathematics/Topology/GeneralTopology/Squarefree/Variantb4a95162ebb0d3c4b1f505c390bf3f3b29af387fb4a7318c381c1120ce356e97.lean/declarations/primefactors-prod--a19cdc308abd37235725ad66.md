## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bd1cf8de-e8ac-03ed-39ce-63f0515d9f85`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 375–382.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma primeFactors_prod (hs : ∀ p ∈ s, p.Prime) : primeFactors (∏ p ∈ s, p) = s := by
  have hn : ∏ p ∈ s, p ≠ 0 := prod_ne_zero_iff.2 fun p hp ↦ (hs _ hp).ne_zero
  ext p
  rw [mem_primeFactors_of_ne_zero hn, and_congr_right (fun hp ↦ hp.prime.dvd_finset_prod_iff _)]
  refine ⟨?_, fun hp ↦ ⟨hs _ hp, _, hp, dvd_rfl⟩⟩
  rintro ⟨hp, q, hq, hpq⟩
  rwa [← ((hs _ hq).dvd_iff_eq hp.ne_one).1 hpq]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Squarefree/Variantb4a95162ebb0d3c4b1f505c390bf3f3b29af387fb4a7318c381c1120ce356e97.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Squarefree/Variantb4a95162ebb0d3c4b1f505c390bf3f3b29af387fb4a7318c381c1120ce356e97.lean#L375).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `82768a42121429627bca02a10ce73934f81d1e6e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
