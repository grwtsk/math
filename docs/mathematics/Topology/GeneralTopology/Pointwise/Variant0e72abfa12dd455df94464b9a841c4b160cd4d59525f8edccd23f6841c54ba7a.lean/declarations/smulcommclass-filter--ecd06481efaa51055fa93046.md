## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9456be27ea933942fe0b64993aadf26abb05b7e5d55f441a37113cda6029206f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1246–1252.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance smulCommClass_filter' [SMul α γ] [SMul β γ] [SMulCommClass α β γ] :
    SMulCommClass α (Filter β) (Filter γ) :=
  ⟨fun a _ _ => map_map₂_distrib_right <| smul_comm a⟩
#align filter.smul_comm_class_filter' Filter.smulCommClass_filter'
#align filter.vadd_comm_class_filter' Filter.vaddCommClass_filter'

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Pointwise/Variant0e72abfa12dd455df94464b9a841c4b160cd4d59525f8edccd23f6841c54ba7a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Pointwise/Variant0e72abfa12dd455df94464b9a841c4b160cd4d59525f8edccd23f6841c54ba7a.lean#L1246).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `449673628534b0e914cd919cd9dfd65b15756cc9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
