## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f5f27744-d265-d490-5ccd-ae6921a40b86`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 48–81.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-! One may expect a version of `IsClosed.smul_left_of_isCompact` where `t` is compact and `s` is
closed, but such a lemma can't be true in this level of generality. For a counterexample, consider
`ℚ` acting on `ℝ` by translation, and let `s : Set ℚ := univ`, `t : set ℝ := {0}`. Then `s` is
closed and `t` is compact, but `s +ᵥ t` is the set of all rationals, which is definitely not
closed in `ℝ`.
To fix the proof, we would need to make two additional assumptions:
- for any `x ∈ t`, `s • {x}` is closed
- for any `x ∈ t`, there is a continuous function `g : s • {x} → s` such that, for all
  `y ∈ s • {x}`, we have `y = (g y) • x`
These are fairly specific hypotheses so we don't state this version of the lemmas, but an
interesting fact is that these two assumptions are verified in the case of a `NormedAddTorsor`
(or really, any `AddTorsor` with continuous `-ᵥ`). We prove this special case in
`IsClosed.vadd_right_of_isCompact`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Pointwise/Varianta1d9810c22a6c5c38d0f39121582f5d5caff4aeb4cde7c757cb153baadda5aa3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Pointwise/Varianta1d9810c22a6c5c38d0f39121582f5d5caff4aeb4cde7c757cb153baadda5aa3.lean#L48).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
