## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:475ed6e1c069cc3f7e6ca2f06c4c656f1cc4a60090e8fe61e3bb602f96f45905`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 378–385.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toLocallyBoundedMap (f : α → β) (hf : LipschitzWith K f) : LocallyBoundedMap α β :=
  LocallyBoundedMap.ofMapBounded f fun _s hs =>
    let ⟨C, hC⟩ := Metric.isBounded_iff.1 hs
    Metric.isBounded_iff.2 ⟨K * C, ball_image_iff.2 fun _x hx => ball_image_iff.2 fun _y hy =>
      hf.dist_le_mul_of_le (hC hx hy)⟩
#align lipschitz_with.to_locally_bounded_map LipschitzWith.toLocallyBoundedMap

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lipschitz/Variantedc75c5232a1f26d9d918eff191ce507687d885aa405dfd5332d3dc9873e2878.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lipschitz/Variantedc75c5232a1f26d9d918eff191ce507687d885aa405dfd5332d3dc9873e2878.lean#L378).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `34369456d4dd5f43a161312693694886cff74203` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
