## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f72d8d14-1454-4c29-ca88-85665c38a473`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 224–248.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measure_closedBall_pos (x : X) {r : ℝ≥0∞} (hr : r ≠ 0) : 0 < μ (closedBall x r) :=
  (measure_ball_pos μ x hr).trans_le (measure_mono ball_subset_closedBall)

/-! ## Meagre sets and measure zero
In general, neither of meagre and measure zero implies the other.
- The set of Liouville numbers is a Lebesgue measure zero subset of ℝ, but is not meagre.
(In fact, its complement is meagre. See `Real.disjoint_residual_ae`.)

- The complement of the set of Liouville numbers in $[0,1]$ is meagre and has measure 1.
For another counterexample, for all $α ∈ (0,1)$, there is a generalised Cantor set $C ⊆ [0,1]$
of measure `α`. Cantor sets are nowhere dense (hence meagre). Taking a countable union of
fat Cantor sets whose measure approaches 1 even yields a meagre set of measure 1.

However, with respect to a measure which is positive on non-empty open sets, *closed* measure
zero sets are nowhere dense and σ-compact measure zero sets in a Hausdorff space are meagre.

/-- A *closed* measure zero subset is nowhere dense. (Closedness is required: for instance, the
rational numbers are countable (thus have measure zero), but are dense (hence not nowhere dense). -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/OpenPos/Variant692506a2bab7937f9ea807edda18fea1e713733d33cf6fabcb99e076992f6fbc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/OpenPos/Variant692506a2bab7937f9ea807edda18fea1e713733d33cf6fabcb99e076992f6fbc.lean#L224).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `37469dd4c1fe3cde01c3788b00c48d474fdee7c6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
