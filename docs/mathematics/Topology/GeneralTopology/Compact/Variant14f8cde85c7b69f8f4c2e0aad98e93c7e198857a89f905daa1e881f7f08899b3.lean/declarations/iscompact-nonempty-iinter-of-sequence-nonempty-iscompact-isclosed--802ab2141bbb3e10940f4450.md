## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0d70b9c8-1a46-6eed-a6f2-824051bc7a38`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 346–355.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsCompact.nonempty_iInter_of_sequence_nonempty_isCompact_isClosed (t : ℕ → Set X)
    (htd : ∀ i, t (i + 1) ⊆ t i) (htn : ∀ i, (t i).Nonempty) (ht0 : IsCompact (t 0))
    (htcl : ∀ i, IsClosed (t i)) : (⋂ i, t i).Nonempty :=
  have tmono : Antitone t := antitone_nat_of_succ_le htd
  have htd : Directed (· ⊇ ·) t := tmono.directed_ge
  have : ∀ i, t i ⊆ t 0 := fun i => tmono <| Nat.zero_le i
  have htc : ∀ i, IsCompact (t i) := fun i => ht0.of_isClosed_subset (htcl i) (this i)

/-- For every open cover of a compact set, there exists a finite subcover. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variant14f8cde85c7b69f8f4c2e0aad98e93c7e198857a89f905daa1e881f7f08899b3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variant14f8cde85c7b69f8f4c2e0aad98e93c7e198857a89f905daa1e881f7f08899b3.lean#L346).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27af4af59e3a778358fce087bbe1c024f6c5d810` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
