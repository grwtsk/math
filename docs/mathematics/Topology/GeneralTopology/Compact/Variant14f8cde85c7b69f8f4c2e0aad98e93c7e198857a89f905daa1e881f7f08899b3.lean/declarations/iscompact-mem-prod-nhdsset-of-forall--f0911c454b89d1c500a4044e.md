## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5d9ae513-f9db-50f1-2af5-2aba32fdf65f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 431–436.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsCompact.mem_prod_nhdsSet_of_forall {K : Set Y} {X} {l : Filter X} {s : Set (X × Y)}
    (hK : IsCompact K) (hs : ∀ y ∈ K, s ∈ l ×ˢ 𝓝 y) : s ∈ l ×ˢ 𝓝ˢ K :=
  (hK.prod_nhdsSet_eq_biSup l).symm ▸ by simpa using hs

-- TODO: Is there a way to prove directly the `inf` version and then deduce the `Prod` one ?
-- That would seem a bit more natural.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variant14f8cde85c7b69f8f4c2e0aad98e93c7e198857a89f905daa1e881f7f08899b3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variant14f8cde85c7b69f8f4c2e0aad98e93c7e198857a89f905daa1e881f7f08899b3.lean#L431).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27af4af59e3a778358fce087bbe1c024f6c5d810` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
