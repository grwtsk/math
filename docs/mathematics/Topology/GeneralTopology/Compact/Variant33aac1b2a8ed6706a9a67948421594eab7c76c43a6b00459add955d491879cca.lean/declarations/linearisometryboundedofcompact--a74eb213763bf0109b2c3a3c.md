## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ae2cd86574ce40fb71f9a3bc37cb89c1c6a795fe8f2f23a679bbd5fc7b95a12b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 281–292.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def linearIsometryBoundedOfCompact : C(α, E) ≃ₗᵢ[𝕜] α →ᵇ E :=
  { addEquivBoundedOfCompact α E with
    map_smul' := fun c f => by
      ext
      norm_cast
    norm_map' := fun f => rfl }
#align continuous_map.linear_isometry_bounded_of_compact ContinuousMap.linearIsometryBoundedOfCompact

variable {α E}

-- to match `BoundedContinuousFunction.evalClm`
/-- The evaluation at a point, as a continuous linear map from `C(α, 𝕜)` to `𝕜`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variant33aac1b2a8ed6706a9a67948421594eab7c76c43a6b00459add955d491879cca.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variant33aac1b2a8ed6706a9a67948421594eab7c76c43a6b00459add955d491879cca.lean#L281).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `44372ea4077fd0b88ed63fdb6296bc228aab8e6c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
