## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f885c4c3-650d-392f-bbf4-33d272a86d33`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 417–427.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsCompact.mem_inf_nhdsSet_of_forall {K : Set X} {l : Filter X} {s : Set X}
    (hK : IsCompact K) (hs : ∀ y ∈ K, s ∈ l ⊓ 𝓝 y) : s ∈ l ⊓ 𝓝ˢ K :=
  (hK.inf_nhdsSet_eq_biSup l).symm ▸ by simpa using hs

/-- To show that `∀ y ∈ K, P x y` holds for `x` close enough to `x₀` when `K` is compact,
it is sufficient to show that for all `y₀ ∈ K` there `P x y` holds for `(x, y)` close enough
to `(x₀, y₀)`.

Provided for backwards compatibility,
see `IsCompact.mem_prod_nhdsSet_of_forall` for a stronger statement.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variant680399348f336ba1fa96232806e10e1101b6d59c556db000a6fc121d40daf836.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variant680399348f336ba1fa96232806e10e1101b6d59c556db000a6fc121d40daf836.lean#L417).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ee81e41eedfe82ab91053ef242557a393994b7e9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
