## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:65cb8e1c-d1c7-d3f0-1504-20431ec7268a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 511–525.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
theorem eq_Icc_of_connected_compact {s : Set α} (h₁ : IsConnected s) (h₂ : IsCompact s) :
    s = Icc (sInf s) (sSup s) :=
  eq_Icc_csInf_csSup_of_connected_bdd_closed h₁ h₂.bddBelow h₂.bddAbove h₂.isClosed

/-- If `f : γ → β → α` is a function that is continuous as a function on `γ × β`, `α` is a
conditionally complete linear order, and `K : Set β` is a compact set, then
`fun x ↦ sSup (f x '' K)` is a continuous function. -/
/- TODO: generalize. The following version seems to be true:
```
theorem IsCompact.tendsto_sSup {f : γ → β → α} {g : β → α} {K : Set β} {l : Filter γ}
    (hK : IsCompact K) (hf : ∀ y ∈ K, Tendsto ↿f (l ×ˢ 𝓝[K] y) (𝓝 (g y)))
    (hgc : ContinuousOn g K) :
    Tendsto (fun x => sSup (f x '' K)) l (𝓝 (sSup (g '' K))) := _
```
Moreover, it seems that `hgc` follows from `hf` (Yury Kudryashov). -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variant87ac3e5af5bb0f395d4303da3a22c1cef060eaef4d92bb2166959d0982af8dc8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variant87ac3e5af5bb0f395d4303da3a22c1cef060eaef4d92bb2166959d0982af8dc8.lean#L511).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a5c4db4ebe25b6b05bce151f0342be15bc9679e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
