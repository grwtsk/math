## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0a225e13-f66b-e97d-9959-1323af4d51ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 269–277.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsCompact.elim_finite_subfamily_closed {ι : Type v} (hs : IsCompact s)
    (t : ι → Set X) (htc : ∀ i, IsClosed (t i)) (hst : (s ∩ ⋂ i, t i) = ∅) :
    ∃ u : Finset ι, (s ∩ ⋂ i ∈ u, t i) = ∅ :=
  hs.elim_directed_family_closed _ (fun _ ↦ isClosed_biInter fun _ _ ↦ htc _)
    (by rwa [← iInter_eq_iInter_finset])
    (directed_of_isDirected_le fun _ _ h ↦ biInter_subset_biInter_left h)

/-- To show that a compact set intersects the intersection of a family of closed sets,
  it is sufficient to show that it intersects every finite subfamily. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variantf4afc5d05c1ad4a4cd2e2bf530b09036091528166b6644659aef1924ac27f683.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variantf4afc5d05c1ad4a4cd2e2bf530b09036091528166b6644659aef1924ac27f683.lean#L269).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `50faf667b485e24757b73ff5809b3fb7d2f4a5ba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
