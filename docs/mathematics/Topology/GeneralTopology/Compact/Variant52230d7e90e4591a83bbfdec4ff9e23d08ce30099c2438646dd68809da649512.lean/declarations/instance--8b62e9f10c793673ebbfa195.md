## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:50ca2f96c0e1e19c5c258ebf8137a757c89972d3d37995a2d1bb98b7e55182b0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 545–563.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [CompactSpace α] [CstarRing β] : CstarRing C(α, β) where
  norm_star_mul_self {f} := by
    refine' le_antisymm _ _
    · rw [← sq, ContinuousMap.norm_le _ (sq_nonneg _)]
      intro x
      simp only [ContinuousMap.coe_mul, coe_star, Pi.mul_apply, Pi.star_apply,
        CstarRing.norm_star_mul_self, ← sq]
      refine' sq_le_sq' _ _
      · linarith [norm_nonneg (f x), norm_nonneg f]
      · exact ContinuousMap.norm_coe_le_norm f x
    · rw [← sq, ← Real.le_sqrt (norm_nonneg _) (norm_nonneg _),
        ContinuousMap.norm_le _ (Real.sqrt_nonneg _)]
      intro x
      rw [Real.le_sqrt (norm_nonneg _) (norm_nonneg _), sq, ← CstarRing.norm_star_mul_self]
      exact ContinuousMap.norm_coe_le_norm (star f * f) x

end CstarRing

end ContinuousMap
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variant52230d7e90e4591a83bbfdec4ff9e23d08ce30099c2438646dd68809da649512.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variant52230d7e90e4591a83bbfdec4ff9e23d08ce30099c2438646dd68809da649512.lean#L545).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d36bc223a458d8d2ecf66dae972ae75ea3bddde6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
