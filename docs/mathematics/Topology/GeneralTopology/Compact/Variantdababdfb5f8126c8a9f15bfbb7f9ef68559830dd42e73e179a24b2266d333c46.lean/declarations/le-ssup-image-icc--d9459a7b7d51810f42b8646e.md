## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:24addf0f-27da-9608-ddd3-972a8999809a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 580–587.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem le_sSup_image_Icc (h : ContinuousOn f <| Icc a b) (hc : c ∈ Icc a b) :
    f c ≤ sSup (f '' Icc a b) := by
  have := mem_image_of_mem f hc
  rw [h.image_Icc (hc.1.trans hc.2)] at this
  exact this.2
#align continuous_on.le_Sup_image_Icc ContinuousOn.le_sSup_image_Icc

end ContinuousOn
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variantdababdfb5f8126c8a9f15bfbb7f9ef68559830dd42e73e179a24b2266d333c46.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variantdababdfb5f8126c8a9f15bfbb7f9ef68559830dd42e73e179a24b2266d333c46.lean#L580).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
