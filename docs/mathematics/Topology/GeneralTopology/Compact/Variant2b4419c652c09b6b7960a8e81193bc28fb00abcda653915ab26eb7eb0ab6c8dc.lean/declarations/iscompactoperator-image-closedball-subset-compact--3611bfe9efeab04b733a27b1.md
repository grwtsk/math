## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0f13a29a-0cb5-6cbb-7058-90250e0b4602`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 140–144.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsCompactOperator.image_closedBall_subset_compact [ContinuousConstSMul 𝕜₂ M₂]
    {f : M₁ →ₛₗ[σ₁₂] M₂} (hf : IsCompactOperator f) (r : ℝ) :
    ∃ K : Set M₂, IsCompact K ∧ f '' Metric.closedBall 0 r ⊆ K :=
  hf.image_subset_compact_of_isVonNBounded (NormedSpace.isVonNBounded_closedBall 𝕜₁ M₁ r)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variant2b4419c652c09b6b7960a8e81193bc28fb00abcda653915ab26eb7eb0ab6c8dc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Compact/Variant2b4419c652c09b6b7960a8e81193bc28fb00abcda653915ab26eb7eb0ab6c8dc.lean#L140).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a092fcc377f7e54eb29c593926656c7c86bb3acf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
