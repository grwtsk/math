## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a903902a-fd9f-6cb2-f719-0522cb1072e9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 539–545.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Filter.EventuallyEq.isLocalExtr_iff {f g : α → β} {a : α} (heq : f =ᶠ[𝓝 a] g) :
    IsLocalExtr f a ↔ IsLocalExtr g a :=
  heq.isExtrFilter_iff heq.eq_of_nhds

end Eventually

/-- If `f` is monotone to the left and antitone to the right, then it has a local maximum. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalExtr/Variant0b64e73e9ac4652d506f58100712d513072b256e6014c510cd3b7fb192b15af4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalExtr/Variant0b64e73e9ac4652d506f58100712d513072b256e6014c510cd3b7fb192b15af4.lean#L539).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
