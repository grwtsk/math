## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9622cbf3-3c16-2ab6-f8c6-db75c9fc7278`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 306–321.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsLocalExtrOn.comp_continuousOn [TopologicalSpace δ] {t : Set α} {s : Set δ} (g : δ → α)
    {b : δ} (hf : IsLocalExtrOn f t (g b)) (hst : s ⊆ g ⁻¹' t) (hg : ContinuousOn g s)
    (hb : b ∈ s) : IsLocalExtrOn (f ∘ g) s b :=
  hf.elim (fun hf => (hf.comp_continuousOn hst hg hb).isExtr) fun hf =>
    (IsLocalMaxOn.comp_continuousOn hf hst hg hb).isExtr

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalExtr/Variant0b64e73e9ac4652d506f58100712d513072b256e6014c510cd3b7fb192b15af4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalExtr/Variant0b64e73e9ac4652d506f58100712d513072b256e6014c510cd3b7fb192b15af4.lean#L306).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ff8cad5ca9897f8d1087a143393dd6afdafb4951` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
