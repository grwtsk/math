## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9a1d99b1-7aae-ce25-97f0-113f5b98492f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 397–405.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Subspace.biUnion_ne_univ_of_top_notMem (hs : ⊤ ∉ s) : ⋃ p ∈ s, (p : Set E) ≠ Set.univ := by
  intro hcovers
  have ⟨p, hp, hfi⟩ := Submodule.exists_finiteIndex_of_cover hcovers
  have : Finite (E ⧸ p) := AddSubgroup.finite_quotient_of_finiteIndex
  have : Nontrivial (E ⧸ p) := Submodule.Quotient.nontrivial_iff.mpr (ne_of_mem_of_not_mem hp hs)
  have : Infinite (E ⧸ p) := Module.Free.infinite k (E ⧸ p)
  exact not_finite (E ⧸ p)

/-- A vector space over an infinite field cannot be a finite union of proper subspaces. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CosetCover/Variant91888c9246e6329609dbd2b85fc09f35919870d8ed8f13986c31204b6fc735a6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CosetCover/Variant91888c9246e6329609dbd2b85fc09f35919870d8ed8f13986c31204b6fc735a6.lean#L397).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8efd95c175269d3b22732de06f7c23209f08a3de` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
