## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8d78dee9-5e2e-090f-818c-c4700ab988b4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 48–56.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isProperMap_iff_tendsto_cocompact :
    IsProperMap f ↔ Continuous f ∧ Tendsto f (cocompact X) (cocompact Y) := by
  simp_rw [isProperMap_iff_isCompact_preimage,
    hasBasis_cocompact.tendsto_right_iff, ← mem_preimage, eventually_mem_set, preimage_compl]
  refine and_congr_right fun f_cont ↦
    ⟨fun H K hK ↦ (H hK).compl_mem_cocompact, fun H K hK ↦ ?_⟩
  rcases mem_cocompact.mp (H K hK) with ⟨K', hK', hK'y⟩
  exact hK'.of_isClosed_subset (hK.isClosed.preimage f_cont)
    (compl_le_compl_iff_le.mp hK'y)
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactlyGenerated/Variant9986f6f98390d7cb1c6ba12eadfbac1787897eb4303e5ef399ee48f2430bbf7c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactlyGenerated/Variant9986f6f98390d7cb1c6ba12eadfbac1787897eb4303e5ef399ee48f2430bbf7c.lean#L48).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `01f76786313e1f8cee54af876e6ed4b56356df4e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
