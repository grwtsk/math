## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bd3c18f3-30b7-fbe2-9a52-eadf03bd5352`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 834–839.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma IsBase.spanning_of_superset (hB : M.IsBase B) (hBX : B ⊆ X) (hX : X ⊆ M.E := by aesop_mat) :
    M.Spanning X :=
  hB.spanning.superset hBX

/-- A version of `Matroid.spanning_iff_exists_isBase_subset` in which the `S ⊆ M.E` condition
appears in the RHS of the equivalence rather than as a hypothesis. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Closure/Variant2f1aea834be845e7d006dde57a4682ad123c3a67a78d296e86a90c7cf754c601.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Closure/Variant2f1aea834be845e7d006dde57a4682ad123c3a67a78d296e86a90c7cf754c601.lean#L834).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `47c1114aae9848672188b2156ac53232436a03d8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
