## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6eeb6c9e-a0f1-7c19-bac5-45d18a874a28`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 556–562.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Indep.inter_isBasis_iInter [Nonempty ι] {X : ι → Set α} (hI : M.Indep I)
    (h : ∀ i, M.IsBasis ((X i) ∩ I) (X i)) : M.IsBasis ((⋂ i, X i) ∩ I) (⋂ i, X i) := by
  convert hI.inter_isBasis_biInter (ι := PLift ι) univ_nonempty (X := fun i ↦ X i.down)
    (by simpa using fun (i : PLift ι) ↦ h i.down) <;>
  · simp only [mem_univ, iInter_true]
    exact (iInter_plift_down X).symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Closure/Variant2f1aea834be845e7d006dde57a4682ad123c3a67a78d296e86a90c7cf754c601.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Closure/Variant2f1aea834be845e7d006dde57a4682ad123c3a67a78d296e86a90c7cf754c601.lean#L556).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `47c1114aae9848672188b2156ac53232436a03d8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
