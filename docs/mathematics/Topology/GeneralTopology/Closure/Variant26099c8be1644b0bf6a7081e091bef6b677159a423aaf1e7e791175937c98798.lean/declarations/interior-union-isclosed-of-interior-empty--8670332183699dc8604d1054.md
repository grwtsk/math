## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:585ccd7c-890a-7b0c-2426-5a414c8218f4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–164.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem interior_union_isClosed_of_interior_empty (h₁ : IsClosed s)
    (h₂ : interior t = ∅) : interior (s ∪ t) = interior s :=
  have : interior (s ∪ t) ⊆ s := fun x ⟨u, ⟨(hu₁ : IsOpen u), (hu₂ : u ⊆ s ∪ t)⟩, (hx₁ : x ∈ u)⟩ =>
    by_contradiction fun hx₂ : x ∉ s =>
      have : u \ s ⊆ t := fun _ ⟨h₁, h₂⟩ => Or.resolve_left (hu₂ h₁) h₂
      have : u \ s ⊆ interior t := by rwa [(IsOpen.sdiff hu₁ h₁).subset_interior_iff]
      have : u \ s ⊆ ∅ := by rwa [h₂] at this
      this ⟨hx₁, hx₂⟩
  Subset.antisymm (interior_maximal this isOpen_interior) (interior_mono subset_union_left)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Closure/Variant26099c8be1644b0bf6a7081e091bef6b677159a423aaf1e7e791175937c98798.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Closure/Variant26099c8be1644b0bf6a7081e091bef6b677159a423aaf1e7e791175937c98798.lean#L155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `57e1d26b7e1be608090849561d7ca1ca683f2e76` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
