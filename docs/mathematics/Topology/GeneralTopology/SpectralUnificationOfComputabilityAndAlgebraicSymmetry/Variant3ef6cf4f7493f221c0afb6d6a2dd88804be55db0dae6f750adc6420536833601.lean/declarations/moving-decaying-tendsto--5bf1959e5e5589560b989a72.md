## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cebac02b-2af5-e59c-1aeb-9d9033778ea7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 142–152.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem moving_decaying_tendsto :
    Tendsto (fun A : ℝ => (4160 / 3) * (Real.log A / A + 1 / A)) atTop (𝓝 0) := by
  have hl : Tendsto (fun A : ℝ => Real.log A / A) atTop (𝓝 0) := by
    simpa using Real.tendsto_pow_log_div_mul_add_atTop 1 0 1 one_ne_zero
  have hi : Tendsto (fun A : ℝ => 1 / A) atTop (𝓝 0) := by
    simpa only [one_div] using (tendsto_inv_atTop_zero :
      Tendsto (fun A : ℝ => A⁻¹) atTop (𝓝 0))
  simpa using (hl.add hi).const_mul (4160 / 3)

/-- The actual prefix estimate keeps the exponentially growing envelope inside
the integral. It holds for every nonnegative real prefix length. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variant3ef6cf4f7493f221c0afb6d6a2dd88804be55db0dae6f750adc6420536833601.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variant3ef6cf4f7493f221c0afb6d6a2dd88804be55db0dae6f750adc6420536833601.lean#L142).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `12a4fec983b5bff7014bd7e3cb9c75becb9ab063` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
