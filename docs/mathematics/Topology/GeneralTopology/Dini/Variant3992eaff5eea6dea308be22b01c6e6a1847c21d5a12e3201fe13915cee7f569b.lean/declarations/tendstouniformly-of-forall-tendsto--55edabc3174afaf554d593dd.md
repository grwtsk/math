## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:47a87463-ccfc-c56c-3956-b7ae77ed539e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–98.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma tendstoUniformly_of_forall_tendsto [CompactSpace α] (hF_cont : ∀ i, Continuous (F i))
    (hF_mono : Monotone F) (hf : Continuous f) (h_tendsto : ∀ x, Tendsto (F · x) atTop (𝓝 (f x))) :
    TendstoUniformly F f atTop :=
  tendstoLocallyUniformly_iff_tendstoUniformly_of_compactSpace.mp <|
    tendstoLocallyUniformly_of_forall_tendsto hF_cont hF_mono hf h_tendsto

/-- **Dini's theorem**: if `F n` is a monotone increasing collection of continuous functions on a
compact set `s` converging pointwise to a continuous function `f`, then `F n` converges uniformly
to `f`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Dini/Variant3992eaff5eea6dea308be22b01c6e6a1847c21d5a12e3201fe13915cee7f569b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Dini/Variant3992eaff5eea6dea308be22b01c6e6a1847c21d5a12e3201fe13915cee7f569b.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1ed32fdb37f0441190e19fde0d0eaad686d5e566` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
