## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bb594086-76af-a3be-fcce-6af717e719c4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 37–47.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma prod_mulIndicator_subset_of_eq_one [One α] (f : ι → α) (g : ι → α → β) {s t : Finset ι}
    (h : s ⊆ t) (hg : ∀ a, g a 1 = 1) :
    ∏ i ∈ t, g i (mulIndicator ↑s f i) = ∏ i ∈ s, g i (f i) := by
  calc
    _ = ∏ i ∈ s, g i (mulIndicator ↑s f i) := by rw [prod_subset h fun i _ hn ↦ by simp [hn, hg]]
    _ = _ := prod_congr rfl fun i hi ↦ congr_arg _ <| mulIndicator_of_mem hi f

/-- Taking the product of an indicator function over a possibly larger finset is the same as
taking the original function over the original finset. -/
@[to_additive "Summing an indicator function over a possibly larger `Finset` is the same as summing
  the original function over the original finset."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Indicator/Variant2be3ca2152f720d73094da3da407a7cb6364b3377f41b5f6db1f17bfc58ebbb2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Indicator/Variant2be3ca2152f720d73094da3da407a7cb6364b3377f41b5f6db1f17bfc58ebbb2.lean#L37).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f4cb8e02fa4739e91cc8f293b3d4c9b691f1811d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
