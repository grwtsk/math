## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ac4fee5d-98e3-235a-b788-4f8b7708e9a1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 83–95.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma tendsto_measure_of_tendsto_indicator {μ : Measure α}
    (As_mble : ∀ i, MeasurableSet (As i)) {B : Set α} (B_mble : MeasurableSet B)
    (B_finmeas : μ B ≠ ∞) (As_le_B : ∀ᶠ i in L, As i ⊆ B)
    (h_lim : ∀ x, ∀ᶠ i in L, x ∈ As i ↔ x ∈ A) :

        (ae_of_all μ h_lim)
  exact measurableSet_of_tendsto_indicator L As_mble h_lim

/-- If `μ` is a finite measure and the indicators of measurable sets `Aᵢ` tend pointwise to
the indicator of a set `A`, then the measures `μ Aᵢ` tend to the measure `μ A`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Indicator/Variant5463f00bc83972848eebff56390fad9b46e355be833bc826cf21bff01716e620.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Indicator/Variant5463f00bc83972848eebff56390fad9b46e355be833bc826cf21bff01716e620.lean#L83).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b9ee68f8dd4c7c2899ebb02d71276b18e36e0b13` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
