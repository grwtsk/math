## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c1e84155-c528-a37a-964c-e992cb33ffaa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 480–485.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem intermediate_value_Icc {a b : α} (hab : a ≤ b) {f : α → δ} (hf : ContinuousOn f (Icc a b)) :
    Icc (f a) (f b) ⊆ f '' Icc a b :=
  isPreconnected_Icc.intermediate_value (left_mem_Icc.2 hab) (right_mem_Icc.2 hab) hf

/-- **Intermediate Value Theorem** for continuous functions on closed intervals, case
`f a ≥ t ≥ f b`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/IntermediateValue/Variant691bb64295eb7efd01b2f325ed4d886a7d3e2d1156eb56c28bfbe7ea85e36c13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/IntermediateValue/Variant691bb64295eb7efd01b2f325ed4d886a7d3e2d1156eb56c28bfbe7ea85e36c13.lean#L480).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0bdb0f39f02c29a5c37460dd0e8f870530eb8261` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
