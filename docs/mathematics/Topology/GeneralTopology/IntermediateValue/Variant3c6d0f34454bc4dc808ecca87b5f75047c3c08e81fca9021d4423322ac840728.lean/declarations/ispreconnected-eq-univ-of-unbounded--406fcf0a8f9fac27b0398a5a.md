## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6059f889-7fbd-7084-b12d-4e7e481290ff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 221–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsPreconnected.eq_univ_of_unbounded {s : Set α} (hs : IsPreconnected s) (hb : ¬BddBelow s)
    (ha : ¬BddAbove s) : s = univ := by
  refine eq_univ_of_forall fun x => ?_
  obtain ⟨y, ys, hy⟩ : ∃ y ∈ s, y < x := not_bddBelow_iff.1 hb x
  obtain ⟨z, zs, hz⟩ : ∃ z ∈ s, x < z := not_bddAbove_iff.1 ha x
  exact hs.Icc_subset ys zs ⟨le_of_lt hy, le_of_lt hz⟩

end

variable {α : Type u} [TopologicalSpace α]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/IntermediateValue/Variant3c6d0f34454bc4dc808ecca87b5f75047c3c08e81fca9021d4423322ac840728.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/IntermediateValue/Variant3c6d0f34454bc4dc808ecca87b5f75047c3c08e81fca9021d4423322ac840728.lean#L221).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c5bf572783901ffd21b3561e225ac461290c80b1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
