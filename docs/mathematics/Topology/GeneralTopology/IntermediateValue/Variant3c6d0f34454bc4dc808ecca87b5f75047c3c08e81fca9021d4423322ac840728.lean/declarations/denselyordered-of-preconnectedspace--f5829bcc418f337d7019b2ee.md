## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:45cb77d0-7d9e-e974-cb3b-ce68784f8c0f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 232–242.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem denselyOrdered_of_preconnectedSpace [LinearOrder α] [OrderTopology α]
    [PreconnectedSpace α] : DenselyOrdered α where
  dense x y hxy := by
    suffices (Iio y ∩ Ioi x).Nonempty by grind [Set.inter_nonempty_iff_exists_left]
    exact nonempty_inter (isOpen_Iio' y) (isOpen_Ioi' x) (Set.Iio_union_Ioi_of_lt hxy)
      ⟨x, Set.mem_Iio.mpr hxy⟩ ⟨y, Set.mem_Ioi.mpr hxy⟩

variable [ConditionallyCompleteLinearOrder α] [OrderTopology α]

/-- A bounded connected subset of a conditionally complete linear order includes the open interval
`(Inf s, Sup s)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/IntermediateValue/Variant3c6d0f34454bc4dc808ecca87b5f75047c3c08e81fca9021d4423322ac840728.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/IntermediateValue/Variant3c6d0f34454bc4dc808ecca87b5f75047c3c08e81fca9021d4423322ac840728.lean#L232).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c5bf572783901ffd21b3561e225ac461290c80b1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
