## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d5ca7afd-295f-6ae6-0b59-8b42d7657467`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 139–144.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsPreconnected.intermediate_value_Ioc {s : Set X} (hs : IsPreconnected s) {a : X}
    {l : Filter X} (ha : a ∈ s) [NeBot l] (hl : l ≤ 𝓟 s) {f : X → α} (hf : ContinuousOn f s) {v : α}
    (ht : Tendsto f l (𝓝 v)) : Ioc v (f a) ⊆ f '' s := fun _ h =>
  (hs.intermediate_value₂_eventually₁ ha hl continuousOn_const hf h.2
    (ht.eventually_le_const h.1)).imp fun _ h => h.imp_right Eq.symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/IntermediateValue/Variant3c6d0f34454bc4dc808ecca87b5f75047c3c08e81fca9021d4423322ac840728.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/IntermediateValue/Variant3c6d0f34454bc4dc808ecca87b5f75047c3c08e81fca9021d4423322ac840728.lean#L139).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c5bf572783901ffd21b3561e225ac461290c80b1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
