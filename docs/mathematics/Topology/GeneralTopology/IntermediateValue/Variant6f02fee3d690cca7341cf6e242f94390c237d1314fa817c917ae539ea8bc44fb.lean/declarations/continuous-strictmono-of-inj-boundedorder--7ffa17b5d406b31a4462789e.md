## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2751cd83-2832-f43a-8afe-fcd218e2bb8d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 623–631.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Continuous.strictMono_of_inj_boundedOrder' [BoundedOrder α] {f : α → δ}
    (hf_c : Continuous f) (hf_i : Injective f) : StrictMono f ∨ StrictAnti f :=
  (le_total (f ⊥) (f ⊤)).imp
    (hf_c.strictMono_of_inj_boundedOrder · hf_i)
    (hf_c.strictAnti_of_inj_boundedOrder · hf_i)

/-- Suppose `α` is equipped with a conditionally complete linear dense order and `f : α → δ` is
continuous and injective. Then `f` is strictly monotone (increasing) if
it is strictly monotone (increasing) on some closed interval `[a, b]`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/IntermediateValue/Variant6f02fee3d690cca7341cf6e242f94390c237d1314fa817c917ae539ea8bc44fb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/IntermediateValue/Variant6f02fee3d690cca7341cf6e242f94390c237d1314fa817c917ae539ea8bc44fb.lean#L623).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9815678598a7e8bdb10cb9f67f9778c32c651f10` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
