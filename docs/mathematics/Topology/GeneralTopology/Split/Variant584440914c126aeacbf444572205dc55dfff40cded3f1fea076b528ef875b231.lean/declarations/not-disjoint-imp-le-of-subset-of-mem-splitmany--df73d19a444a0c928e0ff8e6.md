## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d7a5c689-bab4-24e2-54b9-581923cdcbf0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 259–282.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

section Finite

variable [Finite ι]

/-- Let `s` be a finite set of boxes in `ℝⁿ = ι → ℝ`. Then there exists a finite set `t₀` of
hyperplanes (namely, the set of all hyperfaces of boxes in `s`) such that for any `t ⊇ t₀`
and any box `I` in `ℝⁿ` the following holds. The hyperplanes from `t` split `I` into subboxes.
Let `J'` be one of them, and let `J` be one of the boxes in `s`. If these boxes have a nonempty
intersection, then `J' ≤ J`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Split/Variant584440914c126aeacbf444572205dc55dfff40cded3f1fea076b528ef875b231.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Split/Variant584440914c126aeacbf444572205dc55dfff40cded3f1fea076b528ef875b231.lean#L259).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `33a14ef0e63282c67eb3a38b11d70565391baa01` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
