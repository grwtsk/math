## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7ed5d46b-448e-894f-7cb8-ad0529ba239a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 219–225.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem restrict_split (h : I ≤ J) (i : ι) (x : ℝ) : (split J i x).restrict I = split I i x := by
  refine ((isPartitionSplit J i x).restrict h).eq_of_boxes_subset ?_
  simp only [Finset.subset_iff, mem_boxes, mem_restrict', mem_split_iff']
  have : ∀ s, (I ∩ s : Set (ι → ℝ)) ⊆ J := fun s => inter_subset_left.trans h
  rintro J₁ ⟨J₂, H₂ | H₂, H₁⟩ <;> [left; right] <;>
    simp [H₁, H₂, inter_left_comm (I : Set (ι → ℝ)), this]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Split/Variantf5ea0eda0c928b319e42a0fe4007211ccf62c78bb5b876b347194d84e0fe9b72.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Split/Variantf5ea0eda0c928b319e42a0fe4007211ccf62c78bb5b876b347194d84e0fe9b72.lean#L219).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c6797b4068735b75a0d033c627995fe25d26d24b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
