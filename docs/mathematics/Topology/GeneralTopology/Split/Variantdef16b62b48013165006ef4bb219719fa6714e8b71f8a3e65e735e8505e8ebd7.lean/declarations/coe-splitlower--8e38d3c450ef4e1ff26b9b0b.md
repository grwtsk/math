## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cbd387cb-b58f-26db-d99a-d1b04760a1e1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 67–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coe_splitLower : (splitLower I i x : Set (ι → ℝ)) = ↑I ∩ { y | y i ≤ x } := by
  rw [splitLower, coe_mk']
  ext y
  simp only [mem_univ_pi, mem_Ioc, mem_inter_iff, mem_coe, mem_setOf_eq, forall_and, ← Pi.le_def,
    le_update_iff, le_min_iff, and_assoc, and_forall_ne (p := fun j => y j ≤ upper I j) i, mem_def]
  rw [and_comm (a := y i ≤ x)]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Split/Variantdef16b62b48013165006ef4bb219719fa6714e8b71f8a3e65e735e8505e8ebd7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Split/Variantdef16b62b48013165006ef4bb219719fa6714e8b71f8a3e65e735e8505e8ebd7.lean#L67).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6c780ac9575d5245f41bed13852b225a0efc89d3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
