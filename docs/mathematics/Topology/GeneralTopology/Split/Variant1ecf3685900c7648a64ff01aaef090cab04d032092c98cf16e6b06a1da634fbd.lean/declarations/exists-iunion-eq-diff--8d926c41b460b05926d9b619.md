## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ff47a98c-dc09-4e85-830a-2c1186a9506e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 352–360.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_iUnion_eq_diff (π : Prepartition I) :
    ∃ π' : Prepartition I, π'.iUnion = ↑I \ π.iUnion := by
  rcases π.eventually_splitMany_inf_eq_filter.exists with ⟨s, hs⟩
  use (splitMany I s).filter fun J => ¬(J : Set (ι → ℝ)) ⊆ π.iUnion
  simp [← hs]
#align box_integral.prepartition.exists_Union_eq_diff BoxIntegral.Prepartition.exists_iUnion_eq_diff

/-- If `π` is a prepartition of `I`, then `π.compl` is a prepartition of `I`
such that `π.compl.iUnion = I \ π.iUnion`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Split/Variant1ecf3685900c7648a64ff01aaef090cab04d032092c98cf16e6b06a1da634fbd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Split/Variant1ecf3685900c7648a64ff01aaef090cab04d032092c98cf16e6b06a1da634fbd.lean#L352).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `eb538b796d39d195a00650b3ca3fffc6e05bf965` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
