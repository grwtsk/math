## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4a9446be-25b9-349f-cc07-cecf33360a03`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 340–356.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma hasSum_mahler (f : C(ℤ_[p], E)) : HasSum (fun n ↦ mahlerTerm (Δ_[1]^[n] f 0) n) f := by
  -- First show `∑' n, mahlerTerm f n` converges to *something*.
  have : HasSum (fun n ↦ mahlerTerm (Δ_[1]^[n] f 0) n)
      (mahlerSeries (Δ_[1]^[·] f 0) : C(ℤ_[p], E)) :=
    hasSum_mahlerSeries (fwdDiff_tendsto_zero f)
  -- Now show that the sum of the Mahler terms must equal `f` on a dense set, so it is actually `f`.

The isometric equivalence from `C(ℤ_[p], E)` to the space of sequences in `E` tending to `0` given
by Mahler's theorem, for `E` a nonarchimedean `ℚ_[p]`-Banach space.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/MahlerBasis/Variant6bf23fc830ba2caee18e70272cf510c672d92e39b0d0559d97e9ca5ad38b5b54.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/MahlerBasis/Variant6bf23fc830ba2caee18e70272cf510c672d92e39b0d0559d97e9ca5ad38b5b54.lean#L340).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `931ff2159c5075009d8814d107a0a0bc1cdd0198` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
