## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f0ff2a5d-5657-733a-0842-5c4e10e07715`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 302–313.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma mahlerSeries_apply_nat (ha : Tendsto a atTop (𝓝 0)) {m n : ℕ} (hmn : m ≤ n) :
    mahlerSeries a (m : ℤ_[p]) = ∑ i ∈ range (n + 1), m.choose i • a i := by
  have h_van (i) : m.choose (i + (n + 1)) = 0 := Nat.choose_eq_zero_of_lt (by omega)
  have aux : Summable fun i ↦ m.choose (i + (n + 1)) • a (i + (n + 1)) := by
    simpa only [h_van, zero_smul] using summable_zero
  simp only [mahlerSeries_apply ha, mahler_natCast_eq, Nat.cast_smul_eq_nsmul, add_zero,
    ← aux.sum_add_tsum_nat_add' (f := fun i ↦ m.choose i • a i), h_van, zero_smul, tsum_zero]

/--
The coefficients of a Mahler series can be recovered from the sum by taking forward differences at
`0`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/MahlerBasis/Variant6bf23fc830ba2caee18e70272cf510c672d92e39b0d0559d97e9ca5ad38b5b54.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/MahlerBasis/Variant6bf23fc830ba2caee18e70272cf510c672d92e39b0d0559d97e9ca5ad38b5b54.lean#L302).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `931ff2159c5075009d8814d107a0a0bc1cdd0198` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
