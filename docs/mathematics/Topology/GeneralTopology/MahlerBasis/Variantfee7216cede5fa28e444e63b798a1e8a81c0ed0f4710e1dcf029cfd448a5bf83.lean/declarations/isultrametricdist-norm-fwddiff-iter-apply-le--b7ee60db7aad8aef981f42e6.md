## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:842f660b-f59e-4e7c-3ff6-0c9db376cfc2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 119–130.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  -- A proof by induction on `n` would be possible but would involve some messing around to
  -- define `Δ_[h]` as an operator on continuous maps (not just on bare functions). So instead we
  -- use the formula for `Δ_[h]^[n] f` as a sum.

/-- First step in Bojanić's proof of Mahler's theorem (equation (10) of [bojanic74]): rewrite
`Δ^[n + R] f 0` in a shape that makes it easy to bound `p`-adically. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/MahlerBasis/Variantfee7216cede5fa28e444e63b798a1e8a81c0ed0f4710e1dcf029cfd448a5bf83.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/MahlerBasis/Variantfee7216cede5fa28e444e63b798a1e8a81c0ed0f4710e1dcf029cfd448a5bf83.lean#L119).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c1eea98c66d3488a3dce3b861ea4e06b85fdf325` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
