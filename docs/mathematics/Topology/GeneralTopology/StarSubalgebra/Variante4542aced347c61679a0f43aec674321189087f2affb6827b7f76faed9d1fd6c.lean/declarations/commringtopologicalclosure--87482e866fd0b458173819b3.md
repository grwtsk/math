## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2210da2cf4f9560c593b0734475715d83b4ec8ec06447d9a5b2a635ecb82143a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 152–159.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def commRingTopologicalClosure {R A} [CommRing R] [StarRing R] [TopologicalSpace A] [Ring A]
    [Algebra R A] [StarRing A] [StarModule R A] [TopologicalRing A] [ContinuousStar A] [T2Space A]
    (s : StarSubalgebra R A) (hs : ∀ x y : s, x * y = y * x) : CommRing s.topologicalClosure :=
  s.toSubalgebra.commRingTopologicalClosure hs
#align star_subalgebra.comm_ring_topological_closure StarSubalgebra.commRingTopologicalClosure

/-- Continuous `StarAlgHom`s from the topological closure of a `StarSubalgebra` whose
compositions with the `StarSubalgebra.inclusion` map agree are, in fact, equal. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/StarSubalgebra/Variante4542aced347c61679a0f43aec674321189087f2affb6827b7f76faed9d1fd6c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/StarSubalgebra/Variante4542aced347c61679a0f43aec674321189087f2affb6827b7f76faed9d1fd6c.lean#L152).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `01da1e1fb14c6505e720ec37a7366399896cc2be` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
