## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a7f25036-6c64-1655-49d4-ed2ebbf50546`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 183–202.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem spatialDerivativeState_continuousAt {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) :
    ContinuousAt spatialDerivativeState A := by
  have hc := (spatialDerivative_differenceIntegral_continuousOn hA).continuousAt
    (Ioo_mem_nhds (by linarith : A / 2 < A) (by linarith : A < 2 * A))
  have ht : Tendsto (fun B : ℝ =>
      ∫ x : ℝ, (spatialDerivative B x - spatialDerivative A x) ^ 2) (nhds A) (nhds 0) := by

  have heq : (fun B : ℝ => ‖spatialDerivativeState B - spatialDerivativeState A‖ ^ 2) =ᶠ[nhds A]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/MixedSourceV1Prebytes/Variant4056ad4ca46f17abe99281766d1a73643fa2cfc29a134c2a8da18480688b903b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/MixedSourceV1Prebytes/Variant4056ad4ca46f17abe99281766d1a73643fa2cfc29a134c2a8da18480688b903b.lean#L183).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c892bdbbe1cff2f9a8b08a27904fe38bbf2ddcd8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
