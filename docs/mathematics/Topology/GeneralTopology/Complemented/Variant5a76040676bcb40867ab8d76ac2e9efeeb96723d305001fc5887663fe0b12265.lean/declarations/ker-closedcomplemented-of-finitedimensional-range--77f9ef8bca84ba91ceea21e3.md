## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a6c6ddf4-f09f-c036-5538-12ddc5e4031f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 45–58.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ker_closedComplemented_of_finiteDimensional_range (f : E →L[𝕜] F)
    [FiniteDimensional 𝕜 (range f)] : (ker f).ClosedComplemented := by
  set f' : E →L[𝕜] range f := f.codRestrict _ (LinearMap.mem_range_self (f : E →ₗ[𝕜] F))
  rcases f'.exists_right_inverse_of_surjective (f : E →ₗ[𝕜] F).range_rangeRestrict with ⟨g, hg⟩
  simpa only [f', ker_codRestrict]
    using f'.closedComplemented_ker_of_rightInverse g (ContinuousLinearMap.ext_iff.1 hg)

end

variable [CompleteSpace E] [CompleteSpace (F × G)]

/-- If `f : E →L[R] F` and `g : E →L[R] G` are two surjective linear maps and
their kernels are complement of each other, then `x ↦ (f x, g x)` defines
a linear equivalence `E ≃L[R] F × G`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Complemented/Variant5a76040676bcb40867ab8d76ac2e9efeeb96723d305001fc5887663fe0b12265.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Complemented/Variant5a76040676bcb40867ab8d76ac2e9efeeb96723d305001fc5887663fe0b12265.lean#L45).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `308622994a2ef674d3eac82ad404878aefa969da` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
