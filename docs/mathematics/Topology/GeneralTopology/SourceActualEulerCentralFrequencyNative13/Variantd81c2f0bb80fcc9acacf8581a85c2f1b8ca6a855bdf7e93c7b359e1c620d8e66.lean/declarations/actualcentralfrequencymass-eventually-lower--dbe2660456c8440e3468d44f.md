## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:96a83850-0fd1-e20b-104d-e75ad64ed3d8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 495–510.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem actualCentralFrequencyMass_eventually_lower :
    ∀ᶠ A : ℝ in atTop, actualCentralFrequencyConstant * Real.exp (2 * A) / A ^ 10 ≤
      actualCentralFrequencyMass A := by
  filter_upwards [eventually_ge_atTop (1 : ℝ), real_mellin_eventually_lower] with A hA hm
  have hp : 0 < A := by linarith
  calc
    _ = (ArithmeticFunction.vonMangoldt 2 / (2 : ℝ) ^ (3 / 2 : ℝ)) /
      (200 * Real.pi * A) * (41472 * Real.exp (2 * A) / A ^ 9) := by
        unfold actualCentralFrequencyConstant
        field_simp
    _ ≤ (ArithmeticFunction.vonMangoldt 2 / (2 : ℝ) ^ (3 / 2 : ℝ)) /
      (200 * Real.pi * A) * (actualInitialPrimeMellin A (3 / 2)).re :=
        mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left hm (by positivity)
    _ ≤ _ := actualCentralFrequencyMass_lower hA

/-- Both complete complementary intervals retain their orientations and finite head endpoints. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualEulerCentralFrequencyNative13/Variantd81c2f0bb80fcc9acacf8581a85c2f1b8ca6a855bdf7e93c7b359e1c620d8e66.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualEulerCentralFrequencyNative13/Variantd81c2f0bb80fcc9acacf8581a85c2f1b8ca6a855bdf7e93c7b359e1c620d8e66.lean#L495).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3034693cdd89f756228c803f7bea6cde7171f2aa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
