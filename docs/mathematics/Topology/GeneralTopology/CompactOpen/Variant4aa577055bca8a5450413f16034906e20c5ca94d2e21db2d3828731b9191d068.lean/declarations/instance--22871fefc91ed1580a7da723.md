## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d3b844a1c3bd3e5cae13976fa5bfd9dcc50922599a25b11cf880224172a3785a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 278–287.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [RegularSpace Y] : RegularSpace C(X, Y) :=
  .of_lift'_closure_le fun f ↦ by
    rw [← tendsto_id', tendsto_nhds_compactOpen]
    intro K hK U hU hf
    rcases (hK.image f.continuous).exists_isOpen_closure_subset (hU.mem_nhdsSet.2 hf.image_subset)
      with ⟨V, hVo, hKV, hVU⟩
    filter_upwards [mem_lift' (eventually_mapsTo hK hVo (mapsTo'.2 hKV))] with g hg
    refine ((isClosed_setOf_mapsTo isClosed_closure K).closure_subset ?_).mono_right hVU
    exact closure_mono (fun _ h ↦ h.mono_right subset_closure) hg

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactOpen/Variant4aa577055bca8a5450413f16034906e20c5ca94d2e21db2d3828731b9191d068.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactOpen/Variant4aa577055bca8a5450413f16034906e20c5ca94d2e21db2d3828731b9191d068.lean#L278).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1f271888146c4e06ac54f4198f1650cc82ab9edc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
