## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:504179eb-de45-0fdd-0837-f75d349fd66b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 444–462.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem continuous_const' : Continuous (const α : β → C(α, β)) :=
  const'.continuous
#align continuous_map.continuous_const' ContinuousMap.continuous_const'

end Curry

end CompactOpen

end ContinuousMap

open ContinuousMap

namespace Homeomorph

variable {α : Type*} {β : Type*} {γ : Type*}

variable [TopologicalSpace α] [TopologicalSpace β] [TopologicalSpace γ]

/-- Currying as a homeomorphism between the function spaces `C(α × β, γ)` and `C(α, C(β, γ))`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactOpen/Variant22296824c7a5166ed881a45b9ed96c829bad2da614fe6d0918460938285c5b9d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactOpen/Variant22296824c7a5166ed881a45b9ed96c829bad2da614fe6d0918460938285c5b9d.lean#L444).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4147406fcaf630234d7511a9db4a78a189f9b18e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
