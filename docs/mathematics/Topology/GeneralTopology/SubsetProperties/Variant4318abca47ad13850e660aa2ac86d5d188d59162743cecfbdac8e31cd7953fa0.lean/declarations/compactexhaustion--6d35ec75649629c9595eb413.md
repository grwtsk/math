## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:98e7d2f8d933fbe748105db2b8758e698c74f8df8e52bbb5a321fd993b33a6a3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1451–1464.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure CompactExhaustion (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] where
  /-- The sequence of compact sets that form a compact exhaustion. -/
  toFun : ℕ → Set X
  /-- The sets in the compact exhaustion are in fact compact. -/
  isCompact' : ∀ n, IsCompact (toFun n)
  /-- The sets in the compact exhaustion form a sequence:
    each set is contained in the interior of the next. -/
  subset_interior_succ' : ∀ n, toFun n ⊆ interior (toFun (n + 1))
  /-- The union of all sets in a compact exhaustion equals the entire space. -/
  iUnion_eq' : ⋃ n, toFun n = univ
#align compact_exhaustion CompactExhaustion

namespace CompactExhaustion

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SubsetProperties/Variant4318abca47ad13850e660aa2ac86d5d188d59162743cecfbdac8e31cd7953fa0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SubsetProperties/Variant4318abca47ad13850e660aa2ac86d5d188d59162743cecfbdac8e31cd7953fa0.lean#L1451).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f5e0367211eb19de17f150b351bf3e9f89559257` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
