## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:116b50af72746fafbdb8aa88bb49820fabede9b3315b5585e0893e31026cf293`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1402–1409.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected noncomputable def LocallyFinite.encodable {ι : Type*} {f : ι → Set α}
    (hf : LocallyFinite f) (hne : ∀ i, (f i).Nonempty) : Encodable ι :=
  @Encodable.ofEquiv _ _ (hf.countable_univ hne).toEncodable (Equiv.Set.univ _).symm
#align locally_finite.encodable LocallyFinite.encodable

/-- In a topological space with sigma compact topology, if `f` is a function that sends each point
`x` of a closed set `s` to a neighborhood of `x` within `s`, then for some countable set `t ⊆ s`,
the neighborhoods `f x`, `x ∈ t`, cover the whole set `s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SubsetProperties/Variant459985b727f8d7d7efbe4fef3992ca6a60c946cc9a9cf61e4f79b8ca80c17459.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SubsetProperties/Variant459985b727f8d7d7efbe4fef3992ca6a60c946cc9a9cf61e4f79b8ca80c17459.lean#L1402).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e52814ff071f39927c50c6b77ea81c348738f4dd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
