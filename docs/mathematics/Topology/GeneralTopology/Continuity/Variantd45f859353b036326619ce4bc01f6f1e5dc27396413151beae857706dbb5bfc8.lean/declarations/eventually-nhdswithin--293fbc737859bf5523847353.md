## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9da274e9-f7c5-da6a-b751-3913e1c60e3d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 114–123.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eventually_nhdsWithin' {x : X} (p : X → Prop) {s : Set X}
    (hx : x ∈ e.source) : (∀ᶠ y in 𝓝[e.symm ⁻¹' s] e x, p (e.symm y)) ↔ ∀ᶠ x in 𝓝[s] x, p x := by
  rw [e.eventually_nhdsWithin _ hx]
  refine eventually_congr <|
    (eventually_nhdsWithin_of_eventually_nhds <| e.eventually_left_inverse hx).mono fun y hy => ?_
  rw [hy]

/-- This lemma is useful in the manifold library in the case that `e` is a chart. It states that
  locally around `e x` the set `e.symm ⁻¹' s` is the same as the set intersected with the target
  of `e` and some other neighborhood of `f x` (which will be the source of a chart on `Z`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variantd45f859353b036326619ce4bc01f6f1e5dc27396413151beae857706dbb5bfc8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variantd45f859353b036326619ce4bc01f6f1e5dc27396413151beae857706dbb5bfc8.lean#L114).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `54b56e1b8b657b0417e16ed2e823b6f8aa757f03` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
