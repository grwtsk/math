## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b6e11867-691e-9617-2abb-60028206203a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 437–443.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem continuousOn_rpow_const_compl_zero {r : ℝ} :
    ContinuousOn (fun z : ℝ≥0 => z ^ r) {0}ᶜ :=
  fun _ h => ContinuousAt.continuousWithinAt <| NNReal.continuousAt_rpow_const (.inl h)

-- even though this follows from `ContinuousOn.mono` and the previous lemma, we include it for
-- automation purposes with `fun_prop`, because the side goal `0 ∉ s ∨ 0 ≤ r` is often easy to check
@[fun_prop]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variant1b21c6b1b598e19335a5976b1fe318107bb82e889f13b09b79f0e5d9ae79007f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variant1b21c6b1b598e19335a5976b1fe318107bb82e889f13b09b79f0e5d9ae79007f.lean#L437).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `23213b5dd4f6dd1d619013603550d890ded66861` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
