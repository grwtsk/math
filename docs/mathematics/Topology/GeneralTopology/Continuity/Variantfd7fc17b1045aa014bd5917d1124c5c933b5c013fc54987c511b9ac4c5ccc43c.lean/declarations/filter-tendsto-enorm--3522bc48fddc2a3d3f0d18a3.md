## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:698c5903-25cf-605f-e24f-5a018c1eb911`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 224–237.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Filter.Tendsto.enorm (h : Tendsto f l (𝓝 a)) : Tendsto (‖f ·‖ₑ) l (𝓝 ‖a‖ₑ) :=
  .comp continuous_enorm.continuousAt h

end ContinuousENorm

section SeminormedGroup

variable [SeminormedGroup E] [SeminormedGroup F] [SeminormedGroup G] {s : Set E} {a : E}

section

variable [TopologicalSpace α] {f : α → E} {s : Set α} {a : α}

@[to_additive (attr := fun_prop) ContinuousAt.norm]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variantfd7fc17b1045aa014bd5917d1124c5c933b5c013fc54987c511b9ac4c5ccc43c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variantfd7fc17b1045aa014bd5917d1124c5c933b5c013fc54987c511b9ac4c5ccc43c.lean#L224).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `94b75e46d2a4619f2b5894465f010e2f8f5dd755` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
