## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:df45b208-494d-3e46-ef32-28d780b45313`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 59–67.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem squeeze_one_norm' {f : α → E} {a : α → ℝ} {t₀ : Filter α} (h : ∀ᶠ n in t₀, ‖f n‖ ≤ a n)
    (h' : Tendsto a t₀ (𝓝 0)) : Tendsto f t₀ (𝓝 1) :=
  tendsto_one_iff_norm_tendsto_zero.2 <|
    squeeze_zero' (Eventually.of_forall fun _n => norm_nonneg' _) h h'

/-- Special case of the sandwich theorem: if the norm of `f` is bounded by a real function `a` which
tends to `0`, then `f` tends to `1`. -/

function `a` which tends to `0`, then `f` tends to `0`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variantdbbb22af660f09e361977e0bfea3d1bb9138544110c9eec08ed6df6e540d2fcf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variantdbbb22af660f09e361977e0bfea3d1bb9138544110c9eec08ed6df6e540d2fcf.lean#L59).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b89e19925330ba596658e5cf8bfae06e5cb03619` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
