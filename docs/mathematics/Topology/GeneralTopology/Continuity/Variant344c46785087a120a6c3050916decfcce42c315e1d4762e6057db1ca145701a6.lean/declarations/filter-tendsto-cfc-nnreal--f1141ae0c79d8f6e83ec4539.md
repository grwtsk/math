## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:881556ad-a68d-bfc5-33c3-1a1a6ad8a74c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 473–484.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Filter.Tendsto.cfc_nnreal {s : Set ℝ≥0} (hs : IsCompact s)
    (f : ℝ≥0 → ℝ≥0) {a : X → A} {a₀ : A} {l : Filter X} (ha_tendsto : Tendsto a l (𝓝 a₀))
    (ha : ∀ᶠ x in l, spectrum ℝ≥0 (a x) ⊆ s) (ha' : ∀ᶠ x in l, 0 ≤ a x)
    (ha₀ : spectrum ℝ≥0 a₀ ⊆ s) (ha₀' : 0 ≤ a₀) (hf : ContinuousOn f s := by cfc_cont_tac) :
    Tendsto (fun x ↦ cfc f (a x)) l (𝓝 (cfc f a₀)) := by
  apply continuousOn_cfc_nnreal A hs f |>.continuousWithinAt ⟨ha₀', ha₀⟩ |>.tendsto.comp
  rw [tendsto_nhdsWithin_iff]
  exact ⟨ha_tendsto, ha'.and ha⟩

/-- If `f : ℝ≥0 → ℝ≥0` is continuous on a compact set `s` and `a : X → A` is continuous at `x₀`, and
eventually `0 ≤ a x` and has spectrum contained in `s`, then `fun x ↦ cfc f (a x)` is continuous
at `x₀`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variant344c46785087a120a6c3050916decfcce42c315e1d4762e6057db1ca145701a6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variant344c46785087a120a6c3050916decfcce42c315e1d4762e6057db1ca145701a6.lean#L473).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7f65e7384596d418738f6bc1f56a23ad60c5657a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
