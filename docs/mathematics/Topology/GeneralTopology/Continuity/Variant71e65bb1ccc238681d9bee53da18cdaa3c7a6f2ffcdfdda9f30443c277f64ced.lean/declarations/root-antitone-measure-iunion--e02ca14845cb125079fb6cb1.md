## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f5bc76dd-4ef8-62e2-4363-5728233214b9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 81–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem _root_.Antitone.measure_iUnion [Preorder ι] [IsCodirectedOrder ι]
    [(atBot : Filter ι).IsCountablyGenerated] (hs : Antitone s) :
    μ (⋃ i, s i) = ⨆ i, μ (s i) :=
  hs.dual_left.measure_iUnion

/-- Continuity from below: the measure of the union of a sequence of
(not necessarily measurable) sets is the supremum of the measures of the partial unions. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variant71e65bb1ccc238681d9bee53da18cdaa3c7a6f2ffcdfdda9f30443c277f64ced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variant71e65bb1ccc238681d9bee53da18cdaa3c7a6f2ffcdfdda9f30443c277f64ced.lean#L81).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `be390e716cdc71c2e888e6c47fa50e7cbc0e0ca1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
