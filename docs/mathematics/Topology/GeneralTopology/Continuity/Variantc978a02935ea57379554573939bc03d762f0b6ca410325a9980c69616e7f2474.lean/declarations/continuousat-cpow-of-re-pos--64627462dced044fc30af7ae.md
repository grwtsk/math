## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ad98ab74-90d6-fef9-d583-a8ab47ad1835`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 376–386.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem continuousAt_cpow_of_re_pos {p : ℂ × ℂ} (h₁ : 0 ≤ p.1.re ∨ p.1.im ≠ 0) (h₂ : 0 < p.2.re) :

  cases' p with z w
  rw [← not_lt_zero_iff, lt_iff_le_and_ne, not_and_or, Ne.def, Classical.not_not,
    not_le_zero_iff] at h₁
  rcases h₁ with (h₁ | (rfl : z = 0))
  exacts [continuousAt_cpow h₁, continuousAt_cpow_zero_of_re_pos h₂]
#align complex.continuous_at_cpow_of_re_pos Complex.continuousAt_cpow_of_re_pos

/-- See also `continuousAt_cpow_const` for a version that assumes `z ≠ 0` but makes no
assumptions about `w`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variantc978a02935ea57379554573939bc03d762f0b6ca410325a9980c69616e7f2474.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variantc978a02935ea57379554573939bc03d762f0b6ca410325a9980c69616e7f2474.lean#L376).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d84da246704873bac04e2cb536cc0cd81ee3b9bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
