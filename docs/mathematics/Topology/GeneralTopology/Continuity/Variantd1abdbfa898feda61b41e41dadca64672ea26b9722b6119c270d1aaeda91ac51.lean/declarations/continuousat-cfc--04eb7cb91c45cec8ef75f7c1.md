## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0ffc5772-2cf9-c60a-ebf5-a3c3031753c7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 293–302.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem ContinuousAt.cfc [TopologicalSpace X] {s : Set 𝕜} (hs : IsCompact s) (f : 𝕜 → 𝕜)
    {a : X → A} {x₀ : X} (ha_cont : ContinuousAt a x₀)
    (ha : ∀ᶠ x in 𝓝 x₀, spectrum 𝕜 (a x) ⊆ s) (ha' : ∀ᶠ x in 𝓝 x₀, p (a x))
    (hf : ContinuousOn f s := by cfc_cont_tac) :
    ContinuousAt (fun x ↦ cfc f (a x)) x₀ :=
  ha_cont.tendsto.cfc hs f ha ha' ha.self_of_nhds ha'.self_of_nhds

/-- If `f : 𝕜 → 𝕜` is continuous on a compact set `s` and `a : X → A` is continuous at `x₀` within
a set `t : Set X`, and eventually `a x` satisfies the predicate `p` associated to `𝕜` and has
spectrum contained in `s`, then `fun x ↦ cfc f (a x)` is continuous at `x₀` within `t`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variantd1abdbfa898feda61b41e41dadca64672ea26b9722b6119c270d1aaeda91ac51.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variantd1abdbfa898feda61b41e41dadca64672ea26b9722b6119c270d1aaeda91ac51.lean#L293).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `44cd53bc76622f44aed7e388806ac3e32f701e37` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
