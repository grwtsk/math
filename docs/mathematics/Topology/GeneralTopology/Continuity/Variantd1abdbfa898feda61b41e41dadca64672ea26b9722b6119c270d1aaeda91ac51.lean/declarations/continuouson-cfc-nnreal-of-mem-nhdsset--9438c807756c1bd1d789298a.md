## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:08375149-71d8-4ca3-7e24-474db014fd2d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1082–1106.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Suppose `a : X → Set A` is a continuous family of nonnegative elements.
Suppose further that `s : X → Set ℝ≥0` is a family of compact sets such that `s x₀` contains the
spectrum of `a x` for all sufficiently close `x`. If `f : ℝ≥0 → ℝ≥0` is continuous on each `s x`
and `f 0 = 0`, then `fun x ↦ cfc f (a x)` is continuous. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variantd1abdbfa898feda61b41e41dadca64672ea26b9722b6119c270d1aaeda91ac51.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuity/Variantd1abdbfa898feda61b41e41dadca64672ea26b9722b6119c270d1aaeda91ac51.lean#L1082).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `44cd53bc76622f44aed7e388806ac3e32f701e37` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
