## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1a9bcc6d62c3bb87ece1dcb3ed1faa09f39b0076228787658ba4c3dc6e181daa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 47–57.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {a : ℝ} : DiscreteTopology (AddSubgroup.zmultiples a) := by
  rcases eq_or_ne a 0 with (rfl | ha)
  · rw [AddSubgroup.zmultiples_zero_eq_bot]
    exact Subsingleton.discreteTopology (α := (⊥ : Submodule ℤ ℝ))
  rw [discreteTopology_iff_isOpen_singleton_zero, isOpen_induced_iff]
  refine ⟨ball 0 |a|, isOpen_ball, ?_⟩
  ext ⟨x, hx⟩
  obtain ⟨k, rfl⟩ := AddSubgroup.mem_zmultiples_iff.mp hx
  simp [ha, Real.dist_eq, abs_mul, (by norm_cast : |(k : ℝ)| < 1 ↔ |k| < 1)]

/-- Under the coercion from `ℤ` to `ℝ`, inverse images of compact sets are finite. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ZMultiples/Variant10a3cec4a1689d9eb2e30b11e1bf34c33fb7c4330824e95b2b41c233b8368779.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ZMultiples/Variant10a3cec4a1689d9eb2e30b11e1bf34c33fb7c4330824e95b2b41c233b8368779.lean#L47).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `808397606770f458f9a4de051fd3fe022b219109` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
