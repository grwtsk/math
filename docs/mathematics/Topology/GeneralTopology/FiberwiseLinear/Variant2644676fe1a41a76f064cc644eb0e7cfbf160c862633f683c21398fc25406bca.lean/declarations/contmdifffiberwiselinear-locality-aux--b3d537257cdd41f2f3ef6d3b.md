## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6e41d79f-ab61-62ae-17bd-f0d01871a731`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 111–165.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Let `e` be a partial homeomorphism of `B × F` whose source is `U ×ˢ univ`, for some set `U` in
`B`, and which, at any point `x` in `U`, admits a neighbourhood `u` of `x` such that `e` is equal
on `u ×ˢ univ` to some bi-`C^n` fiberwise linear partial homeomorphism.  Then `e` itself
is equal to some bi-`C^n` fiberwise linear partial homeomorphism.

This is the key mathematical point of the `locality` condition in the construction of the
`StructureGroupoid` of bi-`C^n` fiberwise linear partial homeomorphisms.  The proof is by gluing
together the various bi-`C^n` fiberwise linear partial homeomorphism which exist locally.

The `U` in the conclusion is the same `U` as in the hypothesis. We state it like this, because this
is exactly what we need for `contMDiffFiberwiseLinear`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/FiberwiseLinear/Variant2644676fe1a41a76f064cc644eb0e7cfbf160c862633f683c21398fc25406bca.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/FiberwiseLinear/Variant2644676fe1a41a76f064cc644eb0e7cfbf160c862633f683c21398fc25406bca.lean#L111).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
