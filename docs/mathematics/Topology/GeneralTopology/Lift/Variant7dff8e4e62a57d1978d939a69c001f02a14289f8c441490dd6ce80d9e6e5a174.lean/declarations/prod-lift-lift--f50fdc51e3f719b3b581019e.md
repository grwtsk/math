## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7242feb3-0122-b785-d5f8-b3023990e81b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 368–376.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem prod_lift_lift {f₁ : Filter α₁} {f₂ : Filter α₂} {g₁ : Set α₁ → Filter β₁}
    {g₂ : Set α₂ → Filter β₂} (hg₁ : Monotone g₁) (hg₂ : Monotone g₂) :
    f₁.lift g₁ ×ˢ f₂.lift g₂ = f₁.lift fun s => f₂.lift fun t => g₁ s ×ˢ g₂ t := by
  simp only [prod_def, lift_assoc hg₁]
  apply congr_arg; funext x
  rw [lift_comm]
  apply congr_arg; funext y
  apply lift'_lift_assoc hg₂

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lift/Variant7dff8e4e62a57d1978d939a69c001f02a14289f8c441490dd6ce80d9e6e5a174.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lift/Variant7dff8e4e62a57d1978d939a69c001f02a14289f8c441490dd6ce80d9e6e5a174.lean#L368).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `51d949e57518cdff4e244707dfa6a7fd5f3135f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
