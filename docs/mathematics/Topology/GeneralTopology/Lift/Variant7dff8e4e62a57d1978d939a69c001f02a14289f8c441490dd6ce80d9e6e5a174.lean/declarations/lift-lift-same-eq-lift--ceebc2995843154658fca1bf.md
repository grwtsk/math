## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5c146739-be55-161b-98bb-726ee20f1bb9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 304–309.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lift_lift'_same_eq_lift' {g : Set α → Set α → Set β} (hg₁ : ∀ s, Monotone fun t => g s t)
    (hg₂ : ∀ t, Monotone fun s => g s t) :
    (f.lift fun s => f.lift' (g s)) = f.lift' fun s => g s s :=
  lift_lift_same_eq_lift (fun s => monotone_principal.comp (hg₁ s)) fun t =>
    monotone_principal.comp (hg₂ t)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lift/Variant7dff8e4e62a57d1978d939a69c001f02a14289f8c441490dd6ce80d9e6e5a174.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lift/Variant7dff8e4e62a57d1978d939a69c001f02a14289f8c441490dd6ce80d9e6e5a174.lean#L304).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `51d949e57518cdff4e244707dfa6a7fd5f3135f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
