## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d1652d8b-768d-47c3-fa4a-c76646a3107d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 999–1009.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsPathConnected.union {U V : Set X} (hU : IsPathConnected U) (hV : IsPathConnected V)
    (hUV : (U ∩ V).Nonempty) : IsPathConnected (U ∪ V) := by
  rcases hUV with ⟨x, xU, xV⟩
  use x, Or.inl xU
  rintro y (yU | yV)
  · exact (hU.joinedIn x xU y yU).mono (subset_union_left U V)
  · exact (hV.joinedIn x xV y yV).mono (subset_union_right U V)
#align is_path_connected.union IsPathConnected.union

/-- If a set `W` is path-connected, then it is also path-connected when seen as a set in a smaller
ambient type `U` (when `U` contains `W`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/PathConnected/Variant7b8cbe19c4b6fc640e191b78738535375a43455893af76c2b5240e6dbbe23f64.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PathConnected/Variant7b8cbe19c4b6fc640e191b78738535375a43455893af76c2b5240e6dbbe23f64.lean#L999).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cdc88775fd9bd3124ee2c1c112e2aea03f8071c7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
