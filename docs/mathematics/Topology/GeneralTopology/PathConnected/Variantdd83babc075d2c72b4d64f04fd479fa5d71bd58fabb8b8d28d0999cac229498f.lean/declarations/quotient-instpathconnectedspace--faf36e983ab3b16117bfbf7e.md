## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3fd82ad9c78b91758f033397a9f3aa8573da999bf42a335568db663bd38cd372`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1155–1160.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Quotient.instPathConnectedSpace {s : Setoid X} [PathConnectedSpace X] :
    PathConnectedSpace (Quotient s) :=
  (surjective_quotient_mk X).pathConnectedSpace continuous_coinduced_rng

/-- This is a special case of `NormedSpace.path_connected` (and
`TopologicalAddGroup.pathConnectedSpace`). It exists only to simplify dependencies. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/PathConnected/Variantdd83babc075d2c72b4d64f04fd479fa5d71bd58fabb8b8d28d0999cac229498f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PathConnected/Variantdd83babc075d2c72b4d64f04fd479fa5d71bd58fabb8b8d28d0999cac229498f.lean#L1155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f79ff3e521956a45c84342dd1cf5b96187dc336a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
