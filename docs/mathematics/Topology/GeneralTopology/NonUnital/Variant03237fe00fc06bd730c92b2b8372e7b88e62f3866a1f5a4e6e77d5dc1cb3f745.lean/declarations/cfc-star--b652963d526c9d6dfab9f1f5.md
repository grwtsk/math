## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0fc09023-8a70-65e8-da29-02a616a8e29c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 444–456.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma cfcₙ_star : cfcₙ (fun x ↦ star (f x)) a = star (cfcₙ f a) := by
  by_cases h : p a ∧ ContinuousOn f (σₙ R a) ∧ f 0 = 0
  · obtain ⟨ha, hf, h0⟩ := h
    rw [cfcₙ_apply f a, ← map_star, cfcₙ_apply _ a]
    congr
  · simp only [not_and_or] at h
    obtain (ha | hf | h0) := h
    · simp [cfcₙ_apply_of_not_predicate a ha]
    · rw [cfcₙ_apply_of_not_continuousOn a hf, cfcₙ_apply_of_not_continuousOn, star_zero]
      exact fun hf_star ↦ hf <| by simpa using hf_star.star
    · rw [cfcₙ_apply_of_not_map_zero a h0, cfcₙ_apply_of_not_map_zero, star_zero]
      exact fun hf0 ↦ h0 <| by simpa using congr(star $(hf0))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/NonUnital/Variant03237fe00fc06bd730c92b2b8372e7b88e62f3866a1f5a4e6e77d5dc1cb3f745.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/NonUnital/Variant03237fe00fc06bd730c92b2b8372e7b88e62f3866a1f5a4e6e77d5dc1cb3f745.lean#L444).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d5b8be2ff6a62665311738463360b43b972982a5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
