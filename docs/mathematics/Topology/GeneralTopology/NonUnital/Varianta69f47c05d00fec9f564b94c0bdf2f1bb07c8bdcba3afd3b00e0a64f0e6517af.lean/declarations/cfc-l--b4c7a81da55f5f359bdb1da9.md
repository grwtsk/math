## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:15b11c3995fe041f1f1c702766a51d70e9356be256cd56d807951a069d65e595`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 201–230.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

noncomputable def cfcₙL {a : A} (ha : p a) : C(σₙ R a, R)₀ →L[R] A :=
  { cfcₙHom ha with
    toFun := cfcₙHom ha
    map_smul' := map_smul _
    cont := (cfcₙHom_isClosedEmbedding ha).continuous }

end cfcₙL

/-- This is the *continuous functional calculus* of an element `a : A` in a non-unital algebra
applied to bare functions.  When either `a` does not satisfy the predicate `p` (i.e., `a` is not
`IsStarNormal`, `IsSelfAdjoint`, or `0 ≤ a` when `R` is `ℂ`, `ℝ`, or `ℝ≥0`, respectively), or when
`f : R → R` is not continuous on the quasispectrum of `a` or `f 0 ≠ 0`, then `cfcₙ f a` returns the
junk value `0`.

This is the primary declaration intended for widespread use of the continuous functional calculus
for non-unital algebras, and all the API applies to this declaration. For more information, see the
module documentation for `Analysis.CStarAlgebra.ContinuousFunctionalCalculus.Unital`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/NonUnital/Varianta69f47c05d00fec9f564b94c0bdf2f1bb07c8bdcba3afd3b00e0a64f0e6517af.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/NonUnital/Varianta69f47c05d00fec9f564b94c0bdf2f1bb07c8bdcba3afd3b00e0a64f0e6517af.lean#L201).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ecbfcb91b48ba7065b11578de5927f78b4e8ba41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
