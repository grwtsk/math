## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:98725900-e900-3f17-161e-caa82ad98ef6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 46–71.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (ht0 : 0 ≤ t) (ht : t ≤ 2 * A) :

      deriv (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A) t / 2| ≤
        actualCriticalNinthEdgePolynomial (2 * A - t) / A ^ 9 := by
  have h1 : 1 ≤ A := by linarith
  have hz : 0 ≤ 2 * A - t := by linarith
  have hzA : 2 * A - t ≤ 2 * A := by linarith
  have h0 := sourceCorrelation_upper_edge_abs_le A (2 * A - t) h1 hz hzA
  have hd := actual_correlation_deriv_upper_edge_abs_le A (2 * A - t) h1 hz hzA

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualCriticalCovarianceEdgeNine/Variant5f5a1ee578bcd53c5ca51339316afbac962b3ea4080acd784b47c59cbf03f316.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualCriticalCovarianceEdgeNine/Variant5f5a1ee578bcd53c5ca51339316afbac962b3ea4080acd784b47c59cbf03f316.lean#L46).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `655e4f2ceb04bf5f444bffd0271cb60e1e82c45f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
