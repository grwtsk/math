## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5c68782d-2269-df64-2543-34a56cd30e24`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 487–505.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean

    (h₁ : l₁.Nodup) (hsub : l₁ ⊆ l₂) : l₁.length ≤ l₂.length := by

  | cons a t ih =>

    have htsub : t ⊆ l₂.erase a := by
      intro x hx
      have hxa : x ≠ a := fun h => h₁.1 (h ▸ hx)
      exact (mem_erase_of_ne hxa).2 (hsub (mem_cons_of_mem _ hx))
    have hih := ih h₁.2 htsub
    have hlen : (l₂.erase a).length = l₂.length - 1 := by rw [length_erase]; simp [ha]
    have hpos : 1 ≤ l₂.length := length_pos_of_mem ha
    calc t.length + 1 ≤ (l₂.erase a).length + 1 := Nat.succ_le_succ hih
      _ = (l₂.length - 1) + 1 := by rw [hlen]
      _ = l₂.length := Nat.sub_add_cancel hpos

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Perm/Variantc778ecb634cad13616e994adb18f7028a0ea3c229e747a0fee02e033108a8d39.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Perm/Variantc778ecb634cad13616e994adb18f7028a0ea3c229e747a0fee02e033108a8d39.lean#L487).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `59a94253076fafc6c6e005cadd7171fcd02631a6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
