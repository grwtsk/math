## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9575f77e93195b833c748cb5b49dd9fcaaa574b9499a4b70775a0ef0c214e7ff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–99.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def RestrictGermPredicate (P : ∀ x : X, Germ (𝓝 x) Y → Prop)
    (A : Set X) : ∀ x : X, Germ (𝓝 x) Y → Prop := fun x φ ↦
  Germ.liftOn φ (fun f ↦ x ∈ A → ∀ᶠ y in 𝓝 x, P y f)
    haveI : ∀ f f' : X → Y, f =ᶠ[𝓝 x] f' → (∀ᶠ y in 𝓝 x, P y f) → ∀ᶠ y in 𝓝 x, P y f' := by
      intro f f' hff' hf
      apply (hf.and <| Eventually.eventually_nhds hff').mono
      rintro y ⟨hy, hy'⟩
      rwa [Germ.coe_eq.mpr (EventuallyEq.symm hy')]
    fun f f' hff' ↦ propext <| forall_congr' fun _ ↦ ⟨this f f' hff', this f' f hff'.symm⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Germ/Variantcfa3600f4acb082f39841ec5726b530e0001876ee094466b7fa35a87fbf2d1eb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Germ/Variantcfa3600f4acb082f39841ec5726b530e0001876ee094466b7fa35a87fbf2d1eb.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0c1007cf008628ae41b8d1987294581706770271` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
