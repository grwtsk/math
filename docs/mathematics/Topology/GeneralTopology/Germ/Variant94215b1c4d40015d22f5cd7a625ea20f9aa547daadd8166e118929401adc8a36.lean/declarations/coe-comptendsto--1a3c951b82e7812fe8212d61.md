## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c52a6b64-8ee4-fa15-9200-43a617029cb8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 246–252.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coe_compTendsto' (f : α → β) {lc : Filter γ} {g : Germ lc α} (hg : g.Tendsto l) :
    (f : Germ l β).compTendsto' g hg = g.map f :=
  rfl
#align filter.germ.coe_comp_tendsto' Filter.Germ.coe_compTendsto'

/-- Given a germ `f : Germ l β` and a function `g : γ → α`, where `l : Filter α`, if `g` tends
to `l` along `lc : Filter γ`, then the composition `f ∘ g` is well-defined as a germ at `lc`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Germ/Variant94215b1c4d40015d22f5cd7a625ea20f9aa547daadd8166e118929401adc8a36.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Germ/Variant94215b1c4d40015d22f5cd7a625ea20f9aa547daadd8166e118929401adc8a36.lean#L246).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `07b4de759cb1ba0c93743d20f5b151df621dd406` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
