## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0cef191a0d422b9df57fcea7b6e3b587d0ac821fcc1ec09dfa330fdfbee0142d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 837–843.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance orderedCancelCommMonoid [OrderedCancelCommMonoid β]  :
    OrderedCancelCommMonoid (Germ l β) :=
  { Germ.orderedCommMonoid with
    le_of_mul_le_mul_left := fun f g h =>
      inductionOn₃ f g h fun _f _g _h H => H.mono fun _x => le_of_mul_le_mul_left' }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Germ/Variant94215b1c4d40015d22f5cd7a625ea20f9aa547daadd8166e118929401adc8a36.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Germ/Variant94215b1c4d40015d22f5cd7a625ea20f9aa547daadd8166e118929401adc8a36.lean#L837).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `07b4de759cb1ba0c93743d20f5b151df621dd406` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
