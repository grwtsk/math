## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b39a5f69f67d3300f56150e1be6d9f5108066b0b9e8ea00c65200b868da8cd91`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 343–356.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance canLiftContinuousLinearMap : CanLift (E →ₗ[𝕜] F) (E →L[𝕜] F) (↑) fun _ => True :=
  ⟨fun f _ => ⟨LinearMap.toContinuousLinearMap f, rfl⟩⟩
#align linear_map.can_lift_continuous_linear_map LinearMap.canLiftContinuousLinearMap

end LinearMap

section

variable [T2Space E] [T2Space F] [FiniteDimensional 𝕜 E]

namespace LinearEquiv

/-- The continuous linear equivalence induced by a linear equivalence on a finite dimensional
space. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/FiniteDimension/Variant9d645a94ef00254b798464c35eb3b7fddcbcf4a8996511dd8c4d8f989656e1e1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/FiniteDimension/Variant9d645a94ef00254b798464c35eb3b7fddcbcf4a8996511dd8c4d8f989656e1e1.lean#L343).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2be48f91fcc6b0932c9b3bb4810f8851c7b492d5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
