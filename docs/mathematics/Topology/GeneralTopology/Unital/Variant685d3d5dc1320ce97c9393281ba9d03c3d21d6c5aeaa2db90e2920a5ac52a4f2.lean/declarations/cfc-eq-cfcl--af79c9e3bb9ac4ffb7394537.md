## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:deaa46f8-7f40-08de-9aae-a5062193462d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 355–360.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma cfc_eq_cfcL {a : A} {f : R → R} (ha : p a) (hf : ContinuousOn f (spectrum R a)) :
    cfc f a = cfcL ha ⟨_, hf.domRestrict⟩ := by
  rw [cfc_def, dite_eq_left ⟨ha, hf⟩, cfcL_apply]

set_option backward.privateInPublic true in
/-- A version of `cfc_apply` in terms of `ContinuousMap.mkD` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Unital/Variant685d3d5dc1320ce97c9393281ba9d03c3d21d6c5aeaa2db90e2920a5ac52a4f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Unital/Variant685d3d5dc1320ce97c9393281ba9d03c3d21d6c5aeaa2db90e2920a5ac52a4f2.lean#L355).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `80944cc700ffac05f1890454cca4432c1bc98d6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
