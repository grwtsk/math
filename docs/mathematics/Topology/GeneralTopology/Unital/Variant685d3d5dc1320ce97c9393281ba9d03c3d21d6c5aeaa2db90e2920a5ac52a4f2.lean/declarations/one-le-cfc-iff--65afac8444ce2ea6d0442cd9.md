## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e213c4be-c853-0c85-424d-d9e8026e6ff4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1095–1099.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma one_le_cfc_iff (f : R → R) (a : A)
    (hf : ContinuousOn f (spectrum R a) := by cfc_cont_tac) (ha : p a := by cfc_tac) :
    1 ≤ cfc f a ↔ ∀ x ∈ spectrum R a, 1 ≤ f x := by
  simpa using algebraMap_le_cfc_iff f 1 a

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Unital/Variant685d3d5dc1320ce97c9393281ba9d03c3d21d6c5aeaa2db90e2920a5ac52a4f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Unital/Variant685d3d5dc1320ce97c9393281ba9d03c3d21d6c5aeaa2db90e2920a5ac52a4f2.lean#L1095).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `80944cc700ffac05f1890454cca4432c1bc98d6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
