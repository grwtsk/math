## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:589a7800ff8a97165936da81274e234572e9b882581c4606269385dba6aff987`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1149–1154.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class ClosedEmbeddingContinuousFunctionalCalculus (R A : Type*) (p : outParam (A → Prop))
    [CommSemiring R] [StarRing R] [MetricSpace R] [IsTopologicalSemiring R] [ContinuousStar R]
    [Ring A] [StarRing A] [TopologicalSpace A] [Algebra R A] extends
    ContinuousFunctionalCalculus R A p where
  isClosedEmbedding (a : A) (ha : p a) : Topology.IsClosedEmbedding (cfcHom (R := R) ha)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Unital/Variant685d3d5dc1320ce97c9393281ba9d03c3d21d6c5aeaa2db90e2920a5ac52a4f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Unital/Variant685d3d5dc1320ce97c9393281ba9d03c3d21d6c5aeaa2db90e2920a5ac52a4f2.lean#L1149).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `80944cc700ffac05f1890454cca4432c1bc98d6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
