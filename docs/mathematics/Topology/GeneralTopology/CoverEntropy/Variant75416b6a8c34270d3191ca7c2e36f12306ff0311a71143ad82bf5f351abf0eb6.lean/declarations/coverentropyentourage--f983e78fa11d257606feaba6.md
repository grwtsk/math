## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f966ea88d7fd0f604806af02dd948722621669cbeeba0f175717720dd98d5e55`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 361–366.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def coverEntropyEntourage (T : X → X) (F : Set X) (U : Set (X × X)) :=
  expGrowthSup fun n : ℕ ↦ coverMincard T F U n

/-- The entropy of an entourage `U`, defined as the exponential rate of growth of the size
  of the smallest `(U, n)`-refined cover of `F`. Takes values in the space of extended real numbers
  `[-∞, +∞]`. This second version uses a `liminf`, and is chosen as an alternative definition. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CoverEntropy/Variant75416b6a8c34270d3191ca7c2e36f12306ff0311a71143ad82bf5f351abf0eb6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CoverEntropy/Variant75416b6a8c34270d3191ca7c2e36f12306ff0311a71143ad82bf5f351abf0eb6.lean#L361).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `38015c8911940b320a2cbd89df153f30f342af42` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
