## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5574c8c6-9ef0-8ea4-cf69-61ccdb0f00e3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 191–199.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma exists_isDynCoverOf_of_isCompact_uniformContinuous [UniformSpace X]
    (F_comp : IsCompact F) (h : UniformContinuous T) (U_uni : U ∈ 𝓤 X) (n : ℕ) :
    ∃ s : Finset X, IsDynCoverOf T F U n s := by
  obtain ⟨(V : SetRel X X), hV, hVsymm, hVU⟩ := symm_of_uniformity U_uni
  have uni_ite := dynEntourage_mem_uniformity h hV n
  let openCover x := ball x (dynEntourage T V n)
  obtain ⟨s, _, s_cover⟩ := F_comp.elim_nhds_subcover openCover fun x _ ↦ ball_mem_nhds x uni_ite
  exact ⟨s, .of_entourage_subset hVU <| .of_subset_iUnion_ball s_cover⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CoverEntropy/Variantf5c8e6e4f0a465001d46c48465a72db4e92f93f5bc966cb848f73983a2001b46.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CoverEntropy/Variantf5c8e6e4f0a465001d46c48465a72db4e92f93f5bc966cb848f73983a2001b46.lean#L191).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f24095fc7ce6b73eccdfe13b56383ef1a997de95` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
