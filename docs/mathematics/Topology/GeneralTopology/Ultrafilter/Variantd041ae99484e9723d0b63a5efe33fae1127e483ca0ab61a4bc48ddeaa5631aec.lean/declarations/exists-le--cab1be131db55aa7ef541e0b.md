## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:37a1190f-6083-3d2b-b459-d443b85e4c16`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 377–387.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_le (f : Filter α) [h : NeBot f] : ∃ u : Ultrafilter α, ↑u ≤ f :=
  let ⟨u, hu, huf⟩ := (eq_bot_or_exists_atom_le f).resolve_left h.ne
  ⟨ofAtom u hu, huf⟩
#align ultrafilter.exists_le Ultrafilter.exists_le

alias _root_.Filter.exists_ultrafilter_le := exists_le
#align filter.exists_ultrafilter_le Filter.exists_ultrafilter_le

/-- Construct an ultrafilter extending a given filter.
  The ultrafilter lemma is the assertion that such a filter exists;
  we use the axiom of choice to pick one. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Ultrafilter/Variantd041ae99484e9723d0b63a5efe33fae1127e483ca0ab61a4bc48ddeaa5631aec.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Ultrafilter/Variantd041ae99484e9723d0b63a5efe33fae1127e483ca0ab61a4bc48ddeaa5631aec.lean#L377).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4a6e79830e0f3b6bfd9bc8ce25bf44f8d58c04c2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
