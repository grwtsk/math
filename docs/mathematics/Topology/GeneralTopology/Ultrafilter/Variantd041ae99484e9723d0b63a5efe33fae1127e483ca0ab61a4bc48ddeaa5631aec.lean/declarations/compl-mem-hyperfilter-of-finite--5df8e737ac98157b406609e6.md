## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b5f8c2e2-426f-ba29-128d-1e531b918f4f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 503–509.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem compl_mem_hyperfilter_of_finite {s : Set α} (hf : Set.Finite s) : sᶜ ∈ hyperfilter α :=
  compl_mem_iff_not_mem.2 hf.nmem_hyperfilter
#align filter.compl_mem_hyperfilter_of_finite Filter.compl_mem_hyperfilter_of_finite

alias _root_.Set.Finite.compl_mem_hyperfilter := compl_mem_hyperfilter_of_finite
#align set.finite.compl_mem_hyperfilter Set.Finite.compl_mem_hyperfilter

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Ultrafilter/Variantd041ae99484e9723d0b63a5efe33fae1127e483ca0ab61a4bc48ddeaa5631aec.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Ultrafilter/Variantd041ae99484e9723d0b63a5efe33fae1127e483ca0ab61a4bc48ddeaa5631aec.lean#L503).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4a6e79830e0f3b6bfd9bc8ce25bf44f8d58c04c2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
