## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5928c8d8-973d-b604-e06a-4f59dd25be23`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 68–76.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsLindelof.compl_mem_sets_of_nhdsWithin (hs : IsLindelof s) {f : Filter X}
    [CountableInterFilter f] (hf : ∀ x ∈ s, ∃ t ∈ 𝓝[s] x, tᶜ ∈ f) : sᶜ ∈ f := by
  refine hs.compl_mem_sets fun x hx ↦ ?_
  rw [← disjoint_principal_right, disjoint_right_comm, (basis_sets _).disjoint_iff_left]
  exact hf x hx

/-- If `p : Set X → Prop` is stable under restriction and union, and each point `x`
  of a Lindelöf set `s` has a neighborhood `t` within `s` such that `p t`, then `p s` holds. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lindelof/Variant7cad11a9c9b50270f4c185c8860f41c69eae05927e40502e082fdcd9a330b214.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lindelof/Variant7cad11a9c9b50270f4c185c8860f41c69eae05927e40502e082fdcd9a330b214.lean#L68).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `04e5d59fcc04eecb88714f3048cd71b043396086` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
