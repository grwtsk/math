## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9d965d49-282a-de42-8e8e-219a7291e505`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 588–596.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem countable_cover_nhds [LindelofSpace X] {U : X → Set X} (hU : ∀ x, U x ∈ 𝓝 x) :
    ∃ t : Set X, t.Countable ∧ ⋃ x ∈ t, U x = univ :=
  let ⟨t, ht⟩ := countable_cover_nhds_interior hU
  ⟨t, ⟨ht.1, univ_subset_iff.1 <| ht.2.symm.subset.trans <|
    iUnion₂_mono fun _ _ => interior_subset⟩⟩

/-- The comap of the coLindelöf filter on `Y` by a continuous function `f : X → Y` is less than or
equal to the coLindelöf filter on `X`.
This is a reformulation of the fact that images of Lindelöf sets are Lindelöf. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lindelof/Variant17057c966a3ca3137690d31c7cc0da5c3036aa0e44a94bf62325764f0e6ec25d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lindelof/Variant17057c966a3ca3137690d31c7cc0da5c3036aa0e44a94bf62325764f0e6ec25d.lean#L588).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a53449fe2a297dc7b1f2ce908b9e2693c30c1876` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
