## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:67cc7840-14a2-efaf-eccf-8fdc188aab6e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 625–631.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem addOrderOf_coe_rat {q : ℚ} : addOrderOf (↑(↑q * p) : AddCircle p) = q.den := by
  have : (↑(q.den : ℤ) : 𝕜) ≠ 0 := by
    norm_cast
    exact q.pos.ne.symm
  rw [← q.num_divInt_den, Rat.cast_divInt_of_ne_zero _ this, Int.cast_natCast, Rat.num_divInt_den,
    addOrderOf_div_of_gcd_eq_one' q.pos q.reduced]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantcb29d9fae3e7d3b7fed6f50de80f08a5781c7052c8d4d7a35498601a1dc2f746.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantcb29d9fae3e7d3b7fed6f50de80f08a5781c7052c8d4d7a35498601a1dc2f746.lean#L625).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
