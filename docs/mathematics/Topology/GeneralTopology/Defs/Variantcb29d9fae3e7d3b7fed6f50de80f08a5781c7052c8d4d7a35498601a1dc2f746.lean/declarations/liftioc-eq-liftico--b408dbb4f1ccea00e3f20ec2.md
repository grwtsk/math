## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3cefab51-7abc-c375-33d7-f084b93856e4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 805–813.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem liftIoc_eq_liftIco {f : 𝕜 → B} (hf : f a = f (a + p)) :
    liftIoc p a f = liftIco p a f := by
  ext q
  obtain ⟨x, hx, rfl⟩ := by simpa only [mem_image] using coe_image_Ico_eq p a ▸ mem_univ q
  rw [liftIco_coe_apply hx]
  obtain (⟨rfl, -⟩ | h) := by rwa [mem_Ico, le_iff_eq_or_lt, or_and_right] at hx
  · rw [← coe_add_period, liftIoc_coe_apply (by simp [hp.out]), hf]
  · exact liftIoc_coe_apply ⟨h.1, h.2.le⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantcb29d9fae3e7d3b7fed6f50de80f08a5781c7052c8d4d7a35498601a1dc2f746.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantcb29d9fae3e7d3b7fed6f50de80f08a5781c7052c8d4d7a35498601a1dc2f746.lean#L805).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dc71366f4c55aaf40d5382f07cce3231dc3986f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
