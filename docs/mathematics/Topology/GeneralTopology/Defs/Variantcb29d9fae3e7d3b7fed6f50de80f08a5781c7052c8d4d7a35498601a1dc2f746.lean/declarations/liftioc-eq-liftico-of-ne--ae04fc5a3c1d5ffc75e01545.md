## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:42532fca-fb5a-bbad-7fa1-433c61de4b4e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 384–389.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem liftIoc_eq_liftIco_of_ne {f : 𝕜 → B} {x : AddCircle p}
    (x_ne_a : x ≠ a) : liftIoc p a f x = liftIco p a f x := by
  have x_eq_b : x = ↑(equivIco p a x) := coe_equivIco.symm
  rw [x_eq_b, liftIco_coe_apply (equivIco p a x).coe_prop]
  exact liftIoc_coe_apply (by grind)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantcb29d9fae3e7d3b7fed6f50de80f08a5781c7052c8d4d7a35498601a1dc2f746.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantcb29d9fae3e7d3b7fed6f50de80f08a5781c7052c8d4d7a35498601a1dc2f746.lean#L384).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dc71366f4c55aaf40d5382f07cce3231dc3986f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
