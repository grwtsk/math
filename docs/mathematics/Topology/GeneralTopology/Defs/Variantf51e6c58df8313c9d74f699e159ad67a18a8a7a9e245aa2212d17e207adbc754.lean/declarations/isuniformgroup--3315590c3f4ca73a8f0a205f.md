## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:df417ecaaf5178036e8b172e5d90957536e5f7dabda164f351eb5053dac83b70`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 197–211.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class IsUniformGroup (α : Type*) [UniformSpace α] [Group α] : Prop where
  uniformContinuous_div : UniformContinuous fun p : α × α => p.1 / p.2

/-- A uniform additive group is an additive group in which addition and negation are
uniformly continuous.

`IsUniformAddGroup G` is equivalent to the fact that `G` is a topological additive group, and the
uniformity coincides with **both** the associated left and right uniformities
(see `IsUniformAddGroup.isRightUniformAddGroup`, `IsUniformAddGroup.isLeftUniformAddGroup` and
`IsUniformAddGroup.of_left_right`).

Since there are topological groups where these two uniformities do **not** coincide,
not all topological groups admit a uniform group structure in this sense. This is however the
case for commutative groups, which are the main motivation for the existence of this
typeclass. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantf51e6c58df8313c9d74f699e159ad67a18a8a7a9e245aa2212d17e207adbc754.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantf51e6c58df8313c9d74f699e159ad67a18a8a7a9e245aa2212d17e207adbc754.lean#L197).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d402323ea598a9e547043be96dce8346ec4d7c73` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
