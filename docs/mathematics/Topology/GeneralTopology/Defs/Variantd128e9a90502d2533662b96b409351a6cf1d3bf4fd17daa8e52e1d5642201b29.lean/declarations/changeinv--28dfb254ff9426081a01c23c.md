## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b1a1c633f1b53f8ccab2c743753ad986843c5428359ca75e7b899d8dd5d6f791`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 177–186.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def changeInv (f : X ≃ₜ Y) (g : Y → X) (hg : Function.RightInverse g f) : X ≃ₜ Y :=
  haveI : g = f.symm := (f.left_inv.eq_rightInverse hg).symm
  { toFun := f
    invFun := g
    left_inv := by convert f.left_inv
    right_inv := by convert f.right_inv using 1
    continuous_toFun := f.continuous
    continuous_invFun := by convert f.symm.continuous }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantd128e9a90502d2533662b96b409351a6cf1d3bf4fd17daa8e52e1d5642201b29.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantd128e9a90502d2533662b96b409351a6cf1d3bf4fd17daa8e52e1d5642201b29.lean#L177).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `493b234c94c467b6fa363b6b73f82b359856cb26` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
