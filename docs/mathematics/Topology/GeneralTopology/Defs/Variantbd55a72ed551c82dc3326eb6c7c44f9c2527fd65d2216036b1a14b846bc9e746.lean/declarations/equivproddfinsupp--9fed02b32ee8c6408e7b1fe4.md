## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:281538f3456e49487d7593bb29b50c55e5c047b3a9d0074b922b3f76e54fc669`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1210–1223.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def equivProdDFinsupp [∀ i, Zero (α i)] :
    (Π₀ i, α i) ≃ α none × Π₀ i, α (some i) where
  toFun f := (f none, comapDomain some (Option.some_injective _) f)
  invFun f := f.2.extendWith f.1
  left_inv f := by
    ext i; obtain - | i := i
    · rw [extendWith_none]
    · rw [extendWith_some, comapDomain_apply]
  right_inv x := by
    dsimp only
    ext
    · exact extendWith_none x.snd _
    · rw [comapDomain_apply, extendWith_some]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantbd55a72ed551c82dc3326eb6c7c44f9c2527fd65d2216036b1a14b846bc9e746.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantbd55a72ed551c82dc3326eb6c7c44f9c2527fd65d2216036b1a14b846bc9e746.lean#L1210).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6bd57bc46ef53089e15ba6ae3ebaaa607c199002` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
