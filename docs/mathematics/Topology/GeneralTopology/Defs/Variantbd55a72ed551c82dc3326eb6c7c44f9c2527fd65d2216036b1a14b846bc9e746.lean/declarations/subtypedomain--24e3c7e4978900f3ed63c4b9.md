## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:07ce616af57c02a45713c06a286bc3f7fedf11c80315bd6e7605f271b1f4cc81`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 341–350.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def subtypeDomain [∀ i, Zero (β i)] (p : ι → Prop) [DecidablePred p] (x : Π₀ i, β i) :
    Π₀ i : Subtype p, β i :=
  ⟨fun i => x (i : ι),
    x.support'.map fun xs =>
      ⟨(Multiset.filter p xs.1).attach.map fun j => ⟨j.1, (Multiset.mem_filter.1 j.2).2⟩, fun i =>
        (xs.prop i).imp_left fun H =>
          Multiset.mem_map.2
            ⟨⟨i, Multiset.mem_filter.2 ⟨H, i.2⟩⟩, Multiset.mem_attach _ _, Subtype.eta _ _⟩⟩⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantbd55a72ed551c82dc3326eb6c7c44f9c2527fd65d2216036b1a14b846bc9e746.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantbd55a72ed551c82dc3326eb6c7c44f9c2527fd65d2216036b1a14b846bc9e746.lean#L341).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6bd57bc46ef53089e15ba6ae3ebaaa607c199002` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
