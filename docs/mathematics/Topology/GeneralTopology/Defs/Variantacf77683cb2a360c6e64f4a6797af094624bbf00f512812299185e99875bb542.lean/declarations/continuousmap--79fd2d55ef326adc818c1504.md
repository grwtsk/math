## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cdceb62939f4b9efcab0a4ef7c8dd0f0b973df1c011cfcb6e0a7a053e017eec2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 36–49.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ContinuousMap (X Y : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] where
  /-- The function `X → Y` -/
  protected toFun : X → Y
  /-- Proposition that `toFun` is continuous -/
  protected continuous_toFun : Continuous toFun := by continuity

/-- `C(X, Y)` is the type of continuous maps from `X` to `Y`. -/
notation "C(" X ", " Y ")" => ContinuousMap X Y

section

/-- `ContinuousMapClass F X Y` states that `F` is a type of continuous maps.

You should extend this class when you extend `ContinuousMap`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantacf77683cb2a360c6e64f4a6797af094624bbf00f512812299185e99875bb542.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantacf77683cb2a360c6e64f4a6797af094624bbf00f512812299185e99875bb542.lean#L36).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7b56f834f87109c1d1f4277bfb18ef5176e96383` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
