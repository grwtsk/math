## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:efb72dd9cf96a21ab6c1aaa3556e55d41038d02aeffc333b5296e2be448fe030`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 92–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class IsLeftUniformAddGroup (G : Type*) [UniformSpace G] [AddGroup G] : Prop
    extends IsTopologicalAddGroup G where
  uniformity_eq :
    𝓤 G = comap (fun x : G × G ↦ (-x.1) + x.2) (𝓝 0)

/-- A **left-uniform group** is a topological group endowed with the associated
left uniform structure: the uniformity filter `𝓤 G` is the inverse image of `𝓝 1` by the map
`(x, y) ↦ x⁻¹ * y`.

In other words, we declare that two points `x` and `y` are infinitely close
precisely when `x⁻¹ * y` is infinitely close to `1`. -/
@[to_additive]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantba72a4d85a4a1cda8b0dff2d41b615eae2122bc5b684e31543898292abce0808.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantba72a4d85a4a1cda8b0dff2d41b615eae2122bc5b684e31543898292abce0808.lean#L92).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e2d31affc2b2cd879c6538fe49e479210a7934e4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
