## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6a6671ee4b02208000c485e7f114ec7e0750486dfd215a3e1f154ac515f24acd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–151.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure UniqueDiffWithinAt (s : Set E) (x : E) : Prop where
  dense_tangentConeAt : Dense (Submodule.span R (tangentConeAt R s x) : Set E)
  mem_closure : x ∈ closure s

/-- A property ensuring that the tangent cone to `s` at any of its points spans a dense subset of
the whole space. The main role of this property is to ensure that the differential along `s` is
unique, hence this name. The uniqueness it asserts is proved in `UniqueDiffOn.eq` in
`Mathlib/Analysis/Calculus/FDeriv/Basic.lean`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variant8a1f380676195f3930c2cf8817bb40835885c6b8d6471f5f3725db877a6fb123.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variant8a1f380676195f3930c2cf8817bb40835885c6b8d6471f5f3725db877a6fb123.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `14b08a77f07a1828a90b11776a2c6a305aa1ddf6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
