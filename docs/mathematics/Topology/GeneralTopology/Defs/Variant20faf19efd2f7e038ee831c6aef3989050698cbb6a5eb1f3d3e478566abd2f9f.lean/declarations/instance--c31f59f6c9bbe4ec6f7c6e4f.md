## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:46a2a75aca88e47c25c2fa56d7583fe088979d7b870d4af5342ef426b58fb15c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 446–464.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : HomeomorphClass (α ≃ₜ β) α β where
  map_continuous e := e.continuous_toFun
  inv_continuous e := e.continuous_invFun

end HomeomorphClass

section IsHomeomorph

variable [TopologicalSpace X] [TopologicalSpace Y] [TopologicalSpace Z] {f : X → Y}

/-- Predicate saying that `f` is a homeomorphism.

This should be used only when `f` is a concrete function whose continuous inverse is not easy to
write down. Otherwise, `Homeomorph` should be preferred as it bundles the continuous inverse.

Having both `Homeomorph` and `IsHomeomorph` is justified by the fact that so many function
properties are unbundled in the topology part of the library, and by the fact that a homeomorphism
is not merely a continuous bijection, that is `IsHomeomorph f` is not equivalent to
`Continuous f ∧ Bijective f` but to `Continuous f ∧ Bijective f ∧ IsOpenMap f`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variant20faf19efd2f7e038ee831c6aef3989050698cbb6a5eb1f3d3e478566abd2f9f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variant20faf19efd2f7e038ee831c6aef3989050698cbb6a5eb1f3d3e478566abd2f9f.lean#L446).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `224c640df2eada4d7e2dda00a45ca5598780d17b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
