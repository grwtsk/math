## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bbb02a96-6711-c4ba-0471-e1e4296ccd1d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 627–640.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Filter.HasBasis.biInter_biUnion_ball {p : ι → Prop} {U : ι → SetRel α α}
    (h : HasBasis (𝓤 α) p U) (s : Set α) :
    (⋂ (i) (_ : p i), ⋃ x ∈ s, ball x (U i)) = closure s := by
  ext x
  simp [mem_closure_iff_nhds_basis (nhds_basis_uniformity h), ball]

/-! ### Uniform continuity -/

variable [UniformSpace β]

/-- A function `f : α → β` is *uniformly continuous* if `(f x, f y)` tends to the diagonal
as `(x, y)` tends to the diagonal. In other words, if `x` is sufficiently close to `y`, then
`f x` is close to `f y` no matter where `x` and `y` are located in `α`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantbd811f41c74f8db72b9fb1374dc3f9548abed3090e5b328a1ce685f6acce027b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantbd811f41c74f8db72b9fb1374dc3f9548abed3090e5b328a1ce685f6acce027b.lean#L627).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a7ca24ff0eca4411aa019ed23786601cd626c017` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
