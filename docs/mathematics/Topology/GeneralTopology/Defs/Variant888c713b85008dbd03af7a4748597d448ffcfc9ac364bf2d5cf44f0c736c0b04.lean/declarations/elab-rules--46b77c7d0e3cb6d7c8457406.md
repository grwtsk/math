## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `elab_rules` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b48532a2ad730bc976aff318c3e8ac2a31c70b7198077fb73dd520fbacc9ac14`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 556–576.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
elab_rules : tactic
| `(tactic| filter_upwards $[[$[$args],*]]? $[with $wth*]? $[using $usingArg]?) => do
  focus do
    let config : ApplyConfig := {newGoals := ApplyNewGoals.nonDependentOnly}
    for e in args.getD #[] |>.reverse do
      let goal ← getMainGoal
      replaceMainGoal <| ← goal.withContext <| runTermElab do
        let m ← mkFreshExprMVar none
        let lem ← Term.elabTermEnsuringType
          (← ``(Filter.mp_mem $e $(← Term.exprToSyntax m))) (← goal.getType)
        goal.assign lem
        return [m.mvarId!]
    liftMetaTactic fun goal => do
      goal.apply (← mkConstWithFreshMVarLevels ``Filter.univ_mem') config
    evalTactic <|← `(tactic| try dsimp -zeta only [Set.mem_ofPred_eq])
    if let some l := wth then
      evalTactic <|← `(tactic| intro $[$l]*)
    if let some e := usingArg then
      evalTactic <|← `(tactic| exact $e)

end Mathlib.Tactic
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variant888c713b85008dbd03af7a4748597d448ffcfc9ac364bf2d5cf44f0c736c0b04.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variant888c713b85008dbd03af7a4748597d448ffcfc9ac364bf2d5cf44f0c736c0b04.lean#L556).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `60e7e458ccdb4eeceef9a4a8197d71cce889b8a2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
