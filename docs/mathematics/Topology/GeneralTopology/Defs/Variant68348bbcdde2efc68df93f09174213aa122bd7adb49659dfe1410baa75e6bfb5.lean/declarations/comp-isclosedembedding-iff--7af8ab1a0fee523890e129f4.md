## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:09b10a95-2026-267e-c243-580b64f08f99`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 397–403.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem comp_isClosedEmbedding_iff (e : Y ≃ₜ Z) {f : X → Y} :
    IsClosedEmbedding (e ∘ f) ↔ IsClosedEmbedding f :=
  e.isClosedEmbedding.of_comp_iff

variable (X Y) in
/-- If both `X` and `Y` have a unique element, then `X ≃ₜ Y`. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variant68348bbcdde2efc68df93f09174213aa122bd7adb49659dfe1410baa75e6bfb5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variant68348bbcdde2efc68df93f09174213aa122bd7adb49659dfe1410baa75e6bfb5.lean#L397).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `573e0982447a575324c02219bd5d1d369fec1086` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
