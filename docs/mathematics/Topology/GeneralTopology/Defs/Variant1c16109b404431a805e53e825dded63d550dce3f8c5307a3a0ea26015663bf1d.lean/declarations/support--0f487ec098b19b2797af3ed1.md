## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:39265ab1e56e40bd673814f0089db937630ed18417a300ccb41a6bb05c53aaac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 816–828.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def support (f : Π₀ i, β i) : Finset ι :=
  (f.support'.lift fun xs => (Multiset.toFinset xs.1).filter fun i => f i ≠ 0) <| by
    rintro ⟨sx, hx⟩ ⟨sy, hy⟩
    dsimp only [Subtype.coe_mk, toFun_eq_coe] at *
    ext i; constructor
    · intro H
      rcases Finset.mem_filter.1 H with ⟨_, h⟩
      exact Finset.mem_filter.2 ⟨Multiset.mem_toFinset.2 <| (hy i).resolve_right h, h⟩
    · intro H
      rcases Finset.mem_filter.1 H with ⟨_, h⟩
      exact Finset.mem_filter.2 ⟨Multiset.mem_toFinset.2 <| (hx i).resolve_right h, h⟩

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variant1c16109b404431a805e53e825dded63d550dce3f8c5307a3a0ea26015663bf1d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variant1c16109b404431a805e53e825dded63d550dce3f8c5307a3a0ea26015663bf1d.lean#L816).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `508e6b417841822f3735dba061237c026e730a2d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
