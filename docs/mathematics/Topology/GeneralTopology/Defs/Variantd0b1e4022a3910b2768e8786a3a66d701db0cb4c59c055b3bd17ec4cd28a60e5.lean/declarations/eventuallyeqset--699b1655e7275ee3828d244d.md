## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6ace2217fe76fbebec5b82358b02a6089bfd9343e695567aec9e95a085a9c59f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 310–317.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def EventuallyEqSet (l : Filter α) (s t : Set α) : Prop :=
  EventuallyEq l (fun x => x ∈ s) (fun x => x ∈ t)

/-- A set `s` is *eventually contained* in a set `t` along a filter `l` if the set of `x` such that
`x ∈ s → x ∈ t` belongs to `l`.

This is definitionally `(· ∈ s) ≤ᶠ[l] (· ∈ t)`, but it is a separate definition (rather than an
abbreviation) to avoid simp unfolding membership of concrete sets. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantd0b1e4022a3910b2768e8786a3a66d701db0cb4c59c055b3bd17ec4cd28a60e5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantd0b1e4022a3910b2768e8786a3a66d701db0cb4c59c055b3bd17ec4cd28a60e5.lean#L310).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `760285d16af8795fa73313254a28aa651c9d0883` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
