## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ff5e4a88-1292-51ba-5677-a7dc62d57889`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 974–982.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem zipWith_def {ι : Type u} {β : ι → Type v} {β₁ : ι → Type v₁} {β₂ : ι → Type v₂}
    [dec : DecidableEq ι] [∀ i : ι, Zero (β i)] [∀ i : ι, Zero (β₁ i)] [∀ i : ι, Zero (β₂ i)]
    [∀ (i : ι) (x : β₁ i), Decidable (x ≠ 0)] [∀ (i : ι) (x : β₂ i), Decidable (x ≠ 0)]
    {f : ∀ i, β₁ i → β₂ i → β i} {hf : ∀ i, f i 0 0 = 0} {g₁ : Π₀ i, β₁ i} {g₂ : Π₀ i, β₂ i} :
    zipWith f hf g₁ g₂ = mk (g₁.support ∪ g₂.support) fun i => f i.1 (g₁ i.1) (g₂ i.1) := by
  ext i
  by_cases h1 : g₁ i ≠ 0 <;> by_cases h2 : g₂ i ≠ 0 <;> simp only [not_not, Ne] at h1 h2 <;>
    simp [h1, h2, hf]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantbd75032af3642f357447b508c4a3125a6a6a9a788847c400404089b98992f59c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantbd75032af3642f357447b508c4a3125a6a6a9a788847c400404089b98992f59c.lean#L974).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c4f0537cd074228bcd759c3f288cdade0fc2959` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
