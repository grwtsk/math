## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a48b14c7f50640b1ba59bf8d838f83e8945d5215cf70f08a4f40acf99f5449ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 150–168.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def zipWith (f : ∀ i, β₁ i → β₂ i → β i) (hf : ∀ i, f i 0 0 = 0) (x : Π₀ i, β₁ i) (y : Π₀ i, β₂ i) :
    Π₀ i, β i :=
  ⟨fun i => f i (x i) (y i), by
    refine x.support'.bind fun xs => ?_
    refine y.support'.map fun ys => ?_
    refine ⟨xs + ys, fun i => ?_⟩
    obtain h1 | (h1 : x i = 0) := xs.prop i
    · left
      rw [Multiset.mem_add]
      left
      exact h1
    obtain h2 | (h2 : y i = 0) := ys.prop i
    · left
      rw [Multiset.mem_add]
      right
      exact h2
    right; rw [← hf, ← h1, ← h2]⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantbd75032af3642f357447b508c4a3125a6a6a9a788847c400404089b98992f59c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variantbd75032af3642f357447b508c4a3125a6a6a9a788847c400404089b98992f59c.lean#L150).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c4f0537cd074228bcd759c3f288cdade0fc2959` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
