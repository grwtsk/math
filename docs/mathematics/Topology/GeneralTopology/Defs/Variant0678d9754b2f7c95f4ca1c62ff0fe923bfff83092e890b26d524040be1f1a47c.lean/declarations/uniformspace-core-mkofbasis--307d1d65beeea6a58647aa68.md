## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2890493c18b100d6bf4df77617bc06d31d0c1ce221be96cf2559e307f5c2fbd3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 157–166.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def UniformSpace.Core.mkOfBasis {α : Type u} (B : FilterBasis (α × α))
    (refl : ∀ r ∈ B, ∀ (x), (x, x) ∈ r) (symm : ∀ r ∈ B, ∃ t ∈ B, t ⊆ Prod.swap ⁻¹' r)
    (comp : ∀ r ∈ B, ∃ t ∈ B, t ○ t ⊆ r) : UniformSpace.Core α where
  uniformity := B.filter
  refl := B.hasBasis.ge_iff.mpr fun _r ru => SetRel.id_subset_iff.2 ⟨refl _ ru⟩
  symm := (B.hasBasis.tendsto_iff B.hasBasis).mpr symm
  comp := ((B.hasBasis.lift' (monotone_id.relComp monotone_id)).le_basis_iff B.hasBasis).2 comp

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variant0678d9754b2f7c95f4ca1c62ff0fe923bfff83092e890b26d524040be1f1a47c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variant0678d9754b2f7c95f4ca1c62ff0fe923bfff83092e890b26d524040be1f1a47c.lean#L157).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3f068a41cafe8605be201dd24b3843bcbba45a6e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
