## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cd5d211404850cb676e666f4b537b7228f750dca4d6248faf09dfa1a60e95cf5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 195–207.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class UniformSpace (α : Type u) extends TopologicalSpace α where
  /-- The uniformity filter. -/
  protected uniformity : Filter (α × α)
  /-- If `s ∈ uniformity`, then `Prod.swap ⁻¹' s ∈ uniformity`. -/
  protected symm : Tendsto Prod.swap uniformity uniformity
  /-- For every set `u ∈ uniformity`, there exists `v ∈ uniformity` such that `v ○ v ⊆ u`. -/
  protected comp : (uniformity.lift' fun s => s ○ s) ≤ uniformity
  /-- The uniformity agrees with the topology: the neighborhoods filter of each point `x`
  is equal to `Filter.comap (Prod.mk x) (𝓤 α)`. -/
  protected nhds_eq_comap_uniformity (x : α) : 𝓝 x = comap (Prod.mk x) uniformity

/-- The uniformity is a filter on α × α (inferred from an ambient uniform space
  structure on α). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variant0678d9754b2f7c95f4ca1c62ff0fe923bfff83092e890b26d524040be1f1a47c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Defs/Variant0678d9754b2f7c95f4ca1c62ff0fe923bfff83092e890b26d524040be1f1a47c.lean#L195).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3f068a41cafe8605be201dd24b3843bcbba45a6e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
