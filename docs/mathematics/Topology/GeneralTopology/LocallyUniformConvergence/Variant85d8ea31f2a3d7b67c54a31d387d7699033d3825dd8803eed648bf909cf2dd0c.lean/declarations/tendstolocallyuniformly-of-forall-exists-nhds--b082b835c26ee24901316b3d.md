## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:09e0d4e6-71b1-3413-7927-a66f8a2de959`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 189–197.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma tendstoLocallyUniformly_of_forall_exists_nhds
    (h : ∀ x, ∃ t ∈ 𝓝 x, TendstoUniformlyOn F f p t) :
    TendstoLocallyUniformly F f p :=
  tendstoLocallyUniformlyOn_univ.mp
    <| tendstoLocallyUniformlyOn_of_forall_exists_nhds (by simpa using h)

@[deprecated (since := "2025-05-22")] alias tendstoLocallyUniformly_of_forall_exists_nhd :=
  tendstoLocallyUniformly_of_forall_exists_nhds

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyUniformConvergence/Variant85d8ea31f2a3d7b67c54a31d387d7699033d3825dd8803eed648bf909cf2dd0c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyUniformConvergence/Variant85d8ea31f2a3d7b67c54a31d387d7699033d3825dd8803eed648bf909cf2dd0c.lean#L189).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5e6e5146d49d4d4ca1f29f835a3dbe0a7bc16fd9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
