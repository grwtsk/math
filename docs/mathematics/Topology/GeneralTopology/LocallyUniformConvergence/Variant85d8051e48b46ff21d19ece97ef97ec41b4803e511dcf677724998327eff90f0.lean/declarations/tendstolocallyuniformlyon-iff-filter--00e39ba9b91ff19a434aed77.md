## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1908eec7-f189-176a-4205-5a4a43015f94`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 218–228.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendstoLocallyUniformlyOn_iff_filter :
    TendstoLocallyUniformlyOn F f p s ↔ ∀ x ∈ s, TendstoUniformlyOnFilter F f p (𝓝[s] x) := by
  simp only [TendstoUniformlyOnFilter, eventually_prod_iff]
  constructor
  · rintro h x hx u hu
    obtain ⟨s, hs1, hs2⟩ := h u hu x hx
    exact ⟨_, hs2, _, eventually_of_mem hs1 fun x => id, fun hi y hy => hi y hy⟩
  · rintro h u hu x hx
    obtain ⟨pa, hpa, pb, hpb, h⟩ := h x hx u hu
    exact ⟨pb, hpb, eventually_of_mem hpa fun i hi y hy => h hi hy⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyUniformConvergence/Variant85d8051e48b46ff21d19ece97ef97ec41b4803e511dcf677724998327eff90f0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyUniformConvergence/Variant85d8051e48b46ff21d19ece97ef97ec41b4803e511dcf677724998327eff90f0.lean#L218).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `084041ee3b5f5e565688f6e5195a998c10f0a379` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
