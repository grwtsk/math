## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2f0b8f11-b29e-76b3-aba8-9ffd668d1cfc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendstoLocallyUniformlyOn_iff_forall_tendsto :
    TendstoLocallyUniformlyOn F f p s ↔
      ∀ x ∈ s, Tendsto (fun y : ι × α => (f y.2, F y.1 y.2)) (p ×ˢ 𝓝[s] x) (𝓤 β) :=
  forall₂_comm.trans <| forall₄_congr fun _ _ _ _ => by
    simp_rw [mem_map, mem_prod_iff_right, mem_preimage]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyUniformConvergence/Variant711ed634256603f465c40cc36bedce211a7bb27baa36e0d2be749c1aa2c50def.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyUniformConvergence/Variant711ed634256603f465c40cc36bedce211a7bb27baa36e0d2be749c1aa2c50def.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `10609935c04dad50b1809882a3466c13694fec00` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
