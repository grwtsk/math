## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:75cc924f-271d-f057-558c-a371d2fdce08`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 221–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem counting_exact (x : ℝ) (hx : 2 ≤ x) :
    weightedPrefix (Real.log x) = x - 2 + amplitude / 3 *
      (x ^ (3 / 4 : ℝ) - (2 : ℝ) ^ (3 / 4 : ℝ)) := by
  have hx0 : 0 < x := by linarith
  have ht : onset ≤ Real.log x := Real.log_le_log (by norm_num) hx
  rw [weightedPrefix_above ht, Real.exp_log hx0]
  rw [Real.rpow_def_of_pos hx0, Real.rpow_def_of_pos (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) < 2)]
  unfold onset
  rw [show 3 * Real.log x / 4 = Real.log x * (3 / 4) by ring,
    show 3 * Real.log 2 / 4 = Real.log 2 * (3 / 4) by ring]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/MonotoneMatchingMeasure/Varianta29b193389ffa878ae42ebd3ca68277e7618100b10f363f798e89cf657b529d2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/MonotoneMatchingMeasure/Varianta29b193389ffa878ae42ebd3ca68277e7618100b10f363f798e89cf657b529d2.lean#L221).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a20891b6fd74ae495aa25635f625364890d6e760` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
