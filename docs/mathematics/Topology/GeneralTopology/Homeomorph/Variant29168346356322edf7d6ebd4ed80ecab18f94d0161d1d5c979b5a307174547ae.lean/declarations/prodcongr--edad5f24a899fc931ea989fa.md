## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6e9345e3fa80aa87d959e33e86ca87810750c6f7ad0f5b39b4a29339792c7526`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 506–512.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def prodCongr (h₁ : α ≃ₜ β) (h₂ : γ ≃ₜ δ) : α × γ ≃ₜ β × δ where
  continuous_toFun := h₁.continuous.prod_map h₂.continuous
  continuous_invFun := h₁.symm.continuous.prod_map h₂.symm.continuous
  toEquiv := h₁.toEquiv.prodCongr h₂.toEquiv
#align homeomorph.prod_congr Homeomorph.prodCongr

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Homeomorph/Variant29168346356322edf7d6ebd4ed80ecab18f94d0161d1d5c979b5a307174547ae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Homeomorph/Variant29168346356322edf7d6ebd4ed80ecab18f94d0161d1d5c979b5a307174547ae.lean#L506).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `59c70be60616f07ca272b74fba5111a136ef604f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
