## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:97129b4d05d104c0801db7b55ad26883678b4be0554f4324cf770a76e4b3f574`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 678–694.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def piEquivPiSubtypeProd (p : ι → Prop) (β : ι → Type*) [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (β i)]
    [DecidablePred p] : (∀ i, β i) ≃ₜ (∀ i : { x // p x }, β i) × ∀ i : { x // ¬p x }, β i
    where
  toEquiv := Equiv.piEquivPiSubtypeProd p β
  continuous_toFun := by
    apply Continuous.prod_mk <;> exact continuous_pi fun j => continuous_apply j.1
  continuous_invFun :=
    continuous_pi fun j => by
      dsimp only [Equiv.piEquivPiSubtypeProd]; split_ifs
      exacts [(continuous_apply _).comp continuous_fst, (continuous_apply _).comp continuous_snd]
#align homeomorph.pi_equiv_pi_subtype_prod Homeomorph.piEquivPiSubtypeProd

variable [DecidableEq ι] (i : ι)

/-- A product of topological spaces can be split as the binary product of one of the spaces and
  the product of all the remaining spaces. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Homeomorph/Variant884d07a454e2b4efcb8e347a0a8295f7a62a4be1e25cfc641f61940f8bfd10e0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Homeomorph/Variant884d07a454e2b4efcb8e347a0a8295f7a62a4be1e25cfc641f61940f8bfd10e0.lean#L678).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `edc234877d46215795be0c391286cefce684913f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
