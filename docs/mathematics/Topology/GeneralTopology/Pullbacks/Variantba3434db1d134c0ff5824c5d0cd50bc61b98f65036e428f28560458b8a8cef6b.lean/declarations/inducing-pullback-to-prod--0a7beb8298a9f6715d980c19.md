## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5b000924-16c3-a023-17a9-1f97532ccdac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 182–186.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem inducing_pullback_to_prod {X Y Z : TopCat.{u}} (f : X ⟶ Z) (g : Y ⟶ Z) :
    Inducing <| ⇑(prod.lift pullback.fst pullback.snd : pullback f g ⟶ X ⨯ Y) :=
  ⟨by simp [prod_topology, pullback_topology, induced_compose, ← coe_comp]⟩
#align Top.inducing_pullback_to_prod TopCat.inducing_pullback_to_prod

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Pullbacks/Variantba3434db1d134c0ff5824c5d0cd50bc61b98f65036e428f28560458b8a8cef6b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Pullbacks/Variantba3434db1d134c0ff5824c5d0cd50bc61b98f65036e428f28560458b8a8cef6b.lean#L182).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `06816a9c7b22aef6668186e95cf95efa4af31281` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
