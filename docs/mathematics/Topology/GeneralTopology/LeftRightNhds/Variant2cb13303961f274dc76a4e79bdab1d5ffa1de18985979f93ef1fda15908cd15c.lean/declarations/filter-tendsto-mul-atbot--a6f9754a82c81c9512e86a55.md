## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3688c122-2251-59fd-ce43-03da974d8872`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 421–428.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Filter.Tendsto.mul_atBot' {C : α} (hf : Tendsto f l (𝓝 C)) (hg : Tendsto g l atBot) :
    Tendsto (fun x => f x * g x) l atBot :=
  Filter.Tendsto.mul_atTop' (α := αᵒᵈ) hf hg

/-- In a linearly ordered commutative group with the order topology,
if `f` tends to `atTop` and `g` tends to `C` then `f * g` tends to `atTop`. -/
@[to_additive atTop_add /-- In a linearly ordered additive commutative group with the order
topology, if `f` tends to `atTop` and `g` tends to `C` then `f + g` tends to `atTop`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LeftRightNhds/Variant2cb13303961f274dc76a4e79bdab1d5ffa1de18985979f93ef1fda15908cd15c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LeftRightNhds/Variant2cb13303961f274dc76a4e79bdab1d5ffa1de18985979f93ef1fda15908cd15c.lean#L421).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d7b16aa2e126a28d590b4725543080800f86dd9b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
