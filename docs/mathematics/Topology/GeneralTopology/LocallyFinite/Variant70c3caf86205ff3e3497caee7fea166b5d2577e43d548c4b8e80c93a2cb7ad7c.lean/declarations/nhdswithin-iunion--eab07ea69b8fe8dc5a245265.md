## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ff78590c-7d18-16bf-f234-2955fbf9c6a2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 66–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem nhdsWithin_iUnion (hf : LocallyFinite f) (a : X) :
    𝓝[⋃ i, f i] a = ⨆ i, 𝓝[f i] a := by
  rcases hf a with ⟨U, haU, hfin⟩
  refine le_antisymm ?_ (Monotone.le_map_iSup fun _ _ ↦ nhdsWithin_mono _)
  calc
    𝓝[⋃ i, f i] a = 𝓝[⋃ i, f i ∩ U] a := by
      rw [← iUnion_inter, ← nhdsWithin_inter_of_mem' (nhdsWithin_le_nhds haU)]
    _ = 𝓝[⋃ i ∈ {j | (f j ∩ U).Nonempty}, (f i ∩ U)] a := by
      simp only [mem_setOf_eq, iUnion_nonempty_self]
    _ = ⨆ i ∈ {j | (f j ∩ U).Nonempty}, 𝓝[f i ∩ U] a := nhdsWithin_biUnion hfin _ _
    _ ≤ ⨆ i, 𝓝[f i ∩ U] a := iSup₂_le_iSup _ _
    _ ≤ ⨆ i, 𝓝[f i] a := iSup_mono fun i ↦ nhdsWithin_mono _ inter_subset_left

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyFinite/Variant70c3caf86205ff3e3497caee7fea166b5d2577e43d548c4b8e80c93a2cb7ad7c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyFinite/Variant70c3caf86205ff3e3497caee7fea166b5d2577e43d548c4b8e80c93a2cb7ad7c.lean#L66).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `573732189552e9aef7fb9c78b281dcb2b0d9ded2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
