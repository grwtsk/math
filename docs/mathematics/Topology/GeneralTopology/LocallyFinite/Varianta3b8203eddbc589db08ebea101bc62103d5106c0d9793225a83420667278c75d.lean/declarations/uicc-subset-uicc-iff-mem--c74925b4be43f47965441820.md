## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:27e328e0-33be-7018-7b83-3e573ba7f537`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 948–951.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem uIcc_subset_uIcc_iff_mem : [[a₁, b₁]] ⊆ [[a₂, b₂]] ↔ a₁ ∈ [[a₂, b₂]] ∧ b₁ ∈ [[a₂, b₂]] :=
  ⟨fun h => ⟨h left_mem_uIcc, h right_mem_uIcc⟩, fun h => uIcc_subset_uIcc h.1 h.2⟩
#align finset.uIcc_subset_uIcc_iff_mem Finset.uIcc_subset_uIcc_iff_mem

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyFinite/Varianta3b8203eddbc589db08ebea101bc62103d5106c0d9793225a83420667278c75d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyFinite/Varianta3b8203eddbc589db08ebea101bc62103d5106c0d9793225a83420667278c75d.lean#L948).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `07690eda2f8498e868200ee71df29762b213e7b1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
