## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:86c90ff90fe7a8143b1b5ba3d8c14a85cc0e04595fbcd46fa89a7c5462342caf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 38–50.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure StieltjesFunction where
  toFun : ℝ → ℝ
  mono' : Monotone toFun
  right_continuous' : ∀ x, ContinuousWithinAt toFun (Ici x) x
#align stieltjes_function StieltjesFunction
#align stieltjes_function.to_fun StieltjesFunction.toFun
#align stieltjes_function.mono' StieltjesFunction.mono'
#align stieltjes_function.right_continuous' StieltjesFunction.right_continuous'

namespace StieltjesFunction

attribute [coe] toFun

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Stieltjes/Variantebcaf0abb5312b6d2210620be951b37a6340a7f906bfa292e79b33d18ebd2cbb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Stieltjes/Variantebcaf0abb5312b6d2210620be951b37a6340a7f906bfa292e79b33d18ebd2cbb.lean#L38).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `741a735ff1afa6ceabadb9c4775b5a82bcb12840` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
