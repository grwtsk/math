## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a1a45ae1-46dc-8027-4f2e-c37822571d60`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 377–456.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem outer_Ioc [DenselyOrdered R] (a b : R) : f.outer (Ioc a b) = ofReal (f b - f a) := by
  /- It suffices to show that, if `(a, b]` is covered by sets `s i`, then `f b - f a` is bounded
    by `∑ f.length (s i) + ε`. The difficulty is that `f.length` is expressed in terms of half-open
    intervals, while we would like to have a compact interval covered by open intervals to use
    compactness and finite sums, as provided by `length_subadditive_Icc_Ioo`. The trick is to use
    the right-continuity of `f`. If `a'` is close enough to `a` on its right, then `[a', b]` is
    still covered by the sets `s i` and moreover `f b - f a'` is very close to `f b - f a`
    (up to `ε/2`).
    Also, by definition one can cover `s i` by a half-closed interval `(p i, q i]` with `f`-length
    very close to that of `s i` (within a suitably small `ε' i`, say). If one moves `q i` very
    slightly to the right, then the `f`-length will change very little by right continuity, and we
    will get an open interval `(p i, q' i)` covering `s i` with `f (q' i) - f (p i)` within `ε' i`
    of the `f`-length of `s i`. This is not possible if `q i` is top, but this is not an issue
    as the interval `(p i, q i]` is already open in this case. However, this means that we can
    not use `Ioo` in this proof -- instead, we use `Iotop` precisely to avoid this issue. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Stieltjes/Variant330ce81572267d9a6a2d914f88847b875bb1872c7bbf18d3317f62f1ca8416c6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
