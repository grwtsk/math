## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:31377b94d7323f2fb025e1803fca9c6c67c0303276204717219c68a8cb93ee37`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 297–305.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def bilinearLineDerivTwo (f : V₁) : E →ₗ[R] E →ₗ[R] V₃ :=
  LinearMap.mk₂ R (∂_{·} <| ∂_{·} f) (by simp [lineDerivOp_left_add])
    (by simp [lineDerivOp_left_smul]) (by simp [lineDerivOp_left_add, lineDerivOp_add])
    (by simp [lineDerivOp_left_smul, lineDerivOp_smul])

variable (R) in
/-- The second derivative in terms `lineDerivOp` as a linear map from the tensor product.

Mainly used to give an abstract definition of the Laplacian. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/DerivNotation/Variantecd26bafd60f128b0d9649bbfbbd94d183297468563c2e85c8398445f7af08e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/DerivNotation/Variantecd26bafd60f128b0d9649bbfbbd94d183297468563c2e85c8398445f7af08e7.lean#L297).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `47997c07a835dac88abf2ab348a48c82cf869a9a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
