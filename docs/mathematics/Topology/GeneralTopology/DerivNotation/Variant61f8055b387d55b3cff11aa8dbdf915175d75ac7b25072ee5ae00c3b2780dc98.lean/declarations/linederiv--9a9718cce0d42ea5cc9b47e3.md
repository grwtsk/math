## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:672f4fac749cea0f66f27a14e0242eb403858094179ec392baa7f7811ff2a4c0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 46–58.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class LineDeriv (V : Type u) (E : Type v) (F : outParam (Type w)) where
  /-- `∂_{v} f` is the line derivative of `f` in direction `v`. The meaning of this notation is
  type-dependent. -/
  lineDerivOp : V → E → F

namespace LineDeriv

@[inherit_doc] scoped notation "∂_{" v "}" => LineDeriv.lineDerivOp v

variable {V E : Type*} [LineDeriv V E E]

/-- `∂^{m} f` is the iterated line derivative of `f`, where `m` is a finite number of (different)
directions. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/DerivNotation/Variant61f8055b387d55b3cff11aa8dbdf915175d75ac7b25072ee5ae00c3b2780dc98.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/DerivNotation/Variant61f8055b387d55b3cff11aa8dbdf915175d75ac7b25072ee5ae00c3b2780dc98.lean#L46).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7912bf4ca5ffa28b710ac5da31731f4ab4f36da8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
