## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:df941fb0-af87-9701-4ffb-3f4bc359c944`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 54–64.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem time_trace_integrable {A : ℝ} (hA : 1 ≤ A) (s : ℝ) :
    IntervalIntegrable (fun t => actualAdjointTimePrimitive A 0 t *
      actualTwistedTimeDensity A t s) volume
      (actualTimeLower A) (Real.log (sourceKernelCutoff A : ℝ)) := by
  have ht := (actual_orders hA).1
  have hp := (actualAdjointTimePrimitive_absolutelyContinuous A 0 _ ht).continuousOn
  rw [uIcc_of_le ht] at hp
  exact (hp.intervalIntegrable_of_Icc ht).mul_continuousOn
    (twisted_time_continuous (by linarith) s).continuousOn

/-- The actual critical homogeneous profile is subtracted from the actual column primitive. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/RootActualCriticalColumnTransfer/Variante239ed0147c5747f7c83ff779d914042ec4e05c2c23cfc86848c565fda9bb262.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/RootActualCriticalColumnTransfer/Variante239ed0147c5747f7c83ff779d914042ec4e05c2c23cfc86848c565fda9bb262.lean#L54).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6dbfb79e026a3521890cd2abbbba69fd8134bcf3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
