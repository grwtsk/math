## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c4c9feb3-92ca-13ad-bba2-d9c5da4b90e2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 385–394.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma changeOrigin_finite_of_finite (p : FormalMultilinearSeries 𝕜 E F) {n : ℕ}
    (hn : ∀ (m : ℕ), n ≤ m → p m = 0) {k : ℕ} (hk : n ≤ k) :
    p.changeOrigin x k = 0 := by
  rw [changeOrigin, p.changeOriginSeries_sum_eq_partialSum_of_finite hn]
  apply Finset.sum_eq_zero
  intro m hm
  rw [Finset.mem_range] at hm
  rw [p.changeOriginSeries_finite_of_finite hn k (le_add_of_le_left hk),
    ContinuousMultilinearMap.zero_apply]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CPolynomialDef/Variantb988c3b1aff7ad71ec6aacc483d5ecb10920bf9765c983d0f937569ede009783.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CPolynomialDef/Variantb988c3b1aff7ad71ec6aacc483d5ecb10920bf9765c983d0f937569ede009783.lean#L385).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fa7e1c740894a3be648b71ad686c0f7b11e831b6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
