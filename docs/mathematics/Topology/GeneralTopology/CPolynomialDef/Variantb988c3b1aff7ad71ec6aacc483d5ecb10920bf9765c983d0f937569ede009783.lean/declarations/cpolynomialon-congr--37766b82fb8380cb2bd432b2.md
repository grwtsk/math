## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c4e9715-054d-0aca-aea9-d003b68bddce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 201–206.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem CPolynomialOn_congr {s : Set E} (hs : IsOpen s) (h : s.EqOn f g) :
    CPolynomialOn 𝕜 f s ↔ CPolynomialOn 𝕜 g s :=
  ⟨fun hf => hf.congr hs h, fun hg => hg.congr hs h.symm⟩

/-- If a function `f` has a finite power series `p` on a ball and `g` is a continuous linear map,
then `g ∘ f` has the finite power series `g ∘ p` on the same ball. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CPolynomialDef/Variantb988c3b1aff7ad71ec6aacc483d5ecb10920bf9765c983d0f937569ede009783.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CPolynomialDef/Variantb988c3b1aff7ad71ec6aacc483d5ecb10920bf9765c983d0f937569ede009783.lean#L201).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fa7e1c740894a3be648b71ad686c0f7b11e831b6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
