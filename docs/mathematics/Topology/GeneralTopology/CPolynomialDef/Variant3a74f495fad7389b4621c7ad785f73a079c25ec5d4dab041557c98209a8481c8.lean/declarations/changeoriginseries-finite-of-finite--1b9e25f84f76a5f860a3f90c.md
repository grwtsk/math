## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8cae89e6-bb58-008b-0c97-62f72bd724ff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 365–371.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma changeOriginSeries_finite_of_finite (p : FormalMultilinearSeries 𝕜 E F) {n : ℕ}
    (hn : ∀ (m : ℕ), n ≤ m → p m = 0) (k : ℕ) : ∀ {m : ℕ}, n ≤ k + m →
    p.changeOriginSeries k m = 0 := by
  intro m hm
  rw [changeOriginSeries]
  exact Finset.sum_eq_zero (fun _ _ => p.changeOriginSeriesTerm_bound hn _ _ _ hm)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CPolynomialDef/Variant3a74f495fad7389b4621c7ad785f73a079c25ec5d4dab041557c98209a8481c8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CPolynomialDef/Variant3a74f495fad7389b4621c7ad785f73a079c25ec5d4dab041557c98209a8481c8.lean#L365).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `650a469cdcfe97723fc63b3d9b6cfa1e43ff4ad1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
