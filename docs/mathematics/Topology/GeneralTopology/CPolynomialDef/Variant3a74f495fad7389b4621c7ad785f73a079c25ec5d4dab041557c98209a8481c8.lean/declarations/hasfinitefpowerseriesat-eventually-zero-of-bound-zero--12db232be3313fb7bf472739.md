## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f317e1a9-c175-c81e-8653-61f6c5752bcf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 269–275.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem HasFiniteFPowerSeriesAt.eventually_zero_of_bound_zero
    (hf : HasFiniteFPowerSeriesAt f pf x 0) : f =ᶠ[𝓝 x] 0 :=
  Filter.eventuallyEq_iff_exists_mem.mpr (let ⟨r, hf⟩ := hf; ⟨Metric.eball x r,
    Metric.eball_mem_nhds x hf.r_pos, fun y hy ↦ hf.eq_zero_of_bound_zero y hy⟩)

/-- If `f` has a formal power series on a ball bounded by `1`, then `f` is constant equal
to `f x` on the ball. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CPolynomialDef/Variant3a74f495fad7389b4621c7ad785f73a079c25ec5d4dab041557c98209a8481c8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CPolynomialDef/Variant3a74f495fad7389b4621c7ad785f73a079c25ec5d4dab041557c98209a8481c8.lean#L269).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `650a469cdcfe97723fc63b3d9b6cfa1e43ff4ad1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
