## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ff57bd3c-e8ad-dd4d-4eac-f0ae650b03c6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 131–145.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Valued.continuous_valuation [hv : Valued K Γ₀] :
    Continuous (v.restrict : K → (ValueGroup₀ (.ofClass hv.v))) := by
  rw [continuous_iff_continuousAt]
  intro x
  rcases eq_or_ne x 0 with (rfl | h)
  · rw [ContinuousAt, map_zero, WithZeroTopology.tendsto_zero]
    intro γ hγ
    rw [Filter.Eventually, Valued.mem_nhds_zero]
    use Units.mk0 γ hγ; rfl
  · have v_ne : (v.restrict x : ValueGroup₀ (.ofClass hv.v)) ≠ 0 :=
      (Valuation.ne_zero_iff _).mpr h
    rw [ContinuousAt, WithZeroTopology.tendsto_of_ne_zero v_ne]
    simp_rw [v.restrict_inj]
    apply Valued.locally_const (by simpa [restrict₀_apply] using v_ne)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ValuedField/Variant26ff73e4b36cddb7d32358767926a72f313b73391afd1e4387cf8350a4652f82.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ValuedField/Variant26ff73e4b36cddb7d32358767926a72f313b73391afd1e4387cf8350a4652f82.lean#L131).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `52ee14416de300957883ed402d9fc6fe7f66c27e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
