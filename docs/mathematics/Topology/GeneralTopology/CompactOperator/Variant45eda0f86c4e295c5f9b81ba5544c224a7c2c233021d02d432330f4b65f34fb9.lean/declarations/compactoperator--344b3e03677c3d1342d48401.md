## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:48a2cfe12cdc3d3a4d2abbb877c5179ade3c98671b68e0a74e828da9f6a9b7cb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 246–261.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def compactOperator [Module R₁ M₁] [Module R₄ M₄] [ContinuousConstSMul R₄ M₄]
    [TopologicalAddGroup M₄] : Submodule R₄ (M₁ →SL[σ₁₄] M₄) where
  carrier := { f | IsCompactOperator f }
  add_mem' hf hg := hf.add hg
  zero_mem' := isCompactOperator_zero
  smul_mem' c _ hf := hf.smul c
#align compact_operator compactOperator

  {σ₂₃ : R₂ →+* R₃} {M₁ M₂ M₃ : Type*} [TopologicalSpace M₁] [TopologicalSpace M₂]
  [TopologicalSpace M₃] [AddCommMonoid M₁] [Module R₁ M₁]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactOperator/Variant45eda0f86c4e295c5f9b81ba5544c224a7c2c233021d02d432330f4b65f34fb9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactOperator/Variant45eda0f86c4e295c5f9b81ba5544c224a7c2c233021d02d432330f4b65f34fb9.lean#L246).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d68de6ae879308632034bf3882b05e94c3790b10` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
