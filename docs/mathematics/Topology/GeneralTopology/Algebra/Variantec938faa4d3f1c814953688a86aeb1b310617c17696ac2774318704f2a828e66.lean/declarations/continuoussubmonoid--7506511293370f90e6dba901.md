## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:831b723d9382c6e5ee7c6ba871c614d94b2d0b9fe12a6ca504a91715f990857a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 228–235.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def continuousSubmonoid (α : Type*) (β : Type*) [TopologicalSpace α] [TopologicalSpace β]
    [MulOneClass β] [ContinuousMul β] : Submonoid (α → β) where
  carrier := { f : α → β | Continuous f }
  one_mem' := @continuous_const _ _ _ _ 1
  mul_mem' fc gc := fc.mul gc

/-- The subgroup of continuous maps `α → β`. -/
@[to_additive /-- The `AddSubgroup` of continuous maps `α → β`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Algebra/Variantec938faa4d3f1c814953688a86aeb1b310617c17696ac2774318704f2a828e66.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Algebra/Variantec938faa4d3f1c814953688a86aeb1b310617c17696ac2774318704f2a828e66.lean#L228).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ff3d01f255b2b565cb660cba3b140618c2d1d1c6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
