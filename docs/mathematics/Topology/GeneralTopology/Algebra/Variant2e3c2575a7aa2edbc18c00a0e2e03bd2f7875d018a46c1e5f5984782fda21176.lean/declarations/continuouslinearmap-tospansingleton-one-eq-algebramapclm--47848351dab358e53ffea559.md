## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:42ed91dd-af09-3d87-f2a0-496f1055dacd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 98–109.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma ContinuousLinearMap.toSpanSingleton_one_eq_algebraMapCLM :
    toSpanSingleton R (M₁ := A) 1 = algebraMapCLM R A := by
  ext; simp

end

/-- If `R` is a discrete topological ring, then any topological ring `S` which is an `R`-algebra
is also a topological `R`-algebra.

NB: This could be an instance but the signature makes it very expensive in search.
See https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/15339
for the regressions caused by making this an instance. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Algebra/Variant2e3c2575a7aa2edbc18c00a0e2e03bd2f7875d018a46c1e5f5984782fda21176.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Algebra/Variant2e3c2575a7aa2edbc18c00a0e2e03bd2f7875d018a46c1e5f5984782fda21176.lean#L98).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9d3745b7bbdd394222d1b9191d553d646007858d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
