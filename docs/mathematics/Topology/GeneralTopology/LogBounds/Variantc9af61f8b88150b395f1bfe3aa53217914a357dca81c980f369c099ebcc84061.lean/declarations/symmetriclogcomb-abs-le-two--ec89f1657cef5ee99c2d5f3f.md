## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8c375099-39d6-f7ca-9d16-d4aef1fc1f77`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 186–208.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem symmetricLogComb_abs_le_two (t : ℝ) (ht_pos : 0 < t) (ht_lt : t < 1) :
    |symmetricLogComb t| ≤ 2 := by
  have hpos := symmetricLogComb_pos t ht_pos ht_lt
  rw [abs_of_pos hpos]
  exact symmetricLogComb_le_two t ht_pos ht_lt

/-! ## Tighter bounds via alternative form

The symmetric combination can be written as:
  g(t) = log(1-t²) / (log(1+t) · log(1-t))

Key properties:
- g(t) → 1 as t → 0⁺ (removable singularity)
- g(t) is continuous and increasing on (0, 1)
- g(1/2) ≈ 1.024

The PNT+ blueprint claims |g(t)| ≤ log(4/3)/(4/3) ≈ 0.216, but this is
clearly incorrect since g(t) → 1. The correct bound should be around 4/3.

/-! ## Numerical bounds on log values -/

/-- log(3/2) ≥ 2/5. From le_log_one_add_of_nonneg with t = 1/2. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LogBounds/Variantc9af61f8b88150b395f1bfe3aa53217914a357dca81c980f369c099ebcc84061.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LogBounds/Variantc9af61f8b88150b395f1bfe3aa53217914a357dca81c980f369c099ebcc84061.lean#L186).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fc59dbf7f90a4d6c695870594f016290bb019366` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
