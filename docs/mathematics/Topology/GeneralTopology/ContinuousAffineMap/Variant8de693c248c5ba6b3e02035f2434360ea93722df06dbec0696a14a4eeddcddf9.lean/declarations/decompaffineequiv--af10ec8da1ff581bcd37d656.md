## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3681ace49ff646e399b0d3d4f8692cfe54c77f2d1b64cb5511a54e1370bfb5d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 570–575.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def decompAffineEquiv : (V →ᴬ[R] Q) ≃ᵃ[S] Q × (V →L[R] W) where
  __ := decompEquiv R V Q
  linear := decompLinearEquiv R S V W
  map_vadd' _ _ := rfl

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ContinuousAffineMap/Variant8de693c248c5ba6b3e02035f2434360ea93722df06dbec0696a14a4eeddcddf9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ContinuousAffineMap/Variant8de693c248c5ba6b3e02035f2434360ea93722df06dbec0696a14a4eeddcddf9.lean#L570).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e59c21e9dd9c79a6fb746d0cfe6bfb9498a9f9ea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
