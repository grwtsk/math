## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:78d87ef15af24ab64f33b93193766d4a39e5095c4059a1ca2cbf13840a91a70b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 40–53.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ContinuousAffineMap (R : Type*) {V W : Type*} (P Q : Type*) [Ring R] [AddCommGroup V]
  [Module R V] [TopologicalSpace P] [AddTorsor V P] [AddCommGroup W] [Module R W]
  [TopologicalSpace Q] [AddTorsor W Q] extends P →ᵃ[R] Q where
  cont : Continuous toFun

/-- A continuous map of affine spaces. -/
notation:25 P " →ᴬ[" R "] " Q => ContinuousAffineMap R P Q

namespace ContinuousAffineMap

variable {R V W P Q : Type*} [Ring R]
variable [AddCommGroup V] [Module R V] [TopologicalSpace P] [AddTorsor V P]
variable [AddCommGroup W] [Module R W] [TopologicalSpace Q] [AddTorsor W Q]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ContinuousAffineMap/Variantbbef90884ac2b27634d48843811645292ad1f5904aba69b3668e8cb896425452.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ContinuousAffineMap/Variantbbef90884ac2b27634d48843811645292ad1f5904aba69b3668e8cb896425452.lean#L40).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8d0faccfec6f722538b70738c150dedd538c6c98` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
