## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c8201d4a-993d-0a1c-4ae1-c73d68139a6a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 186–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_JD {P : Params} (hP : P.Valid) :
    Tendsto (fun T => 2 / P.L T ^ 3 * ∫ y in (0:ℝ)..(P.L T), (P.localFunD T).g y * y) atTop
      (𝓝 (jStar P.lam)) := by
  apply tendsto_of_close hP.lam_pos (C := 16)
  filter_upwards [(Assembly.tendsto_L_atTop P hP.lam_pos).eventually_ge_atTop (8 * P.w)]
    with T hT
  exact jD_close hP.taper hP.lam_pos hP.lam_le_one hP.one_le_w hT

/-- generic ratio limit: any λ₁-like sequence tending to λ and any data tending to the starred
moments give cRatio → c*_λ. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Limit/Variant62ef088d979646e908ad6ca68ac3802910e766f2db39b4d29d17c7f30568edb6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Limit/Variant62ef088d979646e908ad6ca68ac3802910e766f2db39b4d29d17c7f30568edb6.lean#L186).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cda6e857c4519f68e3b0b8316424556232e98b76` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
