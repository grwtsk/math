## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ec2ec55d-39c2-c4e1-88f9-140393cbef91`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 201–205.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_nhds_unique_of_frequently_eq [T2Space X] {f g : Y → X} {l : Filter Y} {a b : X}
    (ha : Tendsto f l (𝓝 a)) (hb : Tendsto g l (𝓝 b)) (hfg : ∃ᶠ x in l, f x = g x) : a = b :=
  have : ∃ᶠ z : X × X in 𝓝 (a, b), z.1 = z.2 := (ha.prodMk_nhds hb).frequently hfg
  not_not.1 fun hne => this (isClosed_diagonal.isOpen_compl.mem_nhds hne)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hausdorff/Variant25107a08ef2506d126bcf05f4d0ce33c0fe48efc6c0bdedd585c743e2950dfe1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hausdorff/Variant25107a08ef2506d126bcf05f4d0ce33c0fe48efc6c0bdedd585c743e2950dfe1.lean#L201).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ddf72e60d14630eb308d655c326bf191e5bdd935` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
