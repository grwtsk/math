## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:68de0e33d0beba532c2c87f5a47f109f156d0cb39abb577cd6040c97a497b043`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 688–702.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def valueGroupOrderIso :
    ValueGroup₀ (.ofClass (valuation K v)) ≃*o
      ValueGroup₀ (.ofClass (Valued.v : Valuation (v.valuation K).Completion ℤᵐ⁰)) where
  toFun := WithZero.map' (valueGroupEquiv K v)
  invFun := WithZero.map' (valueGroupEquiv K v).symm
  left_inv x := by match x with | 0 => simp | .coe a => simp
  right_inv y := by match y with | 0 => simp | .coe b => simp
  map_mul' := by simp
  map_le_map_iff' {a b} := by
    match a, b with
    | 0, 0 => simp
    | 0, .coe _ => simp
    | .coe _, 0 => simp
    | .coe a, .coe b => simp [← Subtype.coe_le_coe]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/AdicValuation/Variant22f9209d1ee533b59045033547640d3e5bc7e3454086b6f346c34783727b3385.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/AdicValuation/Variant22f9209d1ee533b59045033547640d3e5bc7e3454086b6f346c34783727b3385.lean#L688).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fc35879c144dcdc3a6ac3ea530c5869201a11449` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
