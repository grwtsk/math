## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7fe13169-0265-de68-31eb-2aa314a983c5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–168.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma tendsto_mul_right_of_forall_nonneg_tendsto {l : Filter A}
    (h : ∀ m, 0 ≤ m → ‖m‖ < 1 → Tendsto (· * m) l (𝓝 m)) (m : A) :
    Tendsto (· * m) l (𝓝 m) := by
  obtain ⟨n, c, x, rfl⟩ := mem_span_set'.mp <| by
    show m ∈ span ℂ ({x | 0 ≤ x} ∩ ball 0 1)
    simp [span_nonneg_inter_unitBall]
  simp_rw [Finset.mul_sum]
  refine tendsto_finset_sum _ fun i _ ↦ ?_
  simp_rw [mul_smul_comm]
  exact tendsto_const_nhds.smul <| h (x i) (x i).2.1 <| by simpa using (x i).2.2

omit [PartialOrder A] in
/-- Multiplication on the left by `m` tends to `𝓝 m` if and only if multiplication on the right
does, provided the elements are eventually selfadjoint along the filter `l`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ApproximateUnit/Variantdd3923fee0e069428be62fbf81bacbe6fec1565d0860f2c030c688cf03eddc0a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ApproximateUnit/Variantdd3923fee0e069428be62fbf81bacbe6fec1565d0860f2c030c688cf03eddc0a.lean#L155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a7079e5c938c4b3f83afc3f8d2e98f25bc8623d3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
