## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cd3dddbb-e7e5-5209-9097-82d11a1c9b59`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 228–235.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma hasBasis_approximateUnit :
    (approximateUnit A).HasBasis (fun x : A ↦ 0 ≤ x ∧ ‖x‖ < 1) ({x | · ≤ x} ∩ closedBall 0 1) :=
  isBasis_nonneg_sections A |>.hasBasis.inf_principal (closedBall 0 1)

/-- This is a common reasoning sequence in C⋆-algebra theory. If `0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1`, then the norm of
`z - y * z` is controlled by the norm of `star z * (1 - x) * z`, which is advantageous because the
latter is nonnegative. This is a key step in establishing the existence of an increasing approximate
unit in general C⋆-algebras. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ApproximateUnit/Variant3d7a22c6a8123b5c3835b0839c71908c49901f45c77fb9f8818b0857afda35d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ApproximateUnit/Variant3d7a22c6a8123b5c3835b0839c71908c49901f45c77fb9f8818b0857afda35d7.lean#L228).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ea918994fce91465b3822c97a0f2af0e641f63cc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
