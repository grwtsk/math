## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c2680cf-03f3-1952-4fae-baf71c82dbbe`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_forall_closedBall_subset_aux₂ (y : X) :
    Convex ℝ
      (Ioi (0 : ℝ) ∩ ENNReal.ofReal ⁻¹' ⋂ (i) (_ : y ∈ K i), { r | closedBall y r ⊆ U i }) :=
  (convex_Ioi _).inter <| OrdConnected.convex <| OrdConnected.preimage_ennreal_ofReal <|
    ordConnected_iInter fun i => ordConnected_iInter fun (_ : y ∈ K i) =>
      ordConnected_setOf_closedBall_subset y (U i)

/-- Let `X` be an extended metric space. Let `K : ι → Set X` be a locally finite family of closed
sets, let `U : ι → Set X` be a family of open sets such that `K i ⊆ U i` for all `i`. Then there
exists a positive continuous function `δ : C(X, ℝ)` such that for any `i` and `x ∈ K i`,
we have `EMetric.closedBall x (ENNReal.ofReal (δ x)) ⊆ U i`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/PartitionOfUnity/Variantacbbac260b9b4d19b0e78518ada31a9579ae33730fe2d6f6581aa97db1eb676d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PartitionOfUnity/Variantacbbac260b9b4d19b0e78518ada31a9579ae33730fe2d6f6581aa97db1eb676d.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `da36bee30beecf91a724bedb4aa027c907689d2d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
