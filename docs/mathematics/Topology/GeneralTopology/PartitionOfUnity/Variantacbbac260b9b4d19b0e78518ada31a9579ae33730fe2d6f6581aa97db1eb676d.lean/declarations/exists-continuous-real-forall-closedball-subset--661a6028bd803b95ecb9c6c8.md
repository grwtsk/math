## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0e26fea5-ac8c-e0c9-5b1e-d9b7ff49b48e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 142–148.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_continuous_real_forall_closedBall_subset (hK : ∀ i, IsClosed (K i))
    (hU : ∀ i, IsOpen (U i)) (hKU : ∀ i, K i ⊆ U i) (hfin : LocallyFinite K) :
    ∃ δ : C(X, ℝ), (∀ x, 0 < δ x) ∧ ∀ (i), ∀ x ∈ K i, closedBall x (δ x) ⊆ U i :=
  let ⟨δ, hδ₀, hδ⟩ := exists_continuous_nnreal_forall_closedBall_subset hK hU hKU hfin
  ⟨ContinuousMap.comp ⟨Coe.coe, NNReal.continuous_coe⟩ δ, hδ₀, hδ⟩

end Metric
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/PartitionOfUnity/Variantacbbac260b9b4d19b0e78518ada31a9579ae33730fe2d6f6581aa97db1eb676d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PartitionOfUnity/Variantacbbac260b9b4d19b0e78518ada31a9579ae33730fe2d6f6581aa97db1eb676d.lean#L142).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `da36bee30beecf91a724bedb4aa027c907689d2d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
