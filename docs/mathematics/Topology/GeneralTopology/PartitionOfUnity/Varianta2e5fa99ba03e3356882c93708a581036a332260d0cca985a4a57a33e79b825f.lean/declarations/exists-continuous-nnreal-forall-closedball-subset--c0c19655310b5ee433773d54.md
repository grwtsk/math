## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:81aa51e7-b88d-48cd-c741-ff13f72c1e7e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 132–143.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_continuous_nnreal_forall_closedBall_subset (hK : ∀ i, IsClosed (K i))
    (hU : ∀ i, IsOpen (U i)) (hKU : ∀ i, K i ⊆ U i) (hfin : LocallyFinite K) :
    ∃ δ : C(X, ℝ≥0), (∀ x, 0 < δ x) ∧ ∀ (i), ∀ x ∈ K i, closedBall x (δ x) ⊆ U i := by
  rcases Metric.exists_continuous_nnreal_forall_closedEBall_subset hK hU hKU hfin with ⟨δ, hδ0, hδ⟩
  refine ⟨δ, hδ0, fun i x hx => ?_⟩
  rw [← Metric.closedEBall_coe]
  exact hδ i x hx

/-- Let `X` be a metric space. Let `K : ι → Set X` be a locally finite family of closed sets, let
`U : ι → Set X` be a family of open sets such that `K i ⊆ U i` for all `i`. Then there exists a
positive continuous function `δ : C(X, ℝ)` such that for any `i` and `x ∈ K i`, we have
`Metric.closedBall x (δ x) ⊆ U i`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/PartitionOfUnity/Varianta2e5fa99ba03e3356882c93708a581036a332260d0cca985a4a57a33e79b825f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PartitionOfUnity/Varianta2e5fa99ba03e3356882c93708a581036a332260d0cca985a4a57a33e79b825f.lean#L132).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0fac796cd9becb3d3d6cdb01721b988d9f69c05a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
