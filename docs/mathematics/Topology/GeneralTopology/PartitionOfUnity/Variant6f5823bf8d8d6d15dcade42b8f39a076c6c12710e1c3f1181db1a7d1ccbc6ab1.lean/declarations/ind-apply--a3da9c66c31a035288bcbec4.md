## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b6bca322-4b03-99a8-c2b9-7149e93dee0a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 361–374.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ind_apply (x : X) (hx : x ∈ s) : f (f.ind x hx) x = 1 :=
  (f.eventuallyEq_one x hx).eq_of_nhds
#align bump_covering.ind_apply BumpCovering.ind_apply

/-- Partition of unity defined by a `BumpCovering`. We use this auxiliary definition to prove some
properties of the new family of functions before bundling it into a `PartitionOfUnity`. Do not use
this definition, use `BumpCovering.toPartitionOfUnity` instead.

The partition of unity is given by the formula `g i x = f i x * ∏ᶠ j < i, (1 - f j x)`. In other
words, `g i x = ∏ᶠ j < i, (1 - f j x) - ∏ᶠ j ≤ i, (1 - f j x)`, so
`∑ᶠ i, g i x = 1 - ∏ᶠ j, (1 - f j x)`. If `x ∈ s`, then one of `f j x` equals one, hence the product
of `1 - f j x` vanishes, and `∑ᶠ i, g i x = 1`.

In order to avoid an assumption `LinearOrder ι`, we use `WellOrderingRel` instead of `(<)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/PartitionOfUnity/Variant6f5823bf8d8d6d15dcade42b8f39a076c6c12710e1c3f1181db1a7d1ccbc6ab1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PartitionOfUnity/Variant6f5823bf8d8d6d15dcade42b8f39a076c6c12710e1c3f1181db1a7d1ccbc6ab1.lean#L361).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d6e5fd80f460446bcf1d4859bcbae0b052c2d564` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
