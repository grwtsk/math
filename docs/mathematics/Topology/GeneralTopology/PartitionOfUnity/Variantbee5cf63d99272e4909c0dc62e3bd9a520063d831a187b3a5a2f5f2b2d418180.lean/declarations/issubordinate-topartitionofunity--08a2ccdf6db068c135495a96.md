## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:91bc20b6-1aa9-0362-f27d-70f768ad6d5e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 609–618.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsSubordinate.toPartitionOfUnity {f : BumpCovering ι X s} {U : ι → Set X}
    (h : f.IsSubordinate U) : f.toPartitionOfUnity.IsSubordinate U :=
  fun i => Subset.trans (closure_mono <| f.support_toPartitionOfUnity_subset i) (h i)

end BumpCovering

namespace PartitionOfUnity

variable {s : Set X}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/PartitionOfUnity/Variantbee5cf63d99272e4909c0dc62e3bd9a520063d831a187b3a5a2f5f2b2d418180.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PartitionOfUnity/Variantbee5cf63d99272e4909c0dc62e3bd9a520063d831a187b3a5a2f5f2b2d418180.lean#L609).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6e3294a9d2321c4e9ba1ce3c497bd285b98207c0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
