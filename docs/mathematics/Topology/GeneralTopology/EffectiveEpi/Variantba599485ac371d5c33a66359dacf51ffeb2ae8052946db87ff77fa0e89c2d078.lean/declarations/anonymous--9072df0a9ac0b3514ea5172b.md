## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:049764fd0cc31314a018c99c53ab3266235663b0a9836289119a602bda6e84d0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 115–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ι : (QB π) ≅ B :=
  haveI : IsIso (ιHom π) := by
    apply isIso_of_bijective
    refine ⟨ιFun_injective _, ?_⟩
    intro b
    obtain ⟨a,x,h⟩ := surj b
    refine ⟨Quotient.mk _ ⟨a,x⟩, h⟩
  asIso (ιHom π)

/--
Implementation: The family of morphisms `X a ⟶ QB` which will be shown to be effective epi.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/EffectiveEpi/Variantba599485ac371d5c33a66359dacf51ffeb2ae8052946db87ff77fa0e89c2d078.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/EffectiveEpi/Variantba599485ac371d5c33a66359dacf51ffeb2ae8052946db87ff77fa0e89c2d078.lean#L115).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a7ae75d9d20239e8a93e99ff5473e38fa61b2280` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
