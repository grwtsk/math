## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5f4b5436-e3c0-db2a-4664-2665e5b1c68d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 82–100.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem effectiveEpiFamily_tfae
    {α : Type} [Finite α] {B : Profinite.{u}}
    (X : α → Profinite.{u}) (π : (a : α) → (X a ⟶ B)) :
    TFAE
    [ EffectiveEpiFamily X π
    , Epi (Sigma.desc π)
    , ∀ b : B, ∃ (a : α) (x : X a), π a x = b
    ] := by
  tfae_have 2 → 1
  | _ => by
    simpa [← effectiveEpi_desc_iff_effectiveEpiFamily, (effectiveEpi_tfae (Sigma.desc π)).out 1 2]
  tfae_have 1 → 2 := fun _ ↦ inferInstance
  tfae_have 3 ↔ 1 := by
    erw [((CompHaus.effectiveEpiFamily_tfae
      (fun a ↦ profiniteToCompHaus.obj (X a)) (fun a ↦ profiniteToCompHaus.map (π a))).out 3 1 :)]
    exact ⟨fun h ↦ profiniteToCompHaus.finite_effectiveEpiFamily_of_map _ _ h,
      fun _ ↦ inferInstance⟩
  tfae_finish

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/EffectiveEpi/Variant2f99aef0c6ff047a4e2d3ab4d38181344b1c7305e36cbb425e560b95c49efa4d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/EffectiveEpi/Variant2f99aef0c6ff047a4e2d3ab4d38181344b1c7305e36cbb425e560b95c49efa4d.lean#L82).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f6d4740725d5c24199142c235cd26a7e22952bc8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
