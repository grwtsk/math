## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:794e0859d89b670d95543abf3b62c1a3de5f5024464e7fba9c7c59712c27a0db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 804–809.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def Phi_lambda (lam ε : ℝ) (z : ℂ) : ℂ :=
  Phi_circ |lam| ε ((Real.sign lam : ℂ) * z) +
    (Real.sign lam : ℂ) * (Real.sign z.re : ℂ) * Phi_star |lam| ε ((Real.sign lam : ℂ) * z)

/-- The conjugate-symmetry (Schwarz reflection) condition `F(s̄) = conj (F s)` assumed of `F` in
Proposition 5.2; it makes the derived odd part `G⋆` satisfy `ConjAntisymm`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CH2/Variantd4b919ae4dafad6254279ca2f203843324e083d2ad62a20fbf115733a83b4863.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CH2/Variantd4b919ae4dafad6254279ca2f203843324e083d2ad62a20fbf115733a83b4863.lean#L804).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `abb4d988df589a463537396a6ba3fbd5ac54f13b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
