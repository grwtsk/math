## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9ed04d4d-1181-33c4-7a59-60092d622b1c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 213–224.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma LadderParams.one_add_I_mul_delta_mem_admissible_contour (l : LadderParams) :
    (1 + Complex.I * (l.δ : ℂ)) ∈ l.admissible_contour := by
  have hre : (1 + Complex.I * (l.δ : ℂ)).re = 1 := by simp
  have him : (1 + Complex.I * (l.δ : ℂ)).im = l.δ := by simp
  simp only [LadderParams.admissible_contour, Set.mem_setOf_eq]
  exact Or.inl ⟨le_of_eq hre, him⟩

/-! The rectangle, ladder and boundary are symmetric about the real axis (closed under complex
conjugation), since their definitions only constrain `z.re` and `|z.im|`. This is what makes the
paper's conjugate contour `C̄` and the conjugate-pairing of poles available. -/

/-- The rectangle `R` is invariant under conjugation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CH2/Variantd4b919ae4dafad6254279ca2f203843324e083d2ad62a20fbf115733a83b4863.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CH2/Variantd4b919ae4dafad6254279ca2f203843324e083d2ad62a20fbf115733a83b4863.lean#L213).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `abb4d988df589a463537396a6ba3fbd5ac54f13b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
