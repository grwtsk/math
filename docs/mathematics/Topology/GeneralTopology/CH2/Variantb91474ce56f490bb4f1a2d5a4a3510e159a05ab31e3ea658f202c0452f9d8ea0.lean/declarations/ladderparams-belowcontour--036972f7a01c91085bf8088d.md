## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5268b8590a13de6d4393c6eec8aa5442dab19079cb36b561e4856fcdf838e578`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 147–151.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def LadderParams.belowContour (l : LadderParams) : Set ℂ := {z | z.re < 1 ∧ z.im ∈ Set.Ioo 0 l.δ}

/-- Describes the property that `f` has no poles strictly between the contour and the real axis,
i.e. no poles in `belowContour`. Together with the paper's convention that real poles lie below the
contour, this expresses that every pole `ρ` with `ℑρ > 0` lies on or above the contour. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CH2/Variantb91474ce56f490bb4f1a2d5a4a3510e159a05ab31e3ea658f202c0452f9d8ea0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CH2/Variantb91474ce56f490bb4f1a2d5a4a3510e159a05ab31e3ea658f202c0452f9d8ea0.lean#L147).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `39e6e6fe603b42bd8f7af06c3bdf9e43a667fe84` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
