## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6bda13bd832a715c1eb2d48186e12825919a3ddefa1916f60f1b900dd418745b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 455–477.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def LadderParams.IntegrableOnCn1Minus (l : LadderParams) (n : ℕ) (F : ℂ → ℂ) : Prop :=
  IntegrableOnVSeg (l.σ n) (-l.T) (-l.δ) F ∧ IntegrableOnHSeg (-l.δ) (l.σ n) 1 F ∧
    IntegrableOnVSeg 1 (-l.δ) 0 F

/-! ## Residues and sums of residues (Stage 3)

There is no general complex `residue` in Mathlib, so we define the simple-pole residue as a limit
(matching the convention of `Phi_circ.residue`/`Phi_star.residue`), and the sum of residues over a
region as a `tsum`. The `tsum` is robust to the (mathematically delicate) possibility of infinitely
many poles: points of analyticity contribute `0`, and when only finitely many poles lie in the
region the sum collapses to the finite sum of their residues. Summability — i.e. finiteness of the
pole set in the region — is the implicit hypothesis to supply when formalizing Lemma 5.1. -/

/-- **Placeholder definition — valid only for simple poles.** The residue of `f` at `z₀`, defined
as the simple-pole limit `lim_{z → z₀} (z - z₀) · f z` (matching the convention of
`Phi_circ.residue` / `Phi_star.residue`). At a point of analyticity this is `0` and at a simple
pole it is the usual residue, but at a higher-order or essential singularity the limit diverges
and this returns a junk value.

A general complex residue (and the residue theorem) is planned for Mathlib but not yet available,
so results stated in terms of this `residue` are likely **not provable in full generality** with
the current API. This is a deliberate stopgap, to be replaced with the robust notion once the
Mathlib residue-theorem API lands. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CH2/Variantb91474ce56f490bb4f1a2d5a4a3510e159a05ab31e3ea658f202c0452f9d8ea0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CH2/Variantb91474ce56f490bb4f1a2d5a4a3510e159a05ab31e3ea658f202c0452f9d8ea0.lean#L455).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
