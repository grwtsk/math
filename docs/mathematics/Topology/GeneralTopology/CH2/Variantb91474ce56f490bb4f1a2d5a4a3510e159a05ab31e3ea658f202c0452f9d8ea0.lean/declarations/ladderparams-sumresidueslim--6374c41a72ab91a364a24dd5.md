## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:71934d14da0f672dbdab47b44856a3e83c97cd8f07d1b3d9150908fea28bbe5f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 494–500.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def LadderParams.sumResiduesLim (l : LadderParams) (f : ℂ → ℂ) (S : Set ℂ) : ℂ :=
  Filter.limUnder Filter.atTop (fun n ↦ sumResiduesIn f (S ∩ {z | l.σ n < z.re}))

/-- The conjugation-antisymmetry condition `g(s̄) = -\overline{g(s)}`. In Lemma 5.1 this is imposed
on the odd part `G⋆`; it is what makes the integrals over the contour `C` and its conjugate `C̄`
combine into the single `(1/π) ℑ ∫_C G⋆ x^s` term (the integrand `s ↦ G⋆ s * x^s` inherits the
condition since `x` is real). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CH2/Variantb91474ce56f490bb4f1a2d5a4a3510e159a05ab31e3ea658f202c0452f9d8ea0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CH2/Variantb91474ce56f490bb4f1a2d5a4a3510e159a05ab31e3ea658f202c0452f9d8ea0.lean#L494).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `39e6e6fe603b42bd8f7af06c3bdf9e43a667fe84` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
