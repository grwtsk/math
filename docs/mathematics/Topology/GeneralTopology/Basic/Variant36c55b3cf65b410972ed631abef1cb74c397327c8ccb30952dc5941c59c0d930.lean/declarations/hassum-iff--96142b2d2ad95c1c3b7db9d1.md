## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:858696ca-8dfc-a7c1-70e2-bb17df08847d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 549–576.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem hasSum_iff (f : α → 𝕜) (c : 𝕜) :
    HasSum f c L ↔ HasSum (fun x => re (f x)) (re c) L ∧ HasSum (fun x => im (f x)) (im c) L := by
  refine ⟨fun h => ⟨hasSum_re _ h, hasSum_im _ h⟩, ?_⟩
  rintro ⟨h₁, h₂⟩
  simpa only [re_add_im] using
    ((hasSum_ofReal 𝕜).mpr h₁).add (((hasSum_ofReal 𝕜).mpr h₂).mul_right I)

end tsum

end RCLike

namespace Complex

/-!
We have to repeat the lemmas about `RCLike.re` and `RCLike.im` as they are not syntactic
matches for `Complex.re` and `Complex.im`.

We do not have this problem with `ofReal` and `conj`, although we repeat them anyway for
discoverability and to avoid the need to unify `𝕜`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant36c55b3cf65b410972ed631abef1cb74c397327c8ccb30952dc5941c59c0d930.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant36c55b3cf65b410972ed631abef1cb74c397327c8ccb30952dc5941c59c0d930.lean#L549).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `706e8d34ac3d40b14fcf7246d953fd6964408261` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
