## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:46562792-121a-9f74-76f9-3531d639b7e0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 57–68.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma CompactlySupportedContinuousMap.monotone_of_nnreal : Monotone Λ := by
  intro f₁ f₂ h
  obtain ⟨g, hg⟩ := CompactlySupportedContinuousMap.exists_add_of_le h
  rw [← hg]
  simp

end Monotone

/-- Given a positive linear functional `Λ` on continuous compactly supported functions on `X`
with values in `ℝ≥0`, for `K ⊆ X` compact define `λ(K) = inf {Λf | 1≤f on K}`.
When `X` is a locally compact T2 space, this will be shown to be a
content, and will be shown to agree with the Riesz measure on the compact subsets `K ⊆ X`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantfb2a35e61ab3eca2051b14870a5cc9cb7c9a00209017f41e7e48e57abbf6545a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantfb2a35e61ab3eca2051b14870a5cc9cb7c9a00209017f41e7e48e57abbf6545a.lean#L57).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c815a40e88877056dcb31ecbe757ca3bb9b3702f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
