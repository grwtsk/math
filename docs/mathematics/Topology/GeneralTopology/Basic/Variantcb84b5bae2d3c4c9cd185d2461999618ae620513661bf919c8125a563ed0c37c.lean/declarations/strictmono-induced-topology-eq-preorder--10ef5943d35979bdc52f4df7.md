## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d8c33a9d-0ce1-0b13-0308-1c9f2ccfefb4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 235–245.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
nonrec theorem StrictMono.induced_topology_eq_preorder {α β : Type*} [LinearOrder α]
    [LinearOrder β] [t : TopologicalSpace β] [OrderTopology β] {f : α → β}
    (hf : StrictMono f) (hc : OrdConnected (range f)) : t.induced f = Preorder.topology α := by
  refine induced_topology_eq_preorder hf.lt_iff_lt (fun h₁ h₂ => ?_) fun h₁ h₂ => ?_
  · rcases hc.out (mem_range_self _) (mem_range_self _) ⟨not_lt.1 h₂, h₁.le⟩ with ⟨y, rfl⟩
    exact ⟨y, hf.lt_iff_lt.1 h₁, le_rfl⟩
  · rcases hc.out (mem_range_self _) (mem_range_self _) ⟨h₁.le, not_lt.1 h₂⟩ with ⟨y, rfl⟩
    exact ⟨y, hf.lt_iff_lt.1 h₁, le_rfl⟩

/-- A strictly monotone function between linear orders with order topology is a topological
embedding provided that the range of `f` is order-connected. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantcb84b5bae2d3c4c9cd185d2461999618ae620513661bf919c8125a563ed0c37c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantcb84b5bae2d3c4c9cd185d2461999618ae620513661bf919c8125a563ed0c37c.lean#L235).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ebab0ef499c76aefe53ee57a5050f62c02a43f3e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
