## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9943ce5a-2501-4336-3321-f56ac8ea4b8f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 56–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma CompactlySupportedContinuousMap.monotone_of_nonneg {Λ : C_c(X, ℝ) →ₗ[ℝ] ℝ}
    (hΛ : ∀ f, 0 ≤ f → 0 ≤ Λ f) : Monotone Λ := by
  intro f₁ f₂ h
  have : 0 ≤ Λ (f₂ - f₁) := by
    apply hΛ
    intro x
    simp only [coe_zero, Pi.zero_apply, coe_sub, Pi.sub_apply, sub_nonneg]
    exact h x
  calc Λ f₁ ≤ Λ f₁ + Λ (f₂ - f₁) := by exact (le_add_iff_nonneg_right (Λ f₁)).mpr this
  _ =  Λ (f₁ + (f₂ - f₁)) := by exact Eq.symm (LinearMap.map_add Λ f₁ (f₂ - f₁))
  _ = Λ f₂ := by congr; exact add_sub_cancel f₁ f₂

end Monotone

/-- Given a positive linear functional `Λ` on continuous compactly supported functions on `X`
with values in `ℝ≥0`, for `K ⊆ X` compact define `λ(K) = inf {Λf | 1≤f on K}`.
When `X` is a locally compact T2 space, this will be shown to be a
content, and will be shown to agree with the Riesz measure on the compact subsets `K ⊆ X`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variante2e486f746eb55de3d62d03d2ecc3d258afd4dff1dee95f8953df1e709867903.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variante2e486f746eb55de3d62d03d2ecc3d258afd4dff1dee95f8953df1e709867903.lean#L56).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8e6b2056157bf93f9f2185db974c666d91fc8063` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
