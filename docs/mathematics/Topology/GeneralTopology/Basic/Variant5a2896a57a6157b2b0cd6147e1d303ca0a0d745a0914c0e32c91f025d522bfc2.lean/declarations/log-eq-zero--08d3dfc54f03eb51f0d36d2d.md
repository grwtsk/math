## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:82e647ab-5b3c-8f8e-8bb0-fc9dd5e1fa1f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 263–273.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem log_eq_zero {x : ℝ} : log x = 0 ↔ x = 0 ∨ x = 1 ∨ x = -1 := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    rcases lt_trichotomy x 0 with (x_lt_zero | rfl | x_gt_zero)
    · refine Or.inr (Or.inr (neg_eq_iff_eq_neg.mp ?_))
      rw [← log_neg_eq_log x] at h

    · exact Or.inl rfl
    · exact Or.inr (Or.inl (eq_one_of_pos_of_log_eq_zero x_gt_zero h))
  · rintro (rfl | rfl | rfl) <;> simp only [log_one, log_zero, log_neg_eq_log]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant5a2896a57a6157b2b0cd6147e1d303ca0a0d745a0914c0e32c91f025d522bfc2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant5a2896a57a6157b2b0cd6147e1d303ca0a0d745a0914c0e32c91f025d522bfc2.lean#L263).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0609aec2c81511fa8a97900d12906662d74a8868` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
