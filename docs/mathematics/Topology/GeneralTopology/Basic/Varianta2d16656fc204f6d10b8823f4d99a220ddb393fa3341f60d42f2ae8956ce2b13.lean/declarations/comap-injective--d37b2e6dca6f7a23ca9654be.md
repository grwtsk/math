## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2d074793-2f69-7390-ca1f-c9971e94a360`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 523–537.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma comap_injective (f : X → Y) (hf: Continuous f) (hfs : f.Surjective) :
    (comap (Z := Z) f).Injective := by
  intro a b h
  rw [LocallyConstant.ext_iff] at h
  ext y
  obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ := hfs y
  specialize h x
  rwa [coe_comap_apply _ _ hf, coe_comap_apply _ _ hf, hx] at h

end Comap

/-- If a locally constant function factors through an injection, then it factors through a locally
constant function. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Varianta2d16656fc204f6d10b8823f4d99a220ddb393fa3341f60d42f2ae8956ce2b13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Varianta2d16656fc204f6d10b8823f4d99a220ddb393fa3341f60d42f2ae8956ce2b13.lean#L523).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
