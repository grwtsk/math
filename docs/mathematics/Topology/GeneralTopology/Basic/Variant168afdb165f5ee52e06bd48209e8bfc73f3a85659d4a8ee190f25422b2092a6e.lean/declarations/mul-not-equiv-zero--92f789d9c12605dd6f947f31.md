## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2bc29651-d189-11fd-240b-fc562ef1d94e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 473–490.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mul_not_equiv_zero {f g : CauSeq _ abv} (hf : ¬f ≈ 0) (hg : ¬g ≈ 0) : ¬f * g ≈ 0 :=
  fun (this : LimZero (f * g - 0)) => by
  have hlz : LimZero (f * g) := by simpa
  have hf' : ¬LimZero f := by simpa using show ¬LimZero (f - 0) from hf
  have hg' : ¬LimZero g := by simpa using show ¬LimZero (g - 0) from hg
  rcases abv_pos_of_not_limZero hf' with ⟨a1, ha1, N1, hN1⟩
  rcases abv_pos_of_not_limZero hg' with ⟨a2, ha2, N2, hN2⟩
  have : 0 < a1 * a2 := mul_pos ha1 ha2
  obtain ⟨N, hN⟩ := hlz _ this
  let i := max N (max N1 N2)
  have hN' := hN i (le_max_left _ _)
  have hN1' := hN1 i (le_trans (le_max_left _ _) (le_max_right _ _))
  have hN1' := hN2 i (le_trans (le_max_right _ _) (le_max_right _ _))
  apply not_le_of_lt hN'
  change _ ≤ abv (_ * _)
  rw [abv_mul abv]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant168afdb165f5ee52e06bd48209e8bfc73f3a85659d4a8ee190f25422b2092a6e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant168afdb165f5ee52e06bd48209e8bfc73f3a85659d4a8ee190f25422b2092a6e.lean#L473).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4bb9b5b0db3a0ea03633e1ec0f31c637deec59f2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
