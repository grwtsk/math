## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8c23ffb2d3b1e1a4e46c77e640a21cb0505e69173d8324e20b1316210823df65`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 126–134.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev nonUnitalCommSemiringTopologicalClosure [T2Space R] (s : NonUnitalSubsemiring R)
    (hs : ∀ x y : s, x * y = y * x) : NonUnitalCommSemiring s.topologicalClosure :=
  { NonUnitalSubsemiringClass.toNonUnitalSemiring s.topologicalClosure,
    s.toSubsemigroup.commSemigroupTopologicalClosure hs with }

end NonUnitalSubsemiring

variable [TopologicalSpace R] [Semiring R] [IsTopologicalSemiring R]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant5af0e6f6a37d79dc776ba3b1c6c8273fee1c8b4586525c279750db787f6f64fa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant5af0e6f6a37d79dc776ba3b1c6c8273fee1c8b4586525c279750db787f6f64fa.lean#L126).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
