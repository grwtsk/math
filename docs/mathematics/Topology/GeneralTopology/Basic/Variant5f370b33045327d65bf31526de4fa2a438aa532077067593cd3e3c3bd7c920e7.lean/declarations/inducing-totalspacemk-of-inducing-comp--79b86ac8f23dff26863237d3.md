## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bfa91dbf-7389-5d2a-d0a0-3ad1ef1718cf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 799–814.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem inducing_totalSpaceMk_of_inducing_comp (b : B)
    (h : IsInducing (a.pretrivializationAt b ∘ TotalSpace.mk b)) :
    @IsInducing _ _ _ a.totalSpaceTopology (TotalSpace.mk b) := by
  letI := a.totalSpaceTopology
  rw [← restrict_comp_codRestrict (a.mem_pretrivializationAt_source b)] at h
  apply IsInducing.of_codRestrict (a.mem_pretrivializationAt_source b)
  refine h.of_comp ?_ (continuousOn_iff_continuous_restrict.mp
    (a.trivializationOfMemPretrivializationAtlas (a.pretrivialization_mem_atlas b)).continuousOn)
  exact (a.continuous_totalSpaceMk b).codRestrict (a.mem_pretrivializationAt_source b)

/-- Make a `FiberBundle` from a `FiberPrebundle`.  Concretely this means
that, given a `FiberPrebundle` structure for a sigma-type `E` -- which consists of a
number of "pretrivializations" identifying parts of `E` with product spaces `U × F` -- one
establishes that for the topology constructed on the sigma-type using
`FiberPrebundle.totalSpaceTopology`, these "pretrivializations" are actually
"trivializations" (i.e., homeomorphisms with respect to the constructed topology). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant5f370b33045327d65bf31526de4fa2a438aa532077067593cd3e3c3bd7c920e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant5f370b33045327d65bf31526de4fa2a438aa532077067593cd3e3c3bd7c920e7.lean#L799).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `34f734bf8c82a2c5da569b500ff6e1956cc31e9d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
