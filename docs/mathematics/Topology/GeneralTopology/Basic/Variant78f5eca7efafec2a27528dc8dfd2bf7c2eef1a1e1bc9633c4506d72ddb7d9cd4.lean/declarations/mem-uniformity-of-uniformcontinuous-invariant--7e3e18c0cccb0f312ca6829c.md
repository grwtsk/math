## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:064f67bb-aca8-d0af-fc5d-336a26b5da95`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 784–792.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_uniformity_of_uniformContinuous_invariant [UniformSpace α] [UniformSpace β]
    {s : SetRel β β} {f : α → α → β} (hf : UniformContinuous fun p : α × α => f p.1 p.2)
    (hs : s ∈ 𝓤 β) : ∃ u ∈ 𝓤 α, ∀ a b c, (a, b) ∈ u → (f a c, f b c) ∈ s := by
  rw [UniformContinuous, uniformity_prod_eq_prod, tendsto_map'_iff] at hf

  exact ⟨u, hu, fun a b c hab => @huvt ((_, _), (_, _)) ⟨hab, refl_mem_uniformity hv⟩⟩

/-- An entourage of the diagonal in `α` and an entourage in `β` yield an entourage in `α × β`
once we permute coordinates. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant78f5eca7efafec2a27528dc8dfd2bf7c2eef1a1e1bc9633c4506d72ddb7d9cd4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant78f5eca7efafec2a27528dc8dfd2bf7c2eef1a1e1bc9633c4506d72ddb7d9cd4.lean#L784).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `24e49871f060d354d1fb66058d9e35e6fcce9a4f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
