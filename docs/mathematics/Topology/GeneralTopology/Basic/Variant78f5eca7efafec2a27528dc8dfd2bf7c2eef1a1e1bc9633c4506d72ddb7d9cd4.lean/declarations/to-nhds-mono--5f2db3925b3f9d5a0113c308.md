## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3f47d791-c5c4-74f2-f608-aec1ce83deb2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 485–489.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem to_nhds_mono {u₁ u₂ : UniformSpace α} (h : u₁ ≤ u₂) (a : α) :
    @nhds _ (@UniformSpace.toTopologicalSpace _ u₁) a ≤
      @nhds _ (@UniformSpace.toTopologicalSpace _ u₂) a := by
  rw [@nhds_eq_uniformity α u₁ a, @nhds_eq_uniformity α u₂ a]; exact lift'_mono h le_rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant78f5eca7efafec2a27528dc8dfd2bf7c2eef1a1e1bc9633c4506d72ddb7d9cd4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant78f5eca7efafec2a27528dc8dfd2bf7c2eef1a1e1bc9633c4506d72ddb7d9cd4.lean#L485).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `24e49871f060d354d1fb66058d9e35e6fcce9a4f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
