## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6363bb0b-817d-805b-354b-b158baa373c2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 280–286.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem withBotCoe_inj {I J : WithBot (Box ι)} : (I : Set (ι → ℝ)) = J ↔ I = J := by
  simp only [Subset.antisymm_iff, ← le_antisymm_iff, withBotCoe_subset_iff]

open scoped Classical in
/-- Make a `WithBot (Box ι)` from a pair of corners `l u : ι → ℝ`. If `l i < u i` for all `i`,
then the result is `⟨l, u, _⟩ : Box ι`, otherwise it is `⊥`. In any case, the result interpreted
as a set in `ι → ℝ` is the set `{x : ι → ℝ | ∀ i, x i ∈ Ioc (l i) (u i)}`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant0925c33662c51ac6ee04bb76302ea1e56688fe0b77f8d67a91e9916383de4e81.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant0925c33662c51ac6ee04bb76302ea1e56688fe0b77f8d67a91e9916383de4e81.lean#L280).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `db6d2dfe8366005498dd3bb04658b921a09c1a58` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
