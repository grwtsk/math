## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:243e70d4-600c-8bcc-0b08-d24dc87e756c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 450–462.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem distortion_eq_of_sub_eq_div {I J : Box ι} {r : ℝ}
    (h : ∀ i, I.upper i - I.lower i = (J.upper i - J.lower i) / r) :
    distortion I = distortion J := by
  simp only [distortion, nndist_pi_def, Real.nndist_eq', h, map_div₀]
  congr 1 with i
  have : 0 < r := by
    by_contra hr
    have := div_nonpos_of_nonneg_of_nonpos (sub_nonneg.2 <| J.lower_le_upper i) (not_lt.1 hr)
    rw [← h] at this
    exact this.not_lt (sub_pos.2 <| I.lower_lt_upper i)
  have hn0 := (map_ne_zero Real.nnabs).2 this.ne'
  simp_rw [NNReal.finset_sup_div, div_div_div_cancel_right₀ hn0]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant0925c33662c51ac6ee04bb76302ea1e56688fe0b77f8d67a91e9916383de4e81.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant0925c33662c51ac6ee04bb76302ea1e56688fe0b77f8d67a91e9916383de4e81.lean#L450).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `db6d2dfe8366005498dd3bb04658b921a09c1a58` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
