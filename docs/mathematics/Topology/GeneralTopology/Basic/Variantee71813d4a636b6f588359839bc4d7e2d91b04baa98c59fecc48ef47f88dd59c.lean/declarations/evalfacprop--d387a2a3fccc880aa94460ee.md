## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a0d83934-cf88-4699-3ae2-289493b6acfa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 411–418.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem evalFacProp {l : Products I} (J : I → Prop)
    (h : ∀ a, a ∈ l.val → J a) [∀ j, Decidable (J j)] :
    l.eval (π C J) ∘ ProjRestrict C J = l.eval C := by
  ext x
  dsimp only [ProjRestrict, Function.comp_apply]
  rw [Products.eval_eq, Products.eval_eq]
  simp +contextual [h, Proj]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantee71813d4a636b6f588359839bc4d7e2d91b04baa98c59fecc48ef47f88dd59c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantee71813d4a636b6f588359839bc4d7e2d91b04baa98c59fecc48ef47f88dd59c.lean#L411).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5d7bf4d8f6605259eeb0a8b72099922ba045358b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
