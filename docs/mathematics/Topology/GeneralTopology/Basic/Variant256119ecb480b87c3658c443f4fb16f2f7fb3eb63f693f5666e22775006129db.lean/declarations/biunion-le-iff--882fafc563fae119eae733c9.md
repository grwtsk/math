## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0bc4bbb0-b4be-4d3c-d9c5-9eaf316c203c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 490–500.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem biUnion_le_iff {πi : ∀ J, Prepartition J} {π' : Prepartition I} :
    π.biUnion πi ≤ π' ↔ ∀ J ∈ π, πi J ≤ π'.restrict J := by
  constructor <;> intro H J hJ
  · rw [← π.restrict_biUnion πi hJ]
    exact restrict_mono H
  · rw [mem_biUnion] at hJ
    rcases hJ with ⟨J₁, h₁, hJ⟩
    rcases H J₁ h₁ hJ with ⟨J₂, h₂, Hle⟩
    rcases π'.mem_restrict.mp h₂ with ⟨J₃, h₃, H⟩
    exact ⟨J₃, h₃, Hle.trans <| WithBot.coe_le_coe.1 <| H.trans_le inf_le_right⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant256119ecb480b87c3658c443f4fb16f2f7fb3eb63f693f5666e22775006129db.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant256119ecb480b87c3658c443f4fb16f2f7fb3eb63f693f5666e22775006129db.lean#L490).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e1be81b81ab6c388fd903f9c02d7a4554228138b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
