## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:611484a9a14222ff9a5d1a3f92bbe24ce7c5a38c68b824fea621d4d06ca8e63e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 122–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance partialOrder : PartialOrder (Prepartition I) where
  le := (· ≤ ·)
  le_refl _ I hI := ⟨I, hI, le_rfl⟩
  le_trans _ _ _ h₁₂ h₂₃ _ hI₁ :=
    let ⟨_, hI₂, hI₁₂⟩ := h₁₂ hI₁
    let ⟨I₃, hI₃, hI₂₃⟩ := h₂₃ hI₂
    ⟨I₃, hI₃, hI₁₂.trans hI₂₃⟩
  le_antisymm := by
    suffices ∀ {π₁ π₂ : Prepartition I}, π₁ ≤ π₂ → π₂ ≤ π₁ → π₁.boxes ⊆ π₂.boxes from
      fun π₁ π₂ h₁ h₂ => injective_boxes (Subset.antisymm (this h₁ h₂) (this h₂ h₁))
    intro π₁ π₂ h₁ h₂ J hJ
    rcases h₁ hJ with ⟨J', hJ', hle⟩; rcases h₂ hJ' with ⟨J'', hJ'', hle'⟩
    obtain rfl : J = J'' := π₁.eq_of_le hJ hJ'' (hle.trans hle')
    obtain rfl : J' = J := le_antisymm ‹_› ‹_›
    assumption

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant256119ecb480b87c3658c443f4fb16f2f7fb3eb63f693f5666e22775006129db.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant256119ecb480b87c3658c443f4fb16f2f7fb3eb63f693f5666e22775006129db.lean#L122).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e1be81b81ab6c388fd903f9c02d7a4554228138b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
