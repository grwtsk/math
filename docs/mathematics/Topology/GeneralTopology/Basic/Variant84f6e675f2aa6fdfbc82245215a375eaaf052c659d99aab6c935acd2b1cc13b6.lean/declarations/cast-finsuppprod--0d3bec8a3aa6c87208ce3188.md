## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c35fcfe4-dacd-7718-2c97-7d910c0a8ac5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 257–275.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cast_finsuppProd [Field R] [CharZero R] (g : α → M → ℚ) :
    (↑(f.prod g) : R) = f.prod fun a b => ↑(g a b) :=
  cast_prod _ _

end Rat

/-! ### Declarations about `mapDomain` -/


namespace Finsupp

section MapDomain

variable [AddCommMonoid M] {v v₁ v₂ : α →₀ M}

/-- Given `f : α → β` and `x : α →₀ M`, `mapDomain f x : β →₀ M` is the finitely supported function
whose value at `b : β` is the sum of `v a` over all `a : α` such that `f a = b`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant84f6e675f2aa6fdfbc82245215a375eaaf052c659d99aab6c935acd2b1cc13b6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant84f6e675f2aa6fdfbc82245215a375eaaf052c659d99aab6c935acd2b1cc13b6.lean#L257).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fc63bb9f2f6fff6dae45fde191b4f6eac7300595` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
