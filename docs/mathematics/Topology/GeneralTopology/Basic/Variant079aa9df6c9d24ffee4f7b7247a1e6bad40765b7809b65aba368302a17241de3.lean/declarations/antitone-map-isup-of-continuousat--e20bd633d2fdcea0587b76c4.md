## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1f05fc00-24b2-8616-d08d-d84797082c36`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2795–2803.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Antitone.map_iSup_of_continuousAt {ι : Sort*} {f : α → β} {g : ι → α}
    (Cf : ContinuousAt f (iSup g)) (Af : Antitone f) (fbot : f ⊥ = ⊤) :
    f (⨆ i, g i) = ⨅ i, f (g i) :=
  Monotone.map_iSup_of_continuousAt (show ContinuousAt (OrderDual.toDual ∘ f) (iSup g) from Cf) Af
    fbot
#align antitone.map_supr_of_continuous_at Antitone.map_iSup_of_continuousAt

/-- An antitone function `f` sending `top` to `bot` and continuous at the infimum of a set sends
this infimum to the supremum of the image of this set. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant079aa9df6c9d24ffee4f7b7247a1e6bad40765b7809b65aba368302a17241de3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant079aa9df6c9d24ffee4f7b7247a1e6bad40765b7809b65aba368302a17241de3.lean#L2795).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7efd25fe736c11d967d9c8c43876cdde33cbfb01` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
