## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0c50180a-d33c-f921-2dc8-e49789ca02f2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1020–1026.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsCompact.closure_eq_biUnion_closure_singleton {K : Set X} (hK : IsCompact K) :
    closure K = ⋃ x ∈ K, closure {x} := by
  simp only [hK.closure_eq_biUnion_inseparable, ← specializes_iff_inseparable,
    specializes_iff_mem_closure, ofPred_mem_eq]

/-- In an R₁ space, if a compact set `K` is contained in an open set `U`,
then its closure is also contained in `U`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantca2adcd2681284e3e26070195ef55dfd6f6cd59606cbbcea93c03c1a9fc056a4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantca2adcd2681284e3e26070195ef55dfd6f6cd59606cbbcea93c03c1a9fc056a4.lean#L1020).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0c592c2fa323e46713beb19aa30831ced6a00d94` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
