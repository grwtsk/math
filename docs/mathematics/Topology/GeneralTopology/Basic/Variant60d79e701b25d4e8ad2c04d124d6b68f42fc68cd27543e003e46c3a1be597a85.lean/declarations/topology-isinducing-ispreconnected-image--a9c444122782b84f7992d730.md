## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d1ff9182-c4c5-9ad3-8367-288826595ce2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 331–347.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Topology.IsInducing.isPreconnected_image [TopologicalSpace β] {s : Set α} {f : α → β}
    (hf : IsInducing f) : IsPreconnected (f '' s) ↔ IsPreconnected s := by

  rintro u v hu' hv' huv ⟨x, hxs, hxu⟩ ⟨y, hys, hyv⟩

  rcases hf.isOpen_iff.1 hv' with ⟨v, hv, rfl⟩
  replace huv : f '' s ⊆ u ∪ v := by rwa [image_subset_iff]

    ⟨_, ⟨z, hzs, rfl⟩, hzuv⟩
  exact ⟨z, hzs, hzuv⟩

/- TODO: The following lemmas about connection of preimages hold more generally for strict maps
(the quotient and subspace topologies of the image agree) whose fibers are preconnected. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant60d79e701b25d4e8ad2c04d124d6b68f42fc68cd27543e003e46c3a1be597a85.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant60d79e701b25d4e8ad2c04d124d6b68f42fc68cd27543e003e46c3a1be597a85.lean#L331).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `062782cb2b64b817d48591ea305ca2d814831951` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
