## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bad0b13d-67ae-9393-27ef-586b1b3bc867`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1516–1523.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem EventuallyEq.prod_mk {l} {f f' : α → β} (hf : f =ᶠ[l] f') {g g' : α → γ} (hg : g =ᶠ[l] g') :
    (fun x => (f x, g x)) =ᶠ[l] fun x => (f' x, g' x) :=
  hf.mp <|
    hg.mono <| by
      intros
      simp only [*]
#align filter.eventually_eq.prod_mk Filter.EventuallyEq.prod_mk

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantdf759c7a1625b4e0bb93e6b0fdb5275d0833664e09c70453c4b667e229e00fb2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantdf759c7a1625b4e0bb93e6b0fdb5275d0833664e09c70453c4b667e229e00fb2.lean#L1516).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0f10793f23ae104512c0a8fb86ab4625b5eb0aff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
