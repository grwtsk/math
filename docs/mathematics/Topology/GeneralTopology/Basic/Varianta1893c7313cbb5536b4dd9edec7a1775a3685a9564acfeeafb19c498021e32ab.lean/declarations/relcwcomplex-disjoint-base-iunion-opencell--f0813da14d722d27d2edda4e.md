## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ceb68a57-dbc9-43d1-f6ae-0964e8384825`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 402–410.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma RelCWComplex.disjoint_base_iUnion_openCell [RelCWComplex C D] :
    Disjoint D (⋃ (n : ℕ) (j : cell C n), openCell n j) := by
  simp_rw [disjoint_iff_inter_eq_empty, inter_iUnion, iUnion_eq_empty]
  intro n i
  rw [inter_comm, (disjointBase n i).inter_eq]

/-- If for all `m ≤ n` and every `i : cell C m` the intersection `A ∩ closedCell m j` is closed
and `A ∩ D` is closed then `A ∩ cellFrontier (n + 1) j` is closed for every
`j : cell C (n + 1)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Varianta1893c7313cbb5536b4dd9edec7a1775a3685a9564acfeeafb19c498021e32ab.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Varianta1893c7313cbb5536b4dd9edec7a1775a3685a9564acfeeafb19c498021e32ab.lean#L402).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2cc6b3374c97b03c6a56d2c64b8139c81eb7cfbb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
