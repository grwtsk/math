## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dc0f6c36-927a-73f0-5a8d-374bab993ccc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 176–184.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem bound_of_shell_of_continuous (f : MultilinearMap 𝕜 E G) (hfc : Continuous f)
    {ε : ι → ℝ} {C : ℝ} (hε : ∀ i, 0 < ε i) {c : ι → 𝕜} (hc : ∀ i, 1 < ‖c i‖)
    (hf : ∀ m : ∀ i, E i, (∀ i, ε i / ‖c i‖ ≤ ‖m i‖) → (∀ i, ‖m i‖ < ε i) → ‖f m‖ ≤ C * ∏ i, ‖m i‖)
    (m : ∀ i, E i) : ‖f m‖ ≤ C * ∏ i, ‖m i‖ :=
  bound_of_shell_of_norm_map_coord_zero f (norm_map_coord_zero f hfc) hε hc hf m

/-- If a multilinear map in finitely many variables on normed spaces is continuous, then it
satisfies the inequality `‖f m‖ ≤ C * ∏ i, ‖m i‖`, for some `C` which can be chosen to be
positive. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4d04e9347d1041bd154728879a14092443918ca60c43a4ac55d4c0129f01b328.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4d04e9347d1041bd154728879a14092443918ca60c43a4ac55d4c0129f01b328.lean#L176).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `99c54afef0043a93d86986320aa79171a7001433` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
