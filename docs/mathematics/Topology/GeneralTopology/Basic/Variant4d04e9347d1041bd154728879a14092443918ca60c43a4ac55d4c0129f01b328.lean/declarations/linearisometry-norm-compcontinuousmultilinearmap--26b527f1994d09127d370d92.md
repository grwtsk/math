## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:85a5510f-a8df-6d00-667e-ccc64042585d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 935–953.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem LinearIsometry.norm_compContinuousMultilinearMap (g : G →ₗᵢ[𝕜] G')
    (f : ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E G) :
    ‖g.toContinuousLinearMap.compContinuousMultilinearMap f‖ = ‖f‖ := by
  simp only [ContinuousLinearMap.compContinuousMultilinearMap_coe,
    LinearIsometry.coe_toContinuousLinearMap, LinearIsometry.norm_map,
    ContinuousMultilinearMap.norm_def, Function.comp_apply]

open ContinuousMultilinearMap

namespace MultilinearMap

/-- Given a map `f : G →ₗ[𝕜] MultilinearMap 𝕜 E G'` and an estimate
`H : ∀ x m, ‖f x m‖ ≤ C * ‖x‖ * ∏ i, ‖m i‖`, construct a continuous linear
map from `G` to `ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E G'`.

In order to lift, e.g., a map `f : (MultilinearMap 𝕜 E G) →ₗ[𝕜] MultilinearMap 𝕜 E' G'`
to a map `(ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E G) →L[𝕜] ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E' G'`,
one can apply this construction to `f.comp ContinuousMultilinearMap.toMultilinearMapLinear`
which is a linear map from `ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E G` to `MultilinearMap 𝕜 E' G'`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4d04e9347d1041bd154728879a14092443918ca60c43a4ac55d4c0129f01b328.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4d04e9347d1041bd154728879a14092443918ca60c43a4ac55d4c0129f01b328.lean#L935).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `99c54afef0043a93d86986320aa79171a7001433` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
