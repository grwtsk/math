## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8fd13413866b7dc87ac9e32cee8dc94b59407a2f26e64df2c77a50ff8b07df6e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1084–1102.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def compContinuousLinearMapLRight (g : ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E₁ G) :
    ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 (fun i ↦ E i →L[𝕜] E₁ i) (ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E G) :=
  MultilinearMap.mkContinuous
    { toFun := fun f => g.compContinuousLinearMap f
      map_update_add' := by
        intro h f i f₁ f₂
        ext x
        simp only [compContinuousLinearMap_apply, add_apply]
        convert g.map_update_add (fun j ↦ f j (x j)) i (f₁ (x i)) (f₂ (x i)) <;>
          exact apply_update (fun (i : ι) (f : E i →L[𝕜] E₁ i) ↦ f (x i)) f i _ _
      map_update_smul' := by
        intro h f i a f₀
        ext x
        simp only [compContinuousLinearMap_apply, smul_apply]
        convert g.map_update_smul (fun j ↦ f j (x j)) i a (f₀ (x i)) <;>
          exact apply_update (fun (i : ι) (f : E i →L[𝕜] E₁ i) ↦ f (x i)) f i _ _ }
    (‖g‖) (fun f ↦ by simp [norm_compContinuousLinearMap_le])

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4d04e9347d1041bd154728879a14092443918ca60c43a4ac55d4c0129f01b328.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4d04e9347d1041bd154728879a14092443918ca60c43a4ac55d4c0129f01b328.lean#L1084).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `99c54afef0043a93d86986320aa79171a7001433` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
