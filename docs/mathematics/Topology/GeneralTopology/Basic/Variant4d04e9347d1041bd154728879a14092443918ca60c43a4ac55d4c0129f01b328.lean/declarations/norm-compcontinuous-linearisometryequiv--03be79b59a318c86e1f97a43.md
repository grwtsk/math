## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2df8f6f1-5af5-f9ea-8491-f3efc2f4ad4b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1037–1057.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem norm_compContinuous_linearIsometryEquiv (g : ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E₁ G)
    (f : ∀ i, E i ≃ₗᵢ[𝕜] E₁ i) :
    ‖g.compContinuousLinearMap fun i => (f i : E i →L[𝕜] E₁ i)‖ = ‖g‖ := by
  apply le_antisymm (g.norm_compContinuous_linearIsometry_le fun i => (f i).toLinearIsometry)
  have : g = (g.compContinuousLinearMap fun i => (f i : E i →L[𝕜] E₁ i)).compContinuousLinearMap
      fun i => ((f i).symm : E₁ i →L[𝕜] E i) := by
    ext1 m
    simp only [compContinuousLinearMap_apply, LinearIsometryEquiv.coe_coe'',
      LinearIsometryEquiv.apply_symm_apply]
  conv_lhs => rw [this]
  apply (g.compContinuousLinearMap fun i =>
    (f i : E i →L[𝕜] E₁ i)).norm_compContinuous_linearIsometry_le
      fun i => (f i).symm.toLinearIsometry

/-- `ContinuousMultilinearMap.compContinuousLinearMap` as a bundled continuous linear map.
This implementation fixes `f : Π i, E i →L[𝕜] E₁ i`.

Actually, the map is multilinear in `f`,
see `ContinuousMultilinearMap.compContinuousLinearMapContinuousMultilinear`.

For a version fixing `g` and varying `f`, see `compContinuousLinearMapLRight`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4d04e9347d1041bd154728879a14092443918ca60c43a4ac55d4c0129f01b328.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4d04e9347d1041bd154728879a14092443918ca60c43a4ac55d4c0129f01b328.lean#L1037).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `99c54afef0043a93d86986320aa79171a7001433` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
