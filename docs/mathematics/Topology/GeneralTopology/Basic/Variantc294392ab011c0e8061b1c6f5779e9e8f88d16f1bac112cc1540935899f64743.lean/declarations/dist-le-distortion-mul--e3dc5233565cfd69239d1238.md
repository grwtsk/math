## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:787ffbc4-ebdb-57be-d637-704128e8a749`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 529–535.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dist_le_distortion_mul (I : Box ι) (i : ι) :
    dist I.lower I.upper ≤ I.distortion * (I.upper i - I.lower i) := by
  have A : I.lower i - I.upper i < 0 := sub_neg.2 (I.lower_lt_upper i)
  simpa only [← NNReal.coe_le_coe, ← dist_nndist, NNReal.coe_mul, Real.dist_eq, abs_of_neg A,
    neg_sub] using I.nndist_le_distortion_mul i
#align box_integral.box.dist_le_distortion_mul BoxIntegral.Box.dist_le_distortion_mul

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantc294392ab011c0e8061b1c6f5779e9e8f88d16f1bac112cc1540935899f64743.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantc294392ab011c0e8061b1c6f5779e9e8f88d16f1bac112cc1540935899f64743.lean#L529).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4d0401c8feeee1aec4f49e22c2ffde8a8520e9ac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
