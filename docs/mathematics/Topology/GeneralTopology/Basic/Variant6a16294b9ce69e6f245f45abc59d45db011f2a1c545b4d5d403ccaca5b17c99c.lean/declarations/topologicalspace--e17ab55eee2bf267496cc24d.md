## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:235615cb5a4bcbc6ad8a31fc34449528e7f776d1605ad0911390ed73a81e64cb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class TopologicalSpace (X : Type u) where
  /-- A predicate saying that a set is an open set. Use `IsOpen` in the root namespace instead. -/
  protected IsOpen : Set X → Prop
  /-- The set representing the whole space is an open set.
  Use `isOpen_univ` in the root namespace instead. -/
  protected isOpen_univ : IsOpen univ
  /-- The intersection of two open sets is an open set. Use `IsOpen.inter` instead. -/
  protected isOpen_inter : ∀ s t, IsOpen s → IsOpen t → IsOpen (s ∩ t)
  /-- The union of a family of open sets is an open set.
  Use `isOpen_sUnion` in the root namespace instead. -/
  protected isOpen_sUnion : ∀ s, (∀ t ∈ s, IsOpen t) → IsOpen (⋃₀ s)

variable {X : Type u} {Y : Type v}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant6a16294b9ce69e6f245f45abc59d45db011f2a1c545b4d5d403ccaca5b17c99c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant6a16294b9ce69e6f245f45abc59d45db011f2a1c545b4d5d403ccaca5b17c99c.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `326105821a5a8ce5041ccf8dce22779bd55fa923` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
