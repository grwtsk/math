## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2f1f1343-2549-3a4f-48b7-8719b263dc09`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 508–512.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cauchySeq_of_le_geometric_two : CauchySeq f :=
  cauchySeq_of_dist_le_of_summable _ hu₂ <| ⟨_, hasSum_geometric_two' C⟩

/-- If `dist (f n) (f (n+1))` is bounded by `(C / 2) / 2^n`, then the distance from
`f 0` to the limit of `f` is bounded above by `C`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantcbf9b6b47e6ee6b2962fb2f16ba49b7e005e9a93c0adc1244cc770c34f527315.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantcbf9b6b47e6ee6b2962fb2f16ba49b7e005e9a93c0adc1244cc770c34f527315.lean#L508).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e056917bed0090d2909ab8de28047555fd6262b1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
