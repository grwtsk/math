## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b25e79106db804950d04edc316316e91d422cdaa738352b9ca3f88b0bc3369e3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 66–71.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IsMIntegralCurveOn (γ : ℝ → M) (v : (x : M) → TangentSpace% x) (s : Set ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ t ∈ s, HasMFDerivAt[s] γ t ((1 : ℝ →L[ℝ] ℝ).smulRight <| v (γ t))

/-- If `v` is a vector field on `M` and `t₀ : ℝ`, `IsMIntegralCurveAt γ v t₀` means `γ : ℝ → M` is a
local integral curve of `v` in a neighbourhood containing `t₀`. The value of `γ` outside of this
interval is irrelevant and considered junk. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant568bb44836266e25c91bdef8a3b8f88068fb9d0de17a631f1f530f60caa877b0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant568bb44836266e25c91bdef8a3b8f88068fb9d0de17a631f1f530f60caa877b0.lean#L66).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `78f8184a0309abe82486fa25aa9fba7c86ddae1f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
