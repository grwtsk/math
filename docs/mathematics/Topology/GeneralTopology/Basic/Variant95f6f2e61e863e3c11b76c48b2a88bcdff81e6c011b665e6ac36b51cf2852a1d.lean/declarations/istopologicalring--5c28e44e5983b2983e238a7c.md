## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0c68f9f17f7d96ab03a5ec402882413e64f4ee3bb66d44232760aec7e5ba05a3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 61–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class IsTopologicalRing [TopologicalSpace R] [NonUnitalNonAssocRing R] : Prop
    extends IsTopologicalSemiring R, ContinuousNeg R

/-- A semitopological semiring is a semiring `R` where addition is jointly continuous and
multiplication is continuous in each variable separately.
We allow for non-unital and non-associative semirings as well.

The `IsSemitopologicalSemiring` class should *only* be instantiated in the presence of a
`NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring` instance; if there is an instance of `NonUnitalNonAssocRing`,
then `IsSemitopologicalRing` should be used. Note: in the presence of `NonAssocRing`, these classes
are mathematically equivalent (see `IsTopologicalSemiring.continuousNeg_of_mul` or
`IsSemitopologicalSemiring.toIsTopologicalRing`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant95f6f2e61e863e3c11b76c48b2a88bcdff81e6c011b665e6ac36b51cf2852a1d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant95f6f2e61e863e3c11b76c48b2a88bcdff81e6c011b665e6ac36b51cf2852a1d.lean#L61).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `21598006bb253467dc16becd2ab322c5aab3836b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
