## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7c2aaf269f6b4cd2589f48a639a307f967106c23dbe56b2d8206fdd7f4de29ed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 50–58.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class ProperVAdd (G X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace G] [TopologicalSpace X] [AddGroup G]
    [AddAction G X] : Prop where
  /-- Proper group action in the sense of Bourbaki:
  the map `G × X → X × X` is a proper map (see `IsProperMap`). -/
  isProperMap_vadd_pair : IsProperMap (fun gx ↦ (gx.1 +ᵥ gx.2, gx.2) : G × X → X × X)

/-- Proper group action in the sense of Bourbaki:
the map `G × X → X × X` is a proper map (see `IsProperMap`). -/
@[to_additive existing (attr := mk_iff)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant3461230f86c40cc8020b98c71fa306ba5f69c663ae95896402554aedb6c00a48.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant3461230f86c40cc8020b98c71fa306ba5f69c663ae95896402554aedb6c00a48.lean#L50).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3baa7160a63eee1e3ca419dc365ebafa4869d048` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
