## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0ea8a27d95e06ce1cb82a132ad676ee9ad6be61f9983a0f7c976be5577844b27`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 216–224.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def coinduced : TopModuleCat R :=
  letI : TopologicalSpace M := sInf { t | @ContinuousSMul R M _ _ t ∧ @ContinuousAdd M t _ ∧
      ∀ i, (X i).topologicalSpace.coinduced (f i) ≤ t }
  have : ContinuousAdd M := continuousAdd_sInf fun _ hs ↦ hs.2.1
  have : ContinuousSMul R M := continuousSMul_sInf fun _ hs ↦ hs.1
  ↧M

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantcd1041e82c33bb889c23024261b6468e375650065014d041ae14d92c97ec8344.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantcd1041e82c33bb889c23024261b6468e375650065014d041ae14d92c97ec8344.lean#L216).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e32a9367052e84ebe59e0ed1f2da77ed36d16d05` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
