## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4bada4baf2aedfcbc6044745a6f2d0e620c4c178fbd9bb33ab16b783baf55c35`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 192–206.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def presentation (X : CompHaus) : Stonean where
  toTop := (projectivePresentation X).p.1
  prop := by
    refine CompactT2.Projective.extremallyDisconnected
      (@fun Y Z _ _ _ _ _ _ f g hfcont hgcont hgsurj => ?_)
    let g₁ : (CompHaus.of Y) ⟶ (CompHaus.of Z) := CompHausLike.ofHom _ ⟨g, hgcont⟩
    let f₁ : (projectivePresentation X).p ⟶ (CompHaus.of Z) := CompHausLike.ofHom _ ⟨f, hfcont⟩
    have hg₁ : Epi g₁ := (epi_iff_surjective _).2 hgsurj
    refine ⟨Projective.factorThru f₁ g₁, (Projective.factorThru f₁ g₁).hom.2, funext (fun _ => ?_)⟩
    change (Projective.factorThru f₁ g₁ ≫ g₁) _ = f _

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant66be7e153d0032cbecd7f33113376c123925154d68e71c5aaf29df8abd7d4dc8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant66be7e153d0032cbecd7f33113376c123925154d68e71c5aaf29df8abd7d4dc8.lean#L192).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ee7d2be152e0a98236de32759f80dc32363e90b1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
