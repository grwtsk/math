## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7c0e4d23778dd69ddc114dfbb03135095d6888338701c9fc1f267d4dd309c0a7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 988–1006.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def compCLMOfAntilipschitz {K : ℝ≥0} {g : D → E}
    (hg : g.HasTemperateGrowth) (h'g : AntilipschitzWith K g) :
    𝓢(E, F) →L[𝕜] 𝓢(D, F) := by
  refine compCLM 𝕜 hg ⟨1, K * max 1 ‖g 0‖, fun x ↦ ?_⟩
  calc
  ‖x‖ ≤ K * ‖g x - g 0‖ := by
    rw [← dist_zero_right, ← dist_eq_norm]
    apply h'g.le_mul_dist
  _ ≤ K * (‖g x‖ + ‖g 0‖) := by

    simp only [mul_add, add_comm (K * ‖g x‖), pow_one, mul_one, add_le_add_iff_left]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4f45f194e4126584da05c37e9e7a97ac450d59bccc3f084df0e9e67c3e2cb2ef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4f45f194e4126584da05c37e9e7a97ac450d59bccc3f084df0e9e67c3e2cb2ef.lean#L988).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6358790f10f8e7d38ca7415dfb54bbeb81a18baf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
