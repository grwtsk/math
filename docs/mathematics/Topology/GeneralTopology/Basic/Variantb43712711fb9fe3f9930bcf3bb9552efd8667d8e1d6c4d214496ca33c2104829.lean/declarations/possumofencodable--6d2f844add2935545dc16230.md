## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a774889dbea0e2572e49a2e30cdd7a64513bc8fcde69a88d616b16c57d691166`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 476–489.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def posSumOfEncodable {ε : ℝ} (hε : 0 < ε) (ι) [Encodable ι] :
    { ε' : ι → ℝ // (∀ i, 0 < ε' i) ∧ ∃ c, HasSum ε' c ∧ c ≤ ε } := by
  let f n := ε / 2 / 2 ^ n
  have hf : HasSum f ε := hasSum_geometric_two' _
  have f0 : ∀ n, 0 < f n := fun n => div_pos (half_pos hε) (pow_pos zero_lt_two _)
  refine' ⟨f ∘ Encodable.encode, fun i => f0 _, _⟩
  rcases hf.summable.comp_injective (@Encodable.encode_injective ι _) with ⟨c, hg⟩
  refine' ⟨c, hg, hasSum_le_inj _ (@Encodable.encode_injective ι _) _ _ hg hf⟩
  · intro i _
    exact le_of_lt (f0 _)
  · intro n
    exact le_rfl
#align pos_sum_of_encodable posSumOfEncodable

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantb43712711fb9fe3f9930bcf3bb9552efd8667d8e1d6c4d214496ca33c2104829.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantb43712711fb9fe3f9930bcf3bb9552efd8667d8e1d6c4d214496ca33c2104829.lean#L476).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d4d700d75becd50b8155f0085e13ae951929d18c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
