## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bf41dda9-9cbf-c35e-bf08-6bf375393d3f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 250–256.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsCompactOperator.add [ContinuousAdd M₂] {f g : M₁ → M₂} (hf : IsCompactOperator f)
    (hg : IsCompactOperator g) : IsCompactOperator (f + g) :=
  let ⟨A, hA, hAf⟩ := hf
  let ⟨B, hB, hBg⟩ := hg
  ⟨A + B, hA.add hB,
    mem_of_superset (inter_mem hAf hBg) fun _ ⟨hxA, hxB⟩ => Set.add_mem_add hxA hxB⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantf9fe8623683f3615e5d3298472c6d01b6d17f04f887fb4111d3f91527730d194.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantf9fe8623683f3615e5d3298472c6d01b6d17f04f887fb4111d3f91527730d194.lean#L250).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `916f908a70db9327f1f6f7428f680c492bfad09b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
