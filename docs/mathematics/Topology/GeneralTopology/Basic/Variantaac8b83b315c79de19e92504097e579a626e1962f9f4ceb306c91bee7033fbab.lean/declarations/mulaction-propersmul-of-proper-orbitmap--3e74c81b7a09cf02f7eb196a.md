## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:412ef9e5-e9bf-9948-4b88-ba31ae9c01a9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 300–310.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma MulAction.properSMul_of_proper_orbitMap
    [ContinuousSMul G X] [IsTopologicalGroup G] [MulAction.IsPretransitive G X]
    {x : X} (hx : IsProperMap fun g : G ↦ g • x) : ProperSMul G X := by
  constructor
  let f : G × G → G × X := Prod.map id (fun g ↦ g • x)
  have hfsurj : f.Surjective := Function.surjective_id.prodMap (surjective_smul G x)
  refine isProperMap_of_comp_of_surj (by fun_prop) (by fun_prop) ?_ hfsurj
  simpa [Function.comp_def, Prod.map_apply, mul_smul]
    using! (hx.prodMap hx).comp (ProperSMul.isProperMap_smul_pair (G := G))

end
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantaac8b83b315c79de19e92504097e579a626e1962f9f4ceb306c91bee7033fbab.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantaac8b83b315c79de19e92504097e579a626e1962f9f4ceb306c91bee7033fbab.lean#L300).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c34a482cfd6b3439bead60cfde47c446842a781a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
