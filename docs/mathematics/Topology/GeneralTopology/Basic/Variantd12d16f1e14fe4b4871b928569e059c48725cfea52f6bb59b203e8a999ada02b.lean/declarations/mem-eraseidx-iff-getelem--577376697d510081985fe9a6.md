## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fb5c0091-23af-8d11-a49f-dc28b2f9efbd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 199–209.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_eraseIdx_iff_getElem {x : α} :
    ∀ {l} {k}, x ∈ eraseIdx l k ↔ ∃ i h, i ≠ k ∧ l[i]'h = x
  | [], _ => by
    simp only [eraseIdx, not_mem_nil, false_iff]
    rintro ⟨i, h, -⟩
    exact Nat.not_lt_zero _ h
  | a::l, 0 => by simp [mem_iff_getElem, Nat.succ_lt_succ_iff]
  | a::l, k+1 => by
    rw [← Nat.or_exists_add_one]
    simp [mem_eraseIdx_iff_getElem, @eq_comm _ a, Nat.succ_lt_succ_iff]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantd12d16f1e14fe4b4871b928569e059c48725cfea52f6bb59b203e8a999ada02b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantd12d16f1e14fe4b4871b928569e059c48725cfea52f6bb59b203e8a999ada02b.lean#L199).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6ab7e532c8e9810318816e7f88e93a32438a6b6e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
