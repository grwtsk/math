## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1777caed-f593-2a3a-07c8-5256b29ad0b6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 429–476.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

## Relating elements of the well-order `I` with ordinals

We choose a well-ordering on `I`. This amounts to regarding `I` as an ordinal, and as such it
can be regarded as the set of all strictly smaller ordinals, allowing to apply ordinal induction.

### Main definitions

* `ord I i` is the term `i` of `I` regarded as an ordinal.

* `term I ho` is a sufficiently small ordinal regarded as a term of `I`.

* `contained C o` is a predicate saying that `C` is "small" enough in relation to the ordinal `o`
  to satisfy the inductive hypothesis.

* `P I` is the predicate on ordinals about linear independence of good products, which the rest of
  this file is spent on proving by induction.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant42fb559b286f7e58e140d3eef099220abb2d5d7bdbad809128561cf5cea795dc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant42fb559b286f7e58e140d3eef099220abb2d5d7bdbad809128561cf5cea795dc.lean#L429).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8b4928c820efb0d262bba745da216ca269b97e41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
