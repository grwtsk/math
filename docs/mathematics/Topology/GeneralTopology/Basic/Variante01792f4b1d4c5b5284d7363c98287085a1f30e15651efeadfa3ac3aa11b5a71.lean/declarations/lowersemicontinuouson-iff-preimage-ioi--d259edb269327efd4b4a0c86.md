## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f8297edd-2751-3be7-f7ef-ab2d67ca43d8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 194–210.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

variable {ι : Type*} {f : ι → α → β} [Preorder β] {I : Set ι}

/-- Given a family of lower semicontinuous functions `f : ι → α → β` such that
for each `x : α`, there is a choice `M x : ι` such that the maximum value of
evaluation at `x` is achieved by the function `f (M x)`, then the pointwise
maximum of the family `f` is lower semicontinuous.
In the statement we restrict to subsets `I : Set ι` and `s : Set α` for more generality. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variante01792f4b1d4c5b5284d7363c98287085a1f30e15651efeadfa3ac3aa11b5a71.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variante01792f4b1d4c5b5284d7363c98287085a1f30e15651efeadfa3ac3aa11b5a71.lean#L194).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9dab6865cc0f4761ec3cf57c932412e919ca1a50` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
