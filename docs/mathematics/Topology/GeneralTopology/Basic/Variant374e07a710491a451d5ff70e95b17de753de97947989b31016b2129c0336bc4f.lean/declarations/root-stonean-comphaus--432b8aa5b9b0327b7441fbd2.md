## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:daf5bb1ac7fb137f4fbe60c12730bea25ea58e48460ac36d971fe97e713e4762`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 218–233.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
abbrev _root_.Stonean.compHaus (X : Stonean) := Stonean.toCompHaus.obj X

/--
```
               X
               |
              (f)
               |
               \/
  Z ---(e)---> Y
```
If `Z` is a Stonean space, `f : X ⟶ Y` an epi in `CompHaus` and `e : Z ⟶ Y` is arbitrary, then
`lift e f` is a fixed (but arbitrary) lift of `e` to a morphism `Z ⟶ X`. It exists because
`Z` is a projective object in `CompHaus`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant374e07a710491a451d5ff70e95b17de753de97947989b31016b2129c0336bc4f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant374e07a710491a451d5ff70e95b17de753de97947989b31016b2129c0336bc4f.lean#L218).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9bdadd365123e22636f60e93b98594ee94929352` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
