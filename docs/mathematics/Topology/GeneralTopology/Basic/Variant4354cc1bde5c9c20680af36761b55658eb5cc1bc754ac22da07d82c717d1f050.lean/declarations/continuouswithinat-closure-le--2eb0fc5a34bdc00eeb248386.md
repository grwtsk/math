## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8568c948-45c0-db01-7ea0-17a7977f6c58`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 248–256.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContinuousWithinAt.closure_le [TopologicalSpace β] {f g : β → α} {s : Set β} {x : β}
    (hx : x ∈ closure s) (hf : ContinuousWithinAt f s x) (hg : ContinuousWithinAt g s x)
    (h : ∀ y ∈ s, f y ≤ g y) : f x ≤ g x :=
  show (f x, g x) ∈ { p : α × α | p.1 ≤ p.2 } from
    OrderClosedTopology.isClosed_le'.closure_subset ((hf.prod hg).mem_closure hx h)
#align continuous_within_at.closure_le ContinuousWithinAt.closure_le

/-- If `s` is a closed set and two functions `f` and `g` are continuous on `s`,
then the set `{x ∈ s | f x ≤ g x}` is a closed set. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4354cc1bde5c9c20680af36761b55658eb5cc1bc754ac22da07d82c717d1f050.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4354cc1bde5c9c20680af36761b55658eb5cc1bc754ac22da07d82c717d1f050.lean#L248).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `152453ea8caa12862879e967ece65a996e5623c7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
