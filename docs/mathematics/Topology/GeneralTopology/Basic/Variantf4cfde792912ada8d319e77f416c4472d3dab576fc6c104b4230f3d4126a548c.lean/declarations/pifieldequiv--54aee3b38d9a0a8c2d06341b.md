## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:84e0422f1f2051fdfc9f5c6293d6ded56e2ecd3eb7812f3db6a6d9e514c10a86`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 818–834.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def piFieldEquiv : G ≃ₗᵢ[𝕜] ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 (fun _ : ι => 𝕜) G where
  toFun z := ContinuousMultilinearMap.mkPiRing 𝕜 ι z
  invFun f := f fun _ => 1
  map_add' z z' := by
    ext
    simp [smul_add]
  map_smul' c z := by
    ext
    simp [smul_smul, mul_comm]
  left_inv z := by simp
  right_inv f := f.mkPiRing_apply_one_eq_self
  norm_map' := norm_mkPiRing

end ContinuousMultilinearMap

namespace ContinuousLinearMap

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantf4cfde792912ada8d319e77f416c4472d3dab576fc6c104b4230f3d4126a548c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantf4cfde792912ada8d319e77f416c4472d3dab576fc6c104b4230f3d4126a548c.lean#L818).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1aec35bffddaf94f76bbd74293bc89515d4b7b3f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
