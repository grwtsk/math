## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8dd879010b3debace3ed0d2f8f64852f23d3f6d42d7a71d1b86072be534e91a8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 611–708.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    this descends to an antitone neighborhood basis `v` for `𝓝 (1 : G ⧸ N)`. Since `𝓤 (G ⧸ N)` is

/-- The quotient `G ⧸ N` of a complete first countable uniform group `G` by a normal subgroup
is itself complete. In contrast to `QuotientGroup.completeSpace_right'`, in this version `G` is
already equipped with a uniform structure.
[N. Bourbaki, *General Topology*, IX.3.1 Proposition 4][bourbaki1966b]

Even though `G` is equipped with a uniform structure, the quotient `G ⧸ N` does not inherit a
uniform structure, so it is still provided manually via `IsTopologicalGroup.rightUniformSpace`.
In the most common use cases, this coincides (definitionally) with the uniform structure on the
quotient obtained via other means. -/
@[to_additive /-- The quotient `G ⧸ N` of a complete first countable uniform additive group
`G` by a normal additive subgroup is itself complete. Consequently, quotients of Banach spaces by
subspaces are complete. In contrast to `QuotientAddGroup.completeSpace_right'`, in this version
`G` is already equipped with a uniform structure.
[N. Bourbaki, *General Topology*, IX.3.1 Proposition 4][bourbaki1966b]

Even though `G` is equipped with a uniform structure, the quotient `G ⧸ N` does not inherit a
uniform structure, so it is still provided manually via `IsTopologicalAddGroup.rightUniformSpace`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant8a54c95892872d07763bccb96b2023b056d03c2b897cbba8f30ad0eb691509ad.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
