## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:602d9342-2312-8142-fba8-d877229f4d02`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 424–438.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem FiberBundle.isCoveringMap {F : Type*} {E : X → Type*} [TopologicalSpace F]
    [DiscreteTopology F] [TopologicalSpace (Bundle.TotalSpace F E)] [∀ x, TopologicalSpace (E x)]
    [FiberBundle F E] : IsCoveringMap (π F E) :=
  IsFiberBundle.isCoveringMap fun x => ⟨trivializationAt F E x, mem_baseSet_trivializationAt F E x⟩

open Function in
/-- Let `f : E → X` be a (not necessarily continuous) map between topological spaces, and let
`V` be an open subset of `X`. Suppose that there is a family `U` of disjoint subsets of `E`
that covers `f⁻¹(V)` such that for every `i`,

1. `f` is injective on `Uᵢ`,
2. `V` is contained in the image `f(Uᵢ)`,
3. the open sets in `V` are determined by their preimages in `Uᵢ`.

Then `f` admits a `Bundle.Trivialization` over the base set `V`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant85517cbcabc90b4f0a79c8b9c38fc93ea2b1c2927db1d1a23e339bf7f3bfcb32.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant85517cbcabc90b4f0a79c8b9c38fc93ea2b1c2927db1d1a23e339bf7f3bfcb32.lean#L424).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c19662de3e595c9ce71ed4980b9b5d7fe3c51648` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
