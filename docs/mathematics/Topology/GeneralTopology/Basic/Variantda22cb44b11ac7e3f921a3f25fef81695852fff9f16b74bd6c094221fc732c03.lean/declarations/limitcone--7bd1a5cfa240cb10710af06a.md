## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:553a371fcef63961cd019a0fc5db0f63686c044f1d40a6905ced6947529e6083`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 38–52.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def limitCone (F : J ⥤ TopCat.{max v u}) : Cone F where
  pt := TopCat.of { u : ∀ j : J, F.obj j | ∀ {i j : J} (f : i ⟶ j), F.map f (u i) = u j }
  π :=
    { app := fun j => ofHom
        { toFun := fun u => u.val j
          -- Porting note: `continuity` from the original mathlib3 proof failed here.
          continuous_toFun := Continuous.comp (continuous_apply _) (continuous_subtype_val) }
      naturality := fun X Y f => by
        ext a
        exact (a.2 f).symm }

/-- The chosen cone `TopCat.limitCone F` for a functor `F : J ⥤ TopCat` is a limit cone.
Generally you should just use `limit.isLimit F`, unless you need the actual definition
(which is in terms of `Types.limitConeIsLimit`).

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantda22cb44b11ac7e3f921a3f25fef81695852fff9f16b74bd6c094221fc732c03.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantda22cb44b11ac7e3f921a3f25fef81695852fff9f16b74bd6c094221fc732c03.lean#L38).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `57567c77edfdb571376aafcbd9851aa337e34edb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
