## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4f18f55e-7e11-ecee-270f-f01f56564385`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 507–514.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem SuccOrder.hasBasis_nhds_Ioc [OrderTopology α] [SuccOrder α] {a : α} [NoMinOrder α] :
    (𝓝 a).HasBasis (· < a) (Set.Ioc · a) :=
  SuccOrder.hasBasis_nhds_Ioc_of_exists_lt (exists_lt a)

variable (α) in
/-- Let `α` be a densely ordered linear order with order topology. If `α` is a separable space, then
it has second countable topology. Note that the "densely ordered" assumption cannot be dropped, see
[double arrow space](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces/S000093) for a counterexample. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant7abbc2255c0efe89274b440c3401ef7f707e39b498e092152e924dc48d23e639.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant7abbc2255c0efe89274b440c3401ef7f707e39b498e092152e924dc48d23e639.lean#L507).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `55a7510276f30c2bbe70b43993143d137ed0ed25` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
