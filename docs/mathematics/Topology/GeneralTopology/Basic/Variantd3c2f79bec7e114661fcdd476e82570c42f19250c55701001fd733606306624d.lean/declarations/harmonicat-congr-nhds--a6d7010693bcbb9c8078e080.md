## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8965fd01-3348-beb9-1f40-7bb81aa9d3b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 71–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem harmonicAt_congr_nhds {f₁ f₂ : E → F} {x : E} (h : f₁ =ᶠ[𝓝 x] f₂) :
    HarmonicAt f₁ x ↔ HarmonicAt f₂ x := by
  constructor <;> intro hf
  · exact ⟨hf.1.congr_of_eventuallyEq h.symm, (laplacian_congr_nhds h.symm).trans hf.2⟩
  · exact ⟨hf.1.congr_of_eventuallyEq h, (laplacian_congr_nhds h).trans hf.2⟩

/--
If `f` is harmonic at `x`, then it is harmonic at all points in a neighborhood of `x`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantd3c2f79bec7e114661fcdd476e82570c42f19250c55701001fd733606306624d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantd3c2f79bec7e114661fcdd476e82570c42f19250c55701001fd733606306624d.lean#L71).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cdd2ca3e2cf4d7a928e113ea1768e78e9926b6b0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
