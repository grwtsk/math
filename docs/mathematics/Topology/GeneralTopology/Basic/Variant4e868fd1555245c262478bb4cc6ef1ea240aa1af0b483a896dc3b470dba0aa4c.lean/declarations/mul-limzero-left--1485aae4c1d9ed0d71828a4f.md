## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:38c4de55-04da-4e81-851e-61653782700f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 389–395.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mul_limZero_left {f} (g : CauSeq β abv) (hg : LimZero f) : LimZero (f * g)
  | ε, ε0 =>
    let ⟨G, G0, hG⟩ := g.bounded' 0
    (hg _ <| div_pos ε0 G0).imp fun _ H j ij => by
      have := mul_lt_mul'' (H _ ij) (hG j) (abv_nonneg abv _) (abv_nonneg abv _)
      rwa [div_mul_cancel₀ _ (ne_of_gt G0), ← abv_mul] at this

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4e868fd1555245c262478bb4cc6ef1ea240aa1af0b483a896dc3b470dba0aa4c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4e868fd1555245c262478bb4cc6ef1ea240aa1af0b483a896dc3b470dba0aa4c.lean#L389).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb1a85629a9958306a476a1bcc053e1db528ce27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
