## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:103d041f-aeec-c4c2-cebd-8b99f3a8b447`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 712–716.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rat_sup_continuous_lemma {ε : α} {a₁ a₂ b₁ b₂ : α} :
    abs (a₁ - b₁) < ε → abs (a₂ - b₂) < ε → abs (a₁ ⊔ a₂ - b₁ ⊔ b₂) < ε := fun h₁ h₂ =>
  (abs_max_sub_max_le_max _ _ _ _).trans_lt (max_lt h₁ h₂)

-- so named to match `rat_add_continuous_lemma`
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4e868fd1555245c262478bb4cc6ef1ea240aa1af0b483a896dc3b470dba0aa4c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant4e868fd1555245c262478bb4cc6ef1ea240aa1af0b483a896dc3b470dba0aa4c.lean#L712).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb1a85629a9958306a476a1bcc053e1db528ce27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
