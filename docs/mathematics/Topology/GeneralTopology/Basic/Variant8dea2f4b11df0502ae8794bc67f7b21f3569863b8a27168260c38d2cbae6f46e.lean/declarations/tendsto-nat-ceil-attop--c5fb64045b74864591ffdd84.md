## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9d5e5801-55d9-d6b7-8d1d-400853edb974`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 671–676.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma tendsto_nat_ceil_atTop {α : Type*}
    [Semiring α] [LinearOrder α] [IsStrictOrderedRing α] [FloorSemiring α] :
    Tendsto (fun x : α ↦ ⌈x⌉₊) atTop atTop := by
  refine Nat.ceil_mono.tendsto_atTop_atTop (fun x ↦ ⟨x, ?_⟩)
  simp only [Nat.ceil_natCast, le_refl]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant8dea2f4b11df0502ae8794bc67f7b21f3569863b8a27168260c38d2cbae6f46e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant8dea2f4b11df0502ae8794bc67f7b21f3569863b8a27168260c38d2cbae6f46e.lean#L671).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `45d61887e17c52bdaa0091563890dace3d6f25ae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
