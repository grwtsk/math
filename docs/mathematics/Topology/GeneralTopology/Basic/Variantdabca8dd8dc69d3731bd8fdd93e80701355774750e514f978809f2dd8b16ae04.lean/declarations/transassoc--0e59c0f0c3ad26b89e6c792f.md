## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:462b6bc9eb17e8e9c2cddfdf185d6c4f460582f6d555154c0a2c812317bb1b3e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 205–220.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def transAssoc {x₀ x₁ x₂ x₃ : X} (p : Path x₀ x₁) (q : Path x₁ x₂) (r : Path x₂ x₃) :
    Homotopy ((p.trans q).trans r) (p.trans (q.trans r)) :=
  ((Homotopy.reparam (p.trans (q.trans r))
          (fun t => ⟨transAssocReparamAux t, transAssocReparamAux_mem_I t⟩) (by fun_prop)
          (Subtype.ext transAssocReparamAux_zero) (Subtype.ext transAssocReparamAux_one)).cast
      rfl (trans_assoc_reparam p q r).symm).symm

end Assoc

end Homotopy

end Path

subsequently put a `CategoryTheory.Groupoid` structure on it. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantdabca8dd8dc69d3731bd8fdd93e80701355774750e514f978809f2dd8b16ae04.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantdabca8dd8dc69d3731bd8fdd93e80701355774750e514f978809f2dd8b16ae04.lean#L205).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5c862cafeaf6055b73ba26559769ec4f40e1528c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
