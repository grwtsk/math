## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:571092ed-c68b-bf51-9be8-795263249ebd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 504–512.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem edist_le_of_edist_le_geometric_two_of_tendsto (n : ℕ) : edist (f n) a ≤ 2 * C / 2 ^ n := by
  simp only [div_eq_mul_inv, ENNReal.inv_pow] at *
  rw [mul_assoc, mul_comm]
  convert! edist_le_of_edist_le_geometric_of_tendsto 2⁻¹ C hu ha n using 1
  rw [ENNReal.one_sub_inv_two, div_eq_mul_inv, inv_inv]

include hu ha in
/-- If `edist (f n) (f (n+1))` is bounded by `C * 2^-n`, then the distance from
`f 0` to the limit of `f` is bounded above by `2 * C`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant1e5ffe4d209c172d0b23a04704fffcf26a2669f39e7fc71b6cef4587b37058ef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant1e5ffe4d209c172d0b23a04704fffcf26a2669f39e7fc71b6cef4587b37058ef.lean#L504).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f229c808184fe0b2489be8d178257a08b5bbb449` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
