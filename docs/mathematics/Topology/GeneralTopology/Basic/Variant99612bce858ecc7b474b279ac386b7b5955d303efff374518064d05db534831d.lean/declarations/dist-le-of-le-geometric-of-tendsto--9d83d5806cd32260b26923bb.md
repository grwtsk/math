## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a363972a-1a12-174c-c14f-1aea4964524f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 542–555.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dist_le_of_le_geometric_of_tendsto {a : α} (ha : Tendsto f atTop (𝓝 a)) (n : ℕ) :
    dist (f n) a ≤ C * r ^ n / (1 - r) := by
  have := aux_hasSum_of_le_geometric hr hu
  convert! dist_le_tsum_of_dist_le_of_tendsto _ hu ⟨_, this⟩ ha n
  simp only [pow_add, mul_left_comm C, mul_div_right_comm]
  rw [mul_comm]
  exact (this.mul_left _).tsum_eq.symm

end

variable (hu₂ : ∀ n, dist (f n) (f (n + 1)) ≤ C / 2 / 2 ^ n)
include hu₂

/-- If `dist (f n) (f (n+1))` is bounded by `(C / 2) / 2^n`, then `f` is a Cauchy sequence. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant99612bce858ecc7b474b279ac386b7b5955d303efff374518064d05db534831d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant99612bce858ecc7b474b279ac386b7b5955d303efff374518064d05db534831d.lean#L542).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c633976a412c7d498b55d6188e811d005fd73da4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
