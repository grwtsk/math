## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7ee6647c6315fee66321255a75e1228bc26dad8b81345a3fa534b3ebf93c035c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 657–668.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance vectorBundle : VectorBundle R F Z.Fiber where
  trivialization_linear' := by
    rintro _ ⟨i, rfl⟩
    apply localTriv.isLinear
  continuousOn_coordChange' := by
    rintro _ _ ⟨i, rfl⟩ ⟨i', rfl⟩
    refine (Z.continuousOn_coordChange i i').congr fun b hb => ?_
    ext v
    exact Z.localTriv_coordChange_eq i i' hb v

/-- The projection on the base of a vector bundle created from core is continuous -/
@[continuity]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant3a835a9da93c2b8258f1e4a4ad9e489f87ea627f4d08e8b543b16aaf546bc26b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant3a835a9da93c2b8258f1e4a4ad9e489f87ea627f4d08e8b543b16aaf546bc26b.lean#L657).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bdcce71ab4bd64bf7c87dfd0cffc8624d418e43c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
