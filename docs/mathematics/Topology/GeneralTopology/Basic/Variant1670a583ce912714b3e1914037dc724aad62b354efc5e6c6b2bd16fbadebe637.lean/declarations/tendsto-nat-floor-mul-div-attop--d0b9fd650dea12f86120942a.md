## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c2a1800b-ede8-3540-d032-310cb840f8f1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 611–626.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_nat_floor_mul_div_atTop {a : R} (ha : 0 ≤ a) :
    Tendsto (fun x => (⌊a * x⌋₊ : R) / x) atTop (𝓝 a) := by
  have A : Tendsto (fun x : R => a - x⁻¹) atTop (𝓝 (a - 0)) :=
    tendsto_const_nhds.sub tendsto_inv_atTop_zero
  rw [sub_zero] at A
  apply tendsto_of_tendsto_of_tendsto_of_le_of_le' A tendsto_const_nhds
  · refine' eventually_atTop.2 ⟨1, fun x hx => _⟩
    simp only [le_div_iff (zero_lt_one.trans_le hx), _root_.sub_mul,
      inv_mul_cancel (zero_lt_one.trans_le hx).ne']
    have := Nat.lt_floor_add_one (a * x)
    linarith
  · refine' eventually_atTop.2 ⟨1, fun x hx => _⟩
    rw [div_le_iff (zero_lt_one.trans_le hx)]
    simp [Nat.floor_le (mul_nonneg ha (zero_le_one.trans hx))]
#align tendsto_nat_floor_mul_div_at_top tendsto_nat_floor_mul_div_atTop

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant1670a583ce912714b3e1914037dc724aad62b354efc5e6c6b2bd16fbadebe637.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant1670a583ce912714b3e1914037dc724aad62b354efc5e6c6b2bd16fbadebe637.lean#L611).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c902b2b00ec3c528e0f33d8de642fb31f0672aa1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
