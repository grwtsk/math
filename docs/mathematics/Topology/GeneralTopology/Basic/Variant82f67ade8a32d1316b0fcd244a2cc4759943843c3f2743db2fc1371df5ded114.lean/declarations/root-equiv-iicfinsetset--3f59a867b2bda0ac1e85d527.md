## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a5e11071a91f6971a561585db26532b424862a1cce1ec25b315a0bc25923b09b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 471–482.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def _root_.Equiv.IicFinsetSet (a : α) : Iic a ≃ Set.Iic a where
  toFun b := ⟨b.1, coe_Iic a ▸ mem_coe.2 b.2⟩
  invFun b := ⟨b.1, by rw [← mem_coe, coe_Iic a]; exact b.2⟩
  left_inv := fun _ ↦ rfl
  right_inv := fun _ ↦ rfl

end LocallyFiniteOrderBot

section LocallyFiniteOrderTop

variable [LocallyFiniteOrderTop α] {a : α}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant82f67ade8a32d1316b0fcd244a2cc4759943843c3f2743db2fc1371df5ded114.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant82f67ade8a32d1316b0fcd244a2cc4759943843c3f2743db2fc1371df5ded114.lean#L471).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e95ee1379c20d60503ab4563e3c04342a4d274e6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
