## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:10b8c159-5719-ad54-5cd0-03c8715fcb99`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1136–1158.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma transGen_covBy_of_lt [Preorder α] [LocallyFiniteOrder α] {x y : α} (hxy : x < y) :
    TransGen (· ⋖ ·) x y := by
  -- We proceed by well-founded induction on the cardinality of `Ico x y`.
  -- It's impossible for the cardinality to be zero since `x < y`
  -- `Ico x y` is a nonempty finset and so contains a maximal element `z` and
  -- `Ico x z` has cardinality strictly less than the cardinality of `Ico x y`
  obtain ⟨z, hxz, hz⟩ := (Set.finite_Ico x y).exists_le_maximal <| Set.left_mem_Ico.2 hxy
  have z_card : #(Ico x z) < #(Ico x y) := card_lt_card <| ssubset_iff_of_subset
    (Ico_subset_Ico_right hz.1.2.le) |>.mpr ⟨z, mem_Ico.2 hz.1, right_notMem_Ico⟩

  by_cases hxz : x < z
  /- when `x < z`, then we may use the induction hypothesis to get a chain

  /- when `¬ x < z`, then actually `z ≤ x` (not because it's a linear order, but because
  `x ≤ z`), and since `z ⋖ y` we conclude that `x ⋖ y` , then `Relation.TransGen.single`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant82f67ade8a32d1316b0fcd244a2cc4759943843c3f2743db2fc1371df5ded114.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant82f67ade8a32d1316b0fcd244a2cc4759943843c3f2743db2fc1371df5ded114.lean#L1136).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e95ee1379c20d60503ab4563e3c04342a4d274e6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
