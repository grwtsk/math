## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:010830a4102cf560e7384a9089f2d1d8da3894861d1044e6b68f4551b95a44b3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2527–2554.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def finTwoArrow : (Fin 2 → M) ≃L[R] M × M :=
  { piFinTwo R fun _ => M with toLinearEquiv := LinearEquiv.finTwoArrow R M }
#align continuous_linear_equiv.fin_two_arrow ContinuousLinearEquiv.finTwoArrow
#align continuous_linear_equiv.fin_two_arrow_apply ContinuousLinearEquiv.finTwoArrow_apply
#align continuous_linear_equiv.fin_two_arrow_symm_apply ContinuousLinearEquiv.finTwoArrow_symm_apply

end

/-- Introduce a function `inverse` from `M →L[R] M₂` to `M₂ →L[R] M`, which sends `f` to `f.symm` if
`f` is a continuous linear equivalence and to `0` otherwise.  This definition is somewhat ad hoc,
but one needs a fully (rather than partially) defined inverse function for some purposes, including
for calculus. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant95eded680c5b6940ebea9f3a1074a96d30cb32c83e489a95c59df9b30d23c3de.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant95eded680c5b6940ebea9f3a1074a96d30cb32c83e489a95c59df9b30d23c3de.lean#L2527).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `16c6e793ab180ef3c6e77c75e350a7456fd58b09` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
