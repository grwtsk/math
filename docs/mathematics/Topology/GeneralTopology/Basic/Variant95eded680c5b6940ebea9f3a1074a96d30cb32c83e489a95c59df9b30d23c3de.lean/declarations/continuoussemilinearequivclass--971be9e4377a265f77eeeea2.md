## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bb4a417bfbc19244114c80cdc48f20e901e769dd2842589da0e44b408b777203`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 307–322.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class ContinuousSemilinearEquivClass (F : Type*) {R : outParam (Type*)} {S : outParam (Type*)}
    [Semiring R] [Semiring S] (σ : outParam <| R →+* S) {σ' : outParam <| S →+* R}
    [RingHomInvPair σ σ'] [RingHomInvPair σ' σ] (M : outParam (Type*)) [TopologicalSpace M]
    [AddCommMonoid M] (M₂ : outParam (Type*)) [TopologicalSpace M₂] [AddCommMonoid M₂] [Module R M]
    [Module S M₂] extends SemilinearEquivClass F σ M M₂ where
  map_continuous : ∀ f : F, Continuous f := by continuity
  inv_continuous : ∀ f : F, Continuous (inv f) := by continuity
#align continuous_semilinear_equiv_class ContinuousSemilinearEquivClass

attribute [inherit_doc ContinuousSemilinearEquivClass]
ContinuousSemilinearEquivClass.map_continuous
ContinuousSemilinearEquivClass.inv_continuous

/-- `ContinuousLinearEquivClass F σ M M₂` asserts `F` is a type of bundled continuous
`R`-linear equivs `M → M₂`. This is an abbreviation for
`ContinuousSemilinearEquivClass F (RingHom.id R) M M₂`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant95eded680c5b6940ebea9f3a1074a96d30cb32c83e489a95c59df9b30d23c3de.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant95eded680c5b6940ebea9f3a1074a96d30cb32c83e489a95c59df9b30d23c3de.lean#L307).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `16c6e793ab180ef3c6e77c75e350a7456fd58b09` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
