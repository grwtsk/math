## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:896b8866-d658-4d6f-66f1-b4946538ede7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 187–196.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsConnected.biUnion_of_reflTransGen {ι : Type*} {t : Set ι} {s : ι → Set α}
    (ht : t.Nonempty) (H : ∀ i ∈ t, IsConnected (s i))
    (K : ∀ i, i ∈ t → ∀ j, j ∈ t → ReflTransGen (fun i j : ι => (s i ∩ s j).Nonempty ∧ i ∈ t) i j) :
    IsConnected (⋃ n ∈ t, s n) :=
  ⟨nonempty_biUnion.2 <| ⟨ht.some, ht.some_mem, (H _ ht.some_mem).nonempty⟩,
    IsPreconnected.biUnion_of_reflTransGen (fun i hi => (H i hi).isPreconnected) K⟩

/-- Preconnectedness of the iUnion of a family of preconnected sets
indexed by the vertices of a preconnected graph,
where two vertices are joined when the corresponding sets intersect. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant1c4f093897d2ab484bbc6dc9c79a8d3dffb2cb6073033096e11b6a8082d19fd4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant1c4f093897d2ab484bbc6dc9c79a8d3dffb2cb6073033096e11b6a8082d19fd4.lean#L187).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5fa17d82b172a666f3d23997cd0dc5251cd09238` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
