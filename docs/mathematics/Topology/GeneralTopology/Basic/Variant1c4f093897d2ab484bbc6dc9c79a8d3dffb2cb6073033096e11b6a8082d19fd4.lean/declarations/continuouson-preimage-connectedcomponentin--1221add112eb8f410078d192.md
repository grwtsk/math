## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6660fdd4-b837-489f-2a83-e5ccb0805b2e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 686–697.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContinuousOn.preimage_connectedComponentIn [TopologicalSpace β] {f : α → β} {F : Set β}
    (hf : ContinuousOn f (f ⁻¹' F)) (y : β) :
    f ⁻¹' connectedComponentIn F y =
      ⋃ x ∈ f ⁻¹' connectedComponentIn F y, connectedComponentIn (f ⁻¹' F) x := by
  refine subset_antisymm (fun z hz ↦ ?_) (iUnion₂_subset fun x hx z hz ↦ ?_)
  · exact mem_biUnion hz (mem_connectedComponentIn (connectedComponentIn_subset F y hz))
  · rw [mem_preimage, connectedComponentIn_eq hx]
    exact connectedComponentIn_mono _ (image_preimage_subset f F)
      (hf.mapsTo_connectedComponentIn (connectedComponentIn_subset F y hx) hz)

/-- The preimage of a connected component is the union of the connected components at the points
of that preimage. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant1c4f093897d2ab484bbc6dc9c79a8d3dffb2cb6073033096e11b6a8082d19fd4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant1c4f093897d2ab484bbc6dc9c79a8d3dffb2cb6073033096e11b6a8082d19fd4.lean#L686).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5fa17d82b172a666f3d23997cd0dc5251cd09238` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
