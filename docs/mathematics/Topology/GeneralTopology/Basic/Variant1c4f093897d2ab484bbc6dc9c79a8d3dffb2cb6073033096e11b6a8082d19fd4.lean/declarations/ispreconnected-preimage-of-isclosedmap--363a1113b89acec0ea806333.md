## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e4144ca0-dfa7-633a-9804-330ab78a7c27`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 374–385.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsPreconnected.preimage_of_isClosedMap [TopologicalSpace β] {s : Set β}
    (hs : IsPreconnected s) {f : α → β} (hinj : Function.Injective f) (hf : IsClosedMap f)
    (hsf : s ⊆ range f) : IsPreconnected (f ⁻¹' s) :=
  isPreconnected_closed_iff.2 fun u v hu hv hsuv hsu hsv => by
    replace hsf : f '' f ⁻¹' s = s := image_preimage_eq_of_subset hsf
    obtain ⟨_, has, ⟨a, hau, rfl⟩, hav⟩ : (s ∩ (f '' u ∩ f '' v)).Nonempty := by
      refine isPreconnected_closed_iff.1 hs (f '' u) (f '' v) (hf u hu) (hf v hv) ?_ ?_ ?_

      · simpa only [image_preimage_inter] using hsu.image f
      · simpa only [image_preimage_inter] using hsv.image f
    · exact ⟨a, has, hau, hinj.mem_set_image.1 hav⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant1c4f093897d2ab484bbc6dc9c79a8d3dffb2cb6073033096e11b6a8082d19fd4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant1c4f093897d2ab484bbc6dc9c79a8d3dffb2cb6073033096e11b6a8082d19fd4.lean#L374).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5fa17d82b172a666f3d23997cd0dc5251cd09238` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
