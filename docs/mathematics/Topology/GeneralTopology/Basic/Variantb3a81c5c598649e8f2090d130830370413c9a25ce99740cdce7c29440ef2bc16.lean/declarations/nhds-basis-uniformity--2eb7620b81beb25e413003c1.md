## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:384067e7-549d-3acc-bd28-f7ffcbd2c477`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 742–748.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nhds_basis_uniformity {p : ι → Prop} {s : ι → Set (α × α)} (h : (𝓤 α).HasBasis p s)
    {x : α} : (𝓝 x).HasBasis p fun i => { y | (y, x) ∈ s i } := by
  replace h := h.comap Prod.swap
  rw [← map_swap_eq_comap_swap, ← uniformity_eq_symm] at h
  exact nhds_basis_uniformity' h
#align nhds_basis_uniformity nhds_basis_uniformity

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantb3a81c5c598649e8f2090d130830370413c9a25ce99740cdce7c29440ef2bc16.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantb3a81c5c598649e8f2090d130830370413c9a25ce99740cdce7c29440ef2bc16.lean#L742).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0fb08d4c0bcb32094ba5960b19ca36ca0e5e0465` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
