## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1a0d1cdb-10c2-da2c-993f-390a5e9c969f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1407–1414.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem uniformContinuous_sInf_dom {f : α → β} {u₁ : Set (UniformSpace α)} {u₂ : UniformSpace β}
    {u : UniformSpace α} (h₁ : u ∈ u₁) (hf : UniformContinuous[u, u₂] f) :
    UniformContinuous[sInf u₁, u₂] f := by
  delta UniformContinuous
  rw [sInf_eq_iInf', iInf_uniformity]
  exact tendsto_iInf' ⟨u, h₁⟩ hf
#align uniform_continuous_Inf_dom uniformContinuous_sInf_dom

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantb3a81c5c598649e8f2090d130830370413c9a25ce99740cdce7c29440ef2bc16.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantb3a81c5c598649e8f2090d130830370413c9a25ce99740cdce7c29440ef2bc16.lean#L1407).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0fb08d4c0bcb32094ba5960b19ca36ca0e5e0465` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
