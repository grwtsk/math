## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:18038421-87c9-cbdb-be11-0969253cf732`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 269–277.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendstoLocallyUniformly_iff [TopologicalSpace α] (F : ι → α → G) (f : α → G)
    (p : Filter ι) (hu : IsTopologicalGroup.toUniformSpace G = u) :
    TendstoLocallyUniformly F f p ↔
      ∀ u ∈ 𝓝 (1 : G), ∀ (x : α), ∃ t ∈ 𝓝 x, ∀ᶠ i in p, ∀ a ∈ t, F i a / f a ∈ u :=
  hu ▸ ⟨fun h u hu => h _ ⟨u, hu, fun _ => id⟩, fun h _ ⟨u, hu, hv⟩ x =>
    Exists.imp (fun _ ⟨h, hp⟩ => ⟨h, mem_of_superset hp fun _ hi a ha => hv (hi a ha)⟩)
      (h u hu x)⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variante2cf164f90cafe97bc31f214a3bb14bdc6649c6539afff6d81904d4bf2bf2ada.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variante2cf164f90cafe97bc31f214a3bb14bdc6649c6539afff6d81904d4bf2bf2ada.lean#L269).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b8c559016475cc6c7c1fb9abd49068dc6528497f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
