## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2260890f-f527-51a5-bd27-f610cb4e1b55`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 322–398.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-! ### Core construction for constructing fiber bundles -/

/-- Core data defining a locally trivial bundle with fiber `F` over a topological
space `B`. Note that "bundle" is used in its mathematical sense. This is the (computer science)
bundled version, i.e., all the relevant data is contained in the following structure. A family of
local trivializations is indexed by a type `ι`, on open subsets `baseSet i` for each `i : ι`.
Trivialization changes from `i` to `j` are given by continuous maps `coordChange i j` from
`baseSet i ∩ baseSet j` to the set of homeomorphisms of `F`, but we express them as maps
`B → F → F` and require continuity on `(baseSet i ∩ baseSet j) × F` to avoid the topology on the
space of continuous maps on `F`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant91a85c4354ee343625e620846233e69b3b9837d740e8820915bd9d8f0532e53b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
