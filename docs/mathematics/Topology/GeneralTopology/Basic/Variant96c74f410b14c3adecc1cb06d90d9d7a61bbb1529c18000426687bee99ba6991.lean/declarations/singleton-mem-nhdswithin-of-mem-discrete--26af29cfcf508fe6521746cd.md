## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d4056e09-e082-b75d-f820-515c6a40cfba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 866–874.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem singleton_mem_nhdsWithin_of_mem_discrete {s : Set X} (hs : IsDiscrete s) {x : X}
    (hx : x ∈ s) : {x} ∈ 𝓝[s] x := by
  rw [isDiscrete_iff_discreteTopology] at hs
  have : ({⟨x, hx⟩} : Set s) ∈ 𝓝 (⟨x, hx⟩ : s) := by simp [nhds_discrete]
  simpa only [nhdsWithin_eq_map_subtype_coe hx, image_singleton] using
    @image_mem_map _ _ _ ((↑) : s → X) _ this

/-- The neighbourhoods filter of `x` within `s`, under the discrete topology, is equal to
the pure `x` filter (which is the principal filter at the singleton `{x}`.) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant96c74f410b14c3adecc1cb06d90d9d7a61bbb1529c18000426687bee99ba6991.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant96c74f410b14c3adecc1cb06d90d9d7a61bbb1529c18000426687bee99ba6991.lean#L866).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2d39660bfd78f367e80c7ee07b36871de306e3f2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
