## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e166a4958bfd10f9be8188688eac0242ecc3f450f39f7d91304b504d22a29e1d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 361–373.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofWithBot (boxes : Finset (WithBot (Box ι)))
    (le_of_mem : ∀ J ∈ boxes, (J : WithBot (Box ι)) ≤ I)
    (pairwise_disjoint : Set.Pairwise (boxes : Set (WithBot (Box ι))) Disjoint) :
    Prepartition I where
  boxes := Finset.eraseNone boxes
  le_of_mem' J hJ := by
    rw [mem_eraseNone] at hJ
    simpa only [WithBot.some_eq_coe, WithBot.coe_le_coe] using le_of_mem _ hJ
  pairwiseDisjoint J₁ h₁ J₂ h₂ hne := by
    simp only [mem_coe, mem_eraseNone] at h₁ h₂
    exact Box.disjoint_coe.1 (pairwise_disjoint h₁ h₂ (mt Option.some_inj.1 hne))

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant3ca2168da65ff9409f99f1159f1db8af250c169a7912fb0225996898a8852738.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant3ca2168da65ff9409f99f1159f1db8af250c169a7912fb0225996898a8852738.lean#L361).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `502475e1069d68185b8cbc6864f656017fd924a6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
