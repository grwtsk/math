## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b44827ff-020b-d25f-d6bf-9202757a4ac0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 750–755.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem existsUnique (h : π.IsPartition) (hx : x ∈ I) :
    ∃! (J : _) (_ : J ∈ π), x ∈ J := by
  rcases h x hx with ⟨J, h, hx⟩
  exact ExistsUnique.intro₂ J h hx fun J' h' hx' => π.eq_of_mem_of_mem h' h hx' hx
#align box_integral.prepartition.is_partition.exists_unique BoxIntegral.Prepartition.IsPartition.existsUnique

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant2682fb9ada36fc0b67663d13632f21877c18db1c308dda18d65abaf516290e93.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant2682fb9ada36fc0b67663d13632f21877c18db1c308dda18d65abaf516290e93.lean#L750).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3265dc8b7b54a898d34d1e8a181c402e3663767c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
