## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5d539a14-543b-ac7b-c9c6-8e98d1e87a84`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 833–847.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cos_pi_div_five : cos (π / 5) = (1 + √5) / 4 := by
  set c := cos (π / 5)
  have : 4 * (c * c) + (-2) * c + (-1) = 0 := by
    rw [← sq, neg_mul, ← sub_eq_add_neg, ← sub_eq_add_neg]
    exact quadratic_root_cos_pi_div_five
  have hd : discrim 4 (-2) (-1) = (2 * √5) * (2 * √5) := by norm_num [discrim, mul_mul_mul_comm]
  rcases (quadratic_eq_zero_iff (by norm_num) hd c).mp this with h | h
  · field_simp [h]; linarith
  · absurd (show 0 ≤ c from cos_nonneg_of_mem_Icc <| by constructor <;> linarith [pi_pos.le])
    rw [not_le, h]
    exact div_neg_of_neg_of_pos (by norm_num [lt_sqrt]) (by positivity)

end CosDivSq

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant636577641a1c42c48873e8b621e0de8ea5eff6fa9f647a1badc118e303fcab4a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant636577641a1c42c48873e8b621e0de8ea5eff6fa9f647a1badc118e303fcab4a.lean#L833).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3a3c9c43836c739ad6841734e251a77902bbd88d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
