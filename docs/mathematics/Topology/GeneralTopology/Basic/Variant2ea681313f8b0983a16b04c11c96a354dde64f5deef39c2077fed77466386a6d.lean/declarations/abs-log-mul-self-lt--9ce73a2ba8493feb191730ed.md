## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:75ee31c1-524c-a88a-a878-adf7195e9034`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 334–347.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem abs_log_mul_self_lt (x : ℝ) (h1 : 0 < x) (h2 : x ≤ 1) : |log x * x| < 1 := by
  have : 0 < 1 / x := by simpa only [one_div, inv_pos] using h1
  replace := log_le_sub_one_of_pos this
  replace : log (1 / x) < 1 / x := by linarith
  rw [log_div one_ne_zero h1.ne', log_one, zero_sub, lt_div_iff₀ h1] at this
  have aux : 0 ≤ -log x * x := by
    refine mul_nonneg ?_ h1.le
    rw [← log_inv]
    apply log_nonneg
    rw [← le_inv_comm₀ h1 zero_lt_one, inv_one]

  rw [← abs_of_nonneg aux, neg_mul, abs_neg] at this
  exact this

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant2ea681313f8b0983a16b04c11c96a354dde64f5deef39c2077fed77466386a6d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant2ea681313f8b0983a16b04c11c96a354dde64f5deef39c2077fed77466386a6d.lean#L334).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `213c1a0fd9c778d656fadcb61775e45d46549c1e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
