## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:94ee7c15aa80ba15a333e511bb4b07261abbe530f7e15b5f026ca773107d95cf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 314–320.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def limitConePtAux : Subgroup (Π j : J, F.obj j) where
  carrier := {x | ∀ ⦃i j : J⦄ (π : i ⟶ j), F.map π (x i) = x j}
  mul_mem' hx hy _ _ π := by simp only [Pi.mul_apply, map_mul, hx π, hy π]
  one_mem' := by simp only [Set.mem_ofPred_eq, Pi.one_apply, map_one, implies_true]
  inv_mem' h _ _ π := by simp only [Pi.inv_apply, map_inv, h π]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant0c595c7f41ff36922dbb38967816db4e4714fce6378ecc36c6c03713327a90da.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant0c595c7f41ff36922dbb38967816db4e4714fce6378ecc36c6c03713327a90da.lean#L314).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `263a94b86ae16d63a773e3c342e8edf5520ce5f8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
