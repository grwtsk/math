## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c46ab4e3-21a8-f465-77c9-9b22271e8339`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–151.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma nnrpow_three (a : A) (ha : 0 ≤ a := by cfc_tac) : a ^ (3 : ℝ≥0) = a * a * a := by
  simp only [nnrpow_def, NNReal.nnrpow_def, NNReal.coe_ofNat, NNReal.rpow_ofNat, pow_three]
  change cfcₙ (fun z : ℝ≥0 => id z * (id z * id z)) a = a * a * a
  rw [cfcₙ_mul id _ a, cfcₙ_mul id _ a, ← mul_assoc, cfcₙ_id ℝ≥0 a]

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant7f8880cddfb97cb5d5a3e9eaeca2fd4204098853f0c1f5e7d5a01cce9a6af643.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant7f8880cddfb97cb5d5a3e9eaeca2fd4204098853f0c1f5e7d5a01cce9a6af643.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ec5dbefe8609409fed35b3e004162817c4bfc78` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
