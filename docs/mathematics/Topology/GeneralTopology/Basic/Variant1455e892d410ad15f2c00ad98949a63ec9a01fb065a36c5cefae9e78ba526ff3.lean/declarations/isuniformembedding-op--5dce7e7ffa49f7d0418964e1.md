## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7c9389c6-14e2-7945-6287-72a1cdd2dd82`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 736–747.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isUniformEmbedding_op [UniformSpace α] : IsUniformEmbedding (op : α → αᵐᵒᵖ) where
  injective := op_injective
  comap_uniformity := comap_uniformity_mulOpposite

end MulOpposite

section Prod

open UniformSpace

/-! a similar product space is possible on the function space (uniformity of pointwise convergence),
  but we want to have the uniformity of uniform convergence on function spaces -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant1455e892d410ad15f2c00ad98949a63ec9a01fb065a36c5cefae9e78ba526ff3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant1455e892d410ad15f2c00ad98949a63ec9a01fb065a36c5cefae9e78ba526ff3.lean#L736).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `465181b36d0694eedcd5d526c39adbe802970d7b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
