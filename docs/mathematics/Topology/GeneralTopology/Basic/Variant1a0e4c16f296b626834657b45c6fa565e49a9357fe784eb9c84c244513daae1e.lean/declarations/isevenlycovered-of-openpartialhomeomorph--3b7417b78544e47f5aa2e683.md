## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4e728977-ac41-25b1-283f-ea43ad45ff06`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 583–596.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsEvenlyCovered.of_openPartialHomeomorph
    [T2Space E] [T2Space X] [CompactSpace E] {x : X} (hf : Continuous f)
    (h : ∀ e ∈ f ⁻¹' {x}, ∃ φ : OpenPartialHomeomorph E X, e ∈ φ.source ∧ φ = f) :
    IsEvenlyCovered f x (f ⁻¹' {x}) :=
  hf.isClosedMap.isEvenlyCovered_of_openPartialHomeomorph
    ((isClosed_singleton.preimage hf).isCompact.finite (.of_openPartialHomeomorph f subset_rfl h)) h

/-- If `f : E → X` is a continuous map between Hausdorff spaces with `E` compact, `s` is a subset
of `X` such that `f` restricts to a homeomorphism on a neighborhood of every point of `f ⁻¹' s`,
then `f` is a covering map on `s`.

For example, `s` can be taken to be the set of regular values of a C¹ map `f : E → X`
where `E` and `X` are manifolds of the same dimension with `E` compact, according to
the inverse function theorem (see `ContDiffAt.toOpenPartialHomeomorph`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant1a0e4c16f296b626834657b45c6fa565e49a9357fe784eb9c84c244513daae1e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant1a0e4c16f296b626834657b45c6fa565e49a9357fe784eb9c84c244513daae1e.lean#L583).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fe1f79d0dfe2251d25e3cc2b15de0231a2fd54c0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
