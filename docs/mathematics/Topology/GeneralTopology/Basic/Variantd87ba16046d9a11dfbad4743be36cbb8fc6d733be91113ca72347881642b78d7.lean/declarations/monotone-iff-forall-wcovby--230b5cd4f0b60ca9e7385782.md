## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9fc064fa-2ee6-24d7-24c6-668d33edf72c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1178–1185.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma monotone_iff_forall_wcovBy [Preorder α] [LocallyFiniteOrder α] [Preorder β]
    (f : α → β) : Monotone f ↔ ∀ a b : α, a ⩿ b → f a ≤ f b := by
  refine ⟨fun hf _ _ h ↦ hf h.le, fun h a b hab ↦ ?_⟩
  simpa [transGen_eq_self (r := ((· : β) ≤ ·)) transitive_le]
    using TransGen.lift f h <| le_iff_transGen_wcovBy.mp hab

/-- A function from a locally finite partial order is monotone if and only if it is monotone when
restricted to pairs satisfying `a ⋖ b`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantd87ba16046d9a11dfbad4743be36cbb8fc6d733be91113ca72347881642b78d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantd87ba16046d9a11dfbad4743be36cbb8fc6d733be91113ca72347881642b78d7.lean#L1178).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4d730f5565a12cccc48bbf985896dd1fa2ec0eac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
