## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cdc86cf97144a24695c0c04ec2a91dc5ec0408ba7bba23d1a0448ad917de298a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 452–465.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def symmL (e : Trivialization F (π F E)) [e.IsLinear R] (b : B) : F →L[R] E b :=
  { e.symmₗ R b with
    toFun := e.symm b -- given explicitly to help `simps`
    cont := by
      by_cases hb : b ∈ e.baseSet
      · rw [(FiberBundle.totalSpaceMk_inducing F E b).continuous_iff]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant9d2cac5cf80fe06780c46d76123feb5d61956341f31c2e9120496cc7062c2d2d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant9d2cac5cf80fe06780c46d76123feb5d61956341f31c2e9120496cc7062c2d2d.lean#L452).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `88323637acd65639e883acfc9d0b58f6cd1a4088` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
