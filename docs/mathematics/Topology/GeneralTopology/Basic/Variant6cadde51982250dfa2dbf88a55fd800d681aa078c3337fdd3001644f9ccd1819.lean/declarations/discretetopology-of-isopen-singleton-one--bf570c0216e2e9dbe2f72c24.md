## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:96ff84b0-03ce-a510-fd6c-2a28b77d570d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 123–133.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem discreteTopology_of_isOpen_singleton_one (h : IsOpen ({1} : Set G)) :
    DiscreteTopology G := by
  rw [← singletons_open_iff_discrete]
  intro g
  suffices {g} = (g⁻¹ * ·) ⁻¹' {1} by
    rw [this]
    exact (continuous_mul_left g⁻¹).isOpen_preimage _ h
  simp only [mul_one, Set.preimage_mul_left_singleton, eq_self_iff_true, inv_inv,
    Set.singleton_eq_singleton_iff]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant6cadde51982250dfa2dbf88a55fd800d681aa078c3337fdd3001644f9ccd1819.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant6cadde51982250dfa2dbf88a55fd800d681aa078c3337fdd3001644f9ccd1819.lean#L123).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9a22ad1674e89ee63f70013ff524ece1efc15464` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
