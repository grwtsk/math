## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1c362ad3-6037-a0f8-120e-a308883e2934`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 342–356.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem zeroSection_snd [∀ x, Zero (E x)] (x : B) : (zeroSection F E x).2 = 0 :=
  rfl

end Bundle

open Bundle

variable [NontriviallyNormedField R] [∀ x, AddCommMonoid (E x)] [∀ x, Module R (E x)]
  [NormedAddCommGroup F] [NormedSpace R F] [TopologicalSpace B] [TopologicalSpace (TotalSpace F E)]
  [∀ x, TopologicalSpace (E x)] [FiberBundle F E]

/-- The space `Bundle.TotalSpace F E` (for `E : B → Type*` such that each `E x` is a topological
vector space) has a topological vector space structure with fiber `F` (denoted with
`VectorBundle R F E`) if around every point there is a fiber bundle trivialization which is linear
in the fibers. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant11df1c28f200a799fde80d32e1168ff8b1d94f4888318801459815a8c8d764b6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant11df1c28f200a799fde80d32e1168ff8b1d94f4888318801459815a8c8d764b6.lean#L342).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `819ab22cae2ff5c95513c9145fe1c5778bf4a61b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
