## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a198e172-ea5f-2fa3-684f-8571c66abdb6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 551–565.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma VectorBundle.completeSpace [CompleteSpace F]
    (E : B → Type*) [(x : B) → AddCommGroup (E x)] [(x : B) → Module R (E x)]
    [TopologicalSpace (TotalSpace F E)] [(x : B) → UniformSpace (E x)]
    [(x : B) → IsUniformAddGroup (E x)] [FiberBundle F E] [VectorBundle R F E] (b : B) :
    CompleteSpace (E b) := by
  let e := VectorBundle.continuousLinearEquivAt R F E b
  rwa [completeSpace_congr (e := e.toEquiv) e.isUniformEmbedding]

variable (B F)

/-- Analogous construction of `FiberBundleCore` for vector bundles. This
construction gives a way to construct vector bundles from a structure registering how
trivialization changes act on fibers. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Varianta68b0322e0dbcba8e9af3deb252fa895916a7ea8e670267893c0e8bd1b9da54b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Varianta68b0322e0dbcba8e9af3deb252fa895916a7ea8e670267893c0e8bd1b9da54b.lean#L551).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8c75d6dc02058c3177003eb1fd5c89c0ccd2eb81` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
