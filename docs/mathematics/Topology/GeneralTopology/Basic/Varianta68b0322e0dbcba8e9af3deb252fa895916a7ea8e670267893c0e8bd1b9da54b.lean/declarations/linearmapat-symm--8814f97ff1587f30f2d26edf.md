## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:94c8bdd8-b562-5aa1-3840-2e4cfb4cb24c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem linearMapAt_symmₗ (e : Pretrivialization F (π F E)) [e.IsLinear R] {b : B}
    (hb : b ∈ e.baseSet) (y : F) : e.linearMapAt R b (e.symmₗ R b y) = y := by simp [hb]

end Pretrivialization

variable [TopologicalSpace (TotalSpace F E)]

/-- A mixin class for `Bundle.Trivialization`, stating that a trivialization is fiberwise linear
with respect to given module structures on its fibers and the model fiber. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Varianta68b0322e0dbcba8e9af3deb252fa895916a7ea8e670267893c0e8bd1b9da54b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Varianta68b0322e0dbcba8e9af3deb252fa895916a7ea8e670267893c0e8bd1b9da54b.lean#L164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8c75d6dc02058c3177003eb1fd5c89c0ccd2eb81` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
