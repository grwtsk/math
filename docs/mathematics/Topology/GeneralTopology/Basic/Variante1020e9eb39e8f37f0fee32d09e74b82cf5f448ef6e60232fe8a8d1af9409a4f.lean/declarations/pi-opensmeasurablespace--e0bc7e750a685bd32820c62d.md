## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b53c2db6003ef63e2b81d8d66d72a4fc2f30daccd4d00edcf51fc8ddd9e2a02d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 360–377.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Pi.opensMeasurableSpace {ι : Type*} {X : ι → Type*} [Countable ι]
    [t' : ∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)] [∀ i, MeasurableSpace (X i)]
    [∀ i, SecondCountableTopology (X i)] [∀ i, OpensMeasurableSpace (X i)] :
    OpensMeasurableSpace (∀ i, X i) := by
  constructor
  have : Pi.topologicalSpace = .generateFrom { t | ∃ (s : ∀ a, Set (X a)) (i : Finset ι),
      (∀ a ∈ i, s a ∈ countableBasis (X a)) ∧ t = pi (↑i) s } := by
    simp only [funext fun a => @eq_generateFrom_countableBasis (X a) _ _, pi_generateFrom_eq]
  rw [borel_eq_generateFrom_of_subbasis this]
  apply generateFrom_le
  rintro _ ⟨s, i, hi, rfl⟩
  refine MeasurableSet.pi i.countable_toSet fun a ha => IsOpen.measurableSet ?_
  rw [eq_generateFrom_countableBasis (X a)]
  exact .basic _ (hi a ha)

/-- The typeclass `SecondCountableTopologyEither α β` registers the fact that at least one of
the two spaces has second countable topology. This is the right assumption to ensure that continuous
maps from `α` to `β` are strongly measurable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variante1020e9eb39e8f37f0fee32d09e74b82cf5f448ef6e60232fe8a8d1af9409a4f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variante1020e9eb39e8f37f0fee32d09e74b82cf5f448ef6e60232fe8a8d1af9409a4f.lean#L360).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ec87012329030fbd534787292e44cc35682b104e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
