## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:96514b38d4974417e2053733b497f109e440f8439883f7f6ee6033637cd36428`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 516–533.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkContinuousAlternating (f : E [⋀^ι]→ₗ[𝕜] (F [⋀^ι']→ₗ[𝕜] G))
    (C : ℝ) (H : ∀ m₁ m₂, ‖f m₁ m₂‖ ≤ (C * ∏ i, ‖m₁ i‖) * ∏ i, ‖m₂ i‖) :
    E [⋀^ι]→L[𝕜] (F [⋀^ι']→L[𝕜] G)  :=
  mkContinuous
    { toFun m := mkContinuous (f m) (C * ∏ i, ‖m i‖) <| H m
      map_update_add' m i x y := by ext1; simp
      map_update_smul' m i c x := by ext1; simp

        ext v'
        have : f v = 0 := by simpa using f.map_eq_zero_of_eq' v i j hv hij
        simp [this] }

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant2f7895800774c898bd00e4ce38be6a03387b3d91722f695b9633c10f71d23987.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant2f7895800774c898bd00e4ce38be6a03387b3d91722f695b9633c10f71d23987.lean#L516).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b21619ae8a5a046aa4cc639ee8f498b486e57114` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
