## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c7fe9681ba0ba6b15d7adf285ee1bb45fb135b53051b0be62b93f1085307c661`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1763–1774.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Prod.pseudoMetricSpaceMax : PseudoMetricSpace (α × β) :=
  let i := PseudoEMetricSpace.toPseudoMetricSpaceOfDist
    (fun x y : α × β => dist x.1 y.1 ⊔ dist x.2 y.2)
    (fun x y => (max_lt (edist_lt_top _ _) (edist_lt_top _ _)).ne) fun x y => by
      simp only [sup_eq_max, dist_edist, ← ENNReal.toReal_max (edist_ne_top _ _) (edist_ne_top _ _),
        Prod.edist_eq]
  i.replaceBornology fun s => by
    simp only [← isBounded_image_fst_and_snd, isBounded_iff_eventually, ball_image_iff, ←
      eventually_and, ← forall_and, ← max_le_iff]
    rfl
#align prod.pseudo_metric_space_max Prod.pseudoMetricSpaceMax

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant06b423f09ff5de6236a24088ad540b6f30950ea655e4c0dc8da71419ee2cf286.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant06b423f09ff5de6236a24088ad540b6f30950ea655e4c0dc8da71419ee2cf286.lean#L1763).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5ba8c647f38ac8be65be37d8efb559c9d2788fca` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
