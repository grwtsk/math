## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d54963bf-e8c2-8c9b-c35b-a9dcdd4298ce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1563–1572.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cauchySeq_of_le_tendsto_0' {s : β → α} (b : β → ℝ)
    (h : ∀ n m : β, n ≤ m → dist (s n) (s m) ≤ b n) (h₀ : Tendsto b atTop (𝓝 0)) : CauchySeq s :=
  Metric.cauchySeq_iff'.2 fun ε ε0 => (h₀.eventually (gt_mem_nhds ε0)).exists.imp fun N hN n hn =>
    calc dist (s n) (s N) = dist (s N) (s n) := dist_comm _ _
    _ ≤ b N := h _ _ hn
    _ < ε := hN
#align cauchy_seq_of_le_tendsto_0' cauchySeq_of_le_tendsto_0'

/-- If the distance between `s n` and `s m`, `n, m ≥ N` is bounded above by `b N`
and `b` converges to zero, then `s` is a Cauchy sequence.  -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant06b423f09ff5de6236a24088ad540b6f30950ea655e4c0dc8da71419ee2cf286.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant06b423f09ff5de6236a24088ad540b6f30950ea655e4c0dc8da71419ee2cf286.lean#L1563).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5ba8c647f38ac8be65be37d8efb559c9d2788fca` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
