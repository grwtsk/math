## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c9ca097c-eada-88e1-ad86-bc85e81ca7ec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1420–1428.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem uniformContinuous_iInf_rng {f : α → β} {u₁ : UniformSpace α} {u₂ : ι → UniformSpace β} :
    UniformContinuous[u₁, iInf u₂] f ↔ ∀ i, UniformContinuous[u₁, u₂ i] f := by
  delta UniformContinuous
  rw [iInf_uniformity, tendsto_iInf]
#align uniform_continuous_infi_rng uniformContinuous_iInf_rng

end UniformContinuousInfi

/-- A uniform space with the discrete uniformity has the discrete topology. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant0580a8e6c671b03d10413bee1bdd7787d38c2ce607a46200e0f9bccceccca6c9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant0580a8e6c671b03d10413bee1bdd7787d38c2ce607a46200e0f9bccceccca6c9.lean#L1420).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `095842172c30b0f12e6f84aa2a9ef6bac9e1441b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
