## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a7a839cc-2c67-fc4c-401b-ce361d793ce6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 150–162.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem center_eq_inversion' : c = inversion c R x ↔ x = c ∨ R = 0 :=
  eq_comm.trans inversion_eq_center'

### Similarity of triangles

If inversion with center `O` sends `A` to `A'` and `B` to `B'`, then the triangle `OB'A'` is similar
to the triangle `OAB` with coefficient `R ^ 2 / (|OA|*|OB|)` and the triangle `OA'B` is similar to
the triangle `OAB'` with coefficient `|OB|/|OA|`. We formulate these statements in terms of ratios
of the lengths of their sides.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantd66af030b45e8fb77b694f82ffd5f0b50c3d2f2303846974824cc839c5ce975f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantd66af030b45e8fb77b694f82ffd5f0b50c3d2f2303846974824cc839c5ce975f.lean#L150).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `34a6612d0f7fe41e7e4ca5ce5e38b650d52a4e22` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
