## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b6819c9aa7cb2b99d9be58c373b5005e0985f3c18ad8dcfa6b2e13b13ee542a6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class ENormedMonoid (E : Type*) [TopologicalSpace E] extends ContinuousENorm E, Monoid E where
  enorm_eq_zero : ∀ x : E, ‖x‖ₑ = 0 ↔ x = 1
  enorm_mul_le : ∀ x y : E, ‖x * y‖ₑ ≤ ‖x‖ₑ + ‖y‖ₑ

/-- An enormed commutative monoid is an additive commutative monoid
endowed with a continuous enorm.

We don't have `ENormedAddCommMonoid` extend `EMetricSpace`, since the canonical instance `ℝ≥0∞`
is not an `EMetricSpace`. This is because `ℝ≥0∞` carries the order topology, which is distinct from
the topology coming from `edist`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantb63776bcc52b22a9dedba729e05931981d3943f3ae0ef866845ebd9de68bbdff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantb63776bcc52b22a9dedba729e05931981d3943f3ae0ef866845ebd9de68bbdff.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fc7e567424b3e3f8e5965592a4b464df71d87ca2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
