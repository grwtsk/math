## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:423c705abcc9d3258cbc2d42eba1e4b71b3ddcebdd3d58d120ae6c14a3ea03e2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 371–383.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev GroupNorm.toNormedGroup [Group E] (f : GroupNorm E) : NormedGroup E :=
  { f.toGroupSeminorm.toSeminormedGroup with
    eq_of_dist_eq_zero := fun h => div_eq_one.1 <| eq_one_of_map_eq_zero f h }

-- See note [reducible non-instances]
/-- Construct a normed group from a norm, i.e., registering the distance and the metric space
structure from the norm properties. Note that in most cases this instance creates bad definitional
equalities (e.g., it does not take into account a possibly existing `UniformSpace` instance on
`E`). -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantb63776bcc52b22a9dedba729e05931981d3943f3ae0ef866845ebd9de68bbdff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantb63776bcc52b22a9dedba729e05931981d3943f3ae0ef866845ebd9de68bbdff.lean#L371).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fc7e567424b3e3f8e5965592a4b464df71d87ca2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
