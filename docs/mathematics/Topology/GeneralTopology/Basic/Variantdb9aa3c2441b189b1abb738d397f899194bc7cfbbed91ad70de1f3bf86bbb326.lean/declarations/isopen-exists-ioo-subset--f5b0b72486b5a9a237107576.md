## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:921b0f8f-772b-0ddd-d64c-160526ab257c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 463–476.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem IsOpen.exists_Ioo_subset [Nontrivial α] {s : Set α} (hs : IsOpen s) (h : s.Nonempty) :
    ∃ a b, a < b ∧ Ioo a b ⊆ s := by
  obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ : ∃ x, x ∈ s := h
  obtain ⟨y, hy⟩ : ∃ y, y ≠ x := exists_ne x
  rcases lt_trichotomy x y with (H | rfl | H)

    exact ⟨x, u, xu, Ioo_subset_Ico_self.trans hu⟩
  · exact (hy rfl).elim
  · obtain ⟨l, lx, hl⟩ : ∃ l, l < x ∧ Ioc l x ⊆ s :=
      exists_Ioc_subset_of_mem_nhds (hs.mem_nhds hx) ⟨y, H⟩
    exact ⟨l, x, lx, Ioo_subset_Ioc_self.trans hl⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantdb9aa3c2441b189b1abb738d397f899194bc7cfbbed91ad70de1f3bf86bbb326.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantdb9aa3c2441b189b1abb738d397f899194bc7cfbbed91ad70de1f3bf86bbb326.lean#L463).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6bdc8ca6049a776cdfbf567bda8ac8ee527505d1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
