## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:928f96d7-7d0a-f1c3-4dd8-d664c0f06d4b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 675–685.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem norm_image_sub_le (f : ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E G) (m₁ m₂ : ∀ i, E i) :
    ‖f m₁ - f m₂‖ ≤ ‖f‖ * Fintype.card ι * max ‖m₁‖ ‖m₂‖ ^ (Fintype.card ι - 1) * ‖m₁ - m₂‖ :=
  f.toMultilinearMap.norm_image_sub_le_of_bound (norm_nonneg _) f.le_opNorm _ _

end ContinuousMultilinearMap

variable [Fintype ι]

/-- If a continuous multilinear map is constructed from a multilinear map via the constructor
`mkContinuous`, then its norm is bounded by the bound given to the constructor if it is
nonnegative. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant3ffb0c6e9f1094bafdeead9932c8678bbcdd1a217c26415649e1e7fd4d26412b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant3ffb0c6e9f1094bafdeead9932c8678bbcdd1a217c26415649e1e7fd4d26412b.lean#L675).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7c4f4f226ccd3b3a4dc39673aa52f23372ff4c5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
