## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:82bded56-461c-2adb-9d42-bb98756d81f7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 522–532.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma sqrt_rpow_nnreal {a : A} {x : ℝ≥0} : sqrt (a ^ (x : ℝ)) = a ^ (x / 2 : ℝ) := by
  by_cases htriv : 0 ≤ a
  case neg => simp [sqrt_eq_cfc, rpow_def, cfc_apply_of_not_predicate a htriv]
  case pos =>
    cases eq_zero_or_pos x with
    | inl hx => simp [hx, rpow_zero _ htriv]
    | inr h₁ =>
      have h₂ : (x : ℝ) / 2 = NNReal.toReal (x / 2) := by simp
      have h₃ : 0 < x / 2 := by positivity
      rw [← nnrpow_eq_rpow h₁, h₂, ← nnrpow_eq_rpow h₃, sqrt_nnrpow (A := A)]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant5da39d56da3d94c569f6ff1be79e64f884aecd07c13c91837961e066681e6714.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant5da39d56da3d94c569f6ff1be79e64f884aecd07c13c91837961e066681e6714.lean#L522).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fc272c1b3532f1436f3cf02ed48bd066109c9e79` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
