## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e6657ad30a6598a0e17d9710a5513c61f43fc686e8905df1bc1fac49376bffcf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 368–380.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def indiscrete : ModuleCat.{v} R ⥤ TopModuleCat.{v} R where
  obj X :=
    letI : TopologicalSpace X := ⊤
    haveI : ContinuousAdd X := ⟨by rw [continuous_iff_coinduced_le]; exact le_top⟩
    haveI : ContinuousSMul R X := ⟨by rw [continuous_iff_coinduced_le]; exact le_top⟩
    .of R X
  map {X Y} f :=
    letI : TopologicalSpace X := ⊤
    letI : TopologicalSpace Y := ⊤
    ConcreteCategory.ofHom (C := TopModuleCat R)
      ⟨f.hom, by rw [continuous_iff_coinduced_le]; exact le_top⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant985dc9fdc2ee57202dec395d6a20fb1077533f7c95beb125cca3dd62c78b22e1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant985dc9fdc2ee57202dec395d6a20fb1077533f7c95beb125cca3dd62c78b22e1.lean#L368).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `224ec367aa4398676df74b95028dbff5a26b2d0b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
