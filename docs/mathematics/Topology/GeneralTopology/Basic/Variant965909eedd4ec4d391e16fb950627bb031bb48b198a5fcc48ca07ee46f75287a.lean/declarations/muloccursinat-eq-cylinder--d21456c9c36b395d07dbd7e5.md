## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0b74bf3a-78f1-37e3-1e06-0e42aa9670f4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 491–518.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma mulOccursInAt_eq_cylinder
    (p : Pattern A G) (g : G) :
    { x | p.mulOccursInAt x g } = cylinder (p.support.image (g * ·)) (p.mulShift g) := by
  ext x; constructor
  · -- ⇒: from an occurrence, get membership in the cylinder
    intro H u hu
    rcases Finset.mem_image.mp hu with ⟨w, hw, rfl⟩
    -- want: x ( w * g) = Pattern.mulShift p g ( w * g)
    have hx : x (g * w) = p.config w := H w hw
    simpa [Pattern.mulShift_apply_mul_left_of_mem (p := p) (v := g) (w := w) hw] using hx
  · -- ⇐: from the cylinder, recover an occurrence
    intro H u hu
    -- H gives equality with the translated pattern on the image
    have hx : x (g * u) = p.mulShift g (g * u) :=
      H (g * u) (Finset.mem_image_of_mem (g * ·) hu)
    -- rewrite the RHS by the “apply_of_mem” lemma
    simpa [Pattern.mulShift_apply_mul_left_of_mem (p := p) (v := g) (w := u) hu] using hx

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant965909eedd4ec4d391e16fb950627bb031bb48b198a5fcc48ca07ee46f75287a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant965909eedd4ec4d391e16fb950627bb031bb48b198a5fcc48ca07ee46f75287a.lean#L491).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a5cecafff31a4cb24b5c9f20a3f2e91100e5d125` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
