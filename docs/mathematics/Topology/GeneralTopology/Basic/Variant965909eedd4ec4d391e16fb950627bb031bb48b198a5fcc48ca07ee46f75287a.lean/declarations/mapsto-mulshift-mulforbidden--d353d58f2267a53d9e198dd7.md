## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a61b9e83-7a34-7e6a-037d-ab942c7525ce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 457–490.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma mapsTo_mulShift_mulForbidden {A G : Type*} [Inhabited A] [Monoid G]
    (F : Set (Pattern A G)) (h : G) :
    Set.MapsTo (mulShift h) (mulForbidden (A := A) (G := G) F) (mulForbidden F) := by
  -- unfold `MapsTo`
  intro x hx p hp g
  specialize hx p hp (h * g)
  contrapose! hx
  simpa [mulOccursInAt_mulShift] using hx

end Pattern

open scoped Classical in
/-- We call *occurrence set* for pattern `p` and position `g` the set of configurations
in which a pattern `p` occurs at position `g`.

This proves that it is exactly the cylinder corresponding to the
pattern obtained by translating `p` by `g`.

Equivalently, `p.mulOccursInAt x g` iff on every translated site
`g * w` (with `w ∈ p.support`)
the configuration `x` agrees with the translated pattern `Pattern.mulShift p g`.

(This uses `[IsLeftCancelMul G]` to identify the preimage along left-multiplication by `g`.) -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant965909eedd4ec4d391e16fb950627bb031bb48b198a5fcc48ca07ee46f75287a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant965909eedd4ec4d391e16fb950627bb031bb48b198a5fcc48ca07ee46f75287a.lean#L457).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a5cecafff31a4cb24b5c9f20a3f2e91100e5d125` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
