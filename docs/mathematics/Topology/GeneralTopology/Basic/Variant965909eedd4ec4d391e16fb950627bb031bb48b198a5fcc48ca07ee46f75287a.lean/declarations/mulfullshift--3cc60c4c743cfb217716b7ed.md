## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:693be8563d52ed5c75ce5ad66d55a39a36d99e194523ba95999c306f701f0931`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 272–288.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mulFullShift (A G) [TopologicalSpace A] [Monoid G] : MulSubshift A G where
  carrier := Set.univ
  isClosed := isClosed_univ
  mapsTo := fun _ _ _ => trivial

/-- A *pattern* is a finite configuration in the full shift `A^G`.

It consists of:
* a full configuration `config : G → A` in the full shift;
* a finite subset `support : Finset G` of coordinates, called the support of `p`;
* a proof `condition` that outside `support`, `config` takes the default value of `A`.

Intuitively, a pattern is a "partial configuration" specifying finitely many values of
a configuration in `G → A` (the rest being `default`).
Patterns are the basic building blocks used to define subshifts via forbidden configurations.
Note that each pattern corresponds to a cylinder, which is the set of configurations
which agree with this pattern on its support. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant965909eedd4ec4d391e16fb950627bb031bb48b198a5fcc48ca07ee46f75287a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant965909eedd4ec4d391e16fb950627bb031bb48b198a5fcc48ca07ee46f75287a.lean#L272).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a5cecafff31a4cb24b5c9f20a3f2e91100e5d125` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
