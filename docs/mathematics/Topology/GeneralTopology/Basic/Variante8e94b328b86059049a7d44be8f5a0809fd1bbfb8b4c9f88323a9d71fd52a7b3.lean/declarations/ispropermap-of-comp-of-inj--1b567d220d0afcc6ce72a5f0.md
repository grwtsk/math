## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9ff74518-0b63-9e3c-43d9-784ddd573f50`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 154–161.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isProperMap_of_comp_of_inj {f : X → Y} {g : Y → Z} (hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g)
    (hgf : IsProperMap (g ∘ f)) (g_inj : g.Injective) : IsProperMap f := by
  refine ⟨hf, fun ℱ y h ↦ ?_⟩
  rcases hgf.clusterPt_of_mapClusterPt (h.map hg.continuousAt tendsto_map) with ⟨x, hx1, hx2⟩
  exact ⟨x, g_inj hx1, hx2⟩

/-- If the composition of two continuous functions `f : X → Y` and `g : Y → Z` is proper
and `Y` is T2, then `f` is proper. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variante8e94b328b86059049a7d44be8f5a0809fd1bbfb8b4c9f88323a9d71fd52a7b3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variante8e94b328b86059049a7d44be8f5a0809fd1bbfb8b4c9f88323a9d71fd52a7b3.lean#L154).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `96337d3377ca238edfedb7e53e5dc4ed42a5058d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
