## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d83861f608538464168661ff6ae464e848124c32d4c67be4b1b1c7f9232828bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 78–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure IsProperMap (f : X → Y) : Prop extends Continuous f where
  /-- By definition, if `f` is a proper map and `ℱ` is any filter on `X`, then any cluster point of
  `map f ℱ` is the image by `f` of some cluster point of `ℱ`. -/
  clusterPt_of_mapClusterPt :
    ∀ ⦃ℱ : Filter X⦄, ∀ ⦃y : Y⦄, MapClusterPt y ℱ f → ∃ x, f x = y ∧ ClusterPt x ℱ

/-- Definition of proper maps. See also `isClosedMap_iff_clusterPt` for a related criterion
for closed maps. -/
add_decl_doc isProperMap_iff_clusterPt

/-- By definition, a proper map is continuous. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantdfac2fcc6fbced902f7006c00bfb92f0f02e0575682aef7e2270e0d2c834a6e8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variantdfac2fcc6fbced902f7006c00bfb92f0f02e0575682aef7e2270e0d2c834a6e8.lean#L78).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8e0a0e5481439cecbe6fb56766ecca3f7a8f6b6f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
