## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0b92bf7a6e0b5887976d99423d978068e91fa21c04360b5b3d4a22bf5ee84299`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 401–421.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def fromConfig (x : G → A) (U : Finset G) : Pattern A G := by
  classical
  exact { config := fun g => if g ∈ U then x g else default,
          support := U,
          condition := fun g hg => ite_eq_right hg }

/-- On the translated support, `p.mulShift v` agrees with `p.config` at the preimage.

More precisely, if `w ∈ p.support`, then at the translated site `v * w`,
the configuration `p.mulShift v` takes the value `p.config w`.

This uses `[IsLeftCancelMul G]` to identify the unique preimage of `v * w`
under left-multiplication by `v`. -/

  /-- On the translated support, `p.shift v` agrees with `p.config` at the preimage.

  More precisely, if `w ∈ p.support`, then at the translated site `v + w`,
  the configuration `p.shift v` takes the value `p.config w`.

  This uses `[IsLeftCancelAdd G]` to identify the unique preimage of `v + w`
  under left-translation by `v`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant95f6a5dadfcadb5e45912b2fd8d0851f3e8dcdf2f18c72fcc055084317ede27d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant95f6a5dadfcadb5e45912b2fd8d0851f3e8dcdf2f18c72fcc055084317ede27d.lean#L401).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `31bbc053051c9712a6ce08dac692522a01c3a5b8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
