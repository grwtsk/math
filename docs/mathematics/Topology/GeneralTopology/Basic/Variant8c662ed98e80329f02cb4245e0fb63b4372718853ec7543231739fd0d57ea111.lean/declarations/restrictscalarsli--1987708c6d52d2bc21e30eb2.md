## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2e207eb5d9df2fb6f4c8d84fae55cac5bdaa2ce491c9c7f3d5fa436df8cc0c96`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 362–374.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def restrictScalarsLI : E [⋀^ι]→L[𝕜] F →ₗᵢ[𝕜'] E [⋀^ι]→L[𝕜'] F where
  toFun := restrictScalars 𝕜'
  map_add' _ _ := rfl
  map_smul' _ _ := rfl
  norm_map' _ := rfl

end restrictScalars

/-- The difference `f m₁ - f m₂` is controlled in terms of `‖f‖` and `‖m₁ - m₂‖`, precise version.
For a less precise but more usable version, see `norm_image_sub_le`. The bound reads
`‖f m - f m'‖ ≤
  ‖f‖ * ‖m 1 - m' 1‖ * max ‖m 2‖ ‖m' 2‖ * max ‖m 3‖ ‖m' 3‖ * ... * max ‖m n‖ ‖m' n‖ + ...`,
where the other terms in the sum are the same products where `1` is replaced by any `i`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant8c662ed98e80329f02cb4245e0fb63b4372718853ec7543231739fd0d57ea111.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant8c662ed98e80329f02cb4245e0fb63b4372718853ec7543231739fd0d57ea111.lean#L362).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `52e68a3388580c4af7defad23b8085005083cc20` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
