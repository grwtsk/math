## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f4aa3577-47be-a665-d818-a7ccaba747c0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 123–134.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_bound_of_continuous (f : E [⋀^ι]→ₗ[𝕜] F) (hf : Continuous f) :
    ∃ (C : ℝ), 0 < C ∧ (∀ m, ‖f m‖ ≤ C * ∏ i, ‖m i‖) :=
  f.1.exists_bound_of_continuous hf

/-- If an alternating map `f` satisfies a boundedness property around `0`,
one can deduce a bound on `f m₁ - f m₂` using the multilinearity.
Here, we give a precise but hard to use version.
See `AlternatingMap.norm_image_sub_le_of_bound` for a less precise but more usable version.
The bound reads
`‖f m - f m'‖ ≤
  C * ‖m 1 - m' 1‖ * max ‖m 2‖ ‖m' 2‖ * max ‖m 3‖ ‖m' 3‖ * ... * max ‖m n‖ ‖m' n‖ + ...`,
where the other terms in the sum are the same products where `1` is replaced by any `i`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant9e07269ab8158f0f0e49f7fabc945e166fe5fe9c6391818d132df918d4704c62.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Basic/Variant9e07269ab8158f0f0e49f7fabc945e166fe5fe9c6391818d132df918d4704c62.lean#L123).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `462c52a08527078de61c79b7617f7697e57c1568` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
