## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `macro_rules` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:20429a3c8c339364f1d4cac67352936be18f32d45cd910a6c49809cdb6620694`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 36–48.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
local macro_rules | `($x ^ $y) => `(HPow.hPow $x $y) -- Porting note: See issue lean4#2220

noncomputable section

variable {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℂ E] (R : ℝ) (z w : ℂ)

namespace Complex

/-- Given a function `f : ℂ → E`, `circleTransform R z w f` is the function mapping `θ` to
`(2 * ↑π * I)⁻¹ • deriv (circleMap z R) θ • ((circleMap z R θ) - w)⁻¹ • f (circleMap z R θ)`.

If `f` is differentiable and `w` is in the interior of the ball, then the integral from `0` to
`2 * π` of this gives the value `f(w)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CircleTransform/Variant85c032803d20bab99bca12f0580da7ca663e9eb6368af799c9140614a92ba096.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CircleTransform/Variant85c032803d20bab99bca12f0580da7ca663e9eb6368af799c9140614a92ba096.lean#L36).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `49d59833be360f171e55d4b675c7ddb398676809` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
