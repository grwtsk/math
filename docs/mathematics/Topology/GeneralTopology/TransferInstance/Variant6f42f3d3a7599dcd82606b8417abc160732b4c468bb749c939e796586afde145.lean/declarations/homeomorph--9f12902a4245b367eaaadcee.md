## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cfb5fdf53f763bbcb9f4134c8fe657bafe8c5cfa027e36e635a5206d19ca7198`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 40–52.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def homeomorph [TopologicalSpace β] (e : α ≃ β) :
    letI := e.topologicalSpace
    α ≃ₜ β :=
  letI := e.topologicalSpace
  { e with
    continuous_toFun := continuous_induced_dom
    continuous_invFun := by
      simp only [Equiv.invFun_as_coe]
      convert! continuous_coinduced_rng
      rw [e.coinduced_symm]
      rfl }

end Equiv
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/TransferInstance/Variant6f42f3d3a7599dcd82606b8417abc160732b4c468bb749c939e796586afde145.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/TransferInstance/Variant6f42f3d3a7599dcd82606b8417abc160732b4c468bb749c939e796586afde145.lean#L40).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ff544257c77baa1b39be3216c10b8284e7e7c481` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
