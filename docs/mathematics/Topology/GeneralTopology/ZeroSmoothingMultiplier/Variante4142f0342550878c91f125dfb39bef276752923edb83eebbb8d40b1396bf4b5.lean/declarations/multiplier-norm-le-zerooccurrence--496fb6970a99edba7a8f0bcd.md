## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:86655bd8-4158-28a0-dbe9-3df86346abd3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 98–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem multiplier_norm_le_zeroOccurrence (ε : ℝ) (hε : 0 < ε) (o : ZeroOccurrence) :
    ‖multiplier ε hε (shiftedValue o)‖ ≤ Real.exp (ε / 2) :=
  multiplier_norm_le_strip ε hε (shiftedValue o)
    (abs_le.mpr ⟨(shiftedValue_strip o).1.le, (shiftedValue_strip o).2.le⟩)

/-- At zero the genuine multiplier integral is exactly the kernel's mass one. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ZeroSmoothingMultiplier/Variante4142f0342550878c91f125dfb39bef276752923edb83eebbb8d40b1396bf4b5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ZeroSmoothingMultiplier/Variante4142f0342550878c91f125dfb39bef276752923edb83eebbb8d40b1396bf4b5.lean#L98).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
