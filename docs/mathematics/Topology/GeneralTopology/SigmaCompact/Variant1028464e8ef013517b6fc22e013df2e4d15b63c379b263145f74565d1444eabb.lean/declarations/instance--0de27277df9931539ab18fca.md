## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:04dc0b6f4d741ad64f7331e5a171abbd28ecaa9dc1876bedbddc49c321de0348`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 256–269.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  · rcases exists_surjective_nat ι with ⟨f, hf⟩
    refine ⟨⟨fun n => ⋃ k ≤ n, Sigma.mk (f k) '' compactCovering (X (f k)) n, fun n => ?_, ?_⟩⟩
    · refine (finite_le_nat _).isCompact_biUnion fun k _ => ?_
      exact (isCompact_compactCovering _ _).image continuous_sigmaMk
    · simp only [iUnion_eq_univ_iff, Sigma.forall, mem_iUnion, hf.forall]
      intro k y
      rcases exists_mem_compactCovering y with ⟨n, hn⟩
      refine ⟨max k n, k, le_max_left _ _, mem_image_of_mem _ ?_⟩
      exact compactCovering_subset _ (le_max_right _ _) hn

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SigmaCompact/Variant1028464e8ef013517b6fc22e013df2e4d15b63c379b263145f74565d1444eabb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SigmaCompact/Variant1028464e8ef013517b6fc22e013df2e4d15b63c379b263145f74565d1444eabb.lean#L256).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e2888288cd6b3c863dea49c6f454c696e745b8e4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
