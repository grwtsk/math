## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d2d0571a-02c8-ba91-9b15-6c1725207e39`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 113–136.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma Topology.IsInducing.isSigmaCompact_iff {f : X → Y} {s : Set X}
    (hf : IsInducing f) : IsSigmaCompact s ↔ IsSigmaCompact (f '' s) := by
  constructor
  · exact fun h ↦ h.image hf.continuous
  · rintro ⟨L, hcomp, hcov⟩
    -- Suppose f(s) is σ-compact; we want to show s is σ-compact.
    -- Write f(s) as a union of compact sets L n, so s = ⋃ K n with K n := f⁻¹(L n) ∩ s.
    -- Since f is inducing, each K n is compact iff L n is.
    refine ⟨fun n ↦ f ⁻¹' (L n) ∩ s, ?_, ?_⟩

        _ = f ⁻¹' (f '' s) ∩ s := by rw [hcov]
        _ = s := inter_eq_right.mpr (subset_preimage_image _ _)

/-- If `f : X → Y` is an embedding, the image `f '' s` of a set `s` is σ-compact
if and only `s` is σ-compact. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SigmaCompact/Variantaa6f8dbee6e44e9cb7f88d30ca77ee6cbcd11ac3f3fef89039fbe8ef62ec00ff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SigmaCompact/Variantaa6f8dbee6e44e9cb7f88d30ca77ee6cbcd11ac3f3fef89039fbe8ef62ec00ff.lean#L113).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0dd298a20448c6ef208bf901868dcded37334039` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
