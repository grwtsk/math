## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5af33560-439a-c045-64c9-dcbe97897692`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 54–60.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isSigmaCompact_sUnion_of_isCompact {S : Set (Set X)} (hc : Set.Countable S)
    (hcomp : ∀ (s : Set X), s ∈ S → IsCompact s) : IsSigmaCompact (⋃₀ S) := by
  have : Countable S := countable_coe_iff.mpr hc
  rw [sUnion_eq_iUnion]
  apply isSigmaCompact_iUnion_of_isCompact _ (fun ⟨s, hs⟩ ↦ hcomp s hs)

/-- Countable unions of σ-compact sets are σ-compact. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SigmaCompact/Variante46f9a2081d574dc0c2b2ae21b9537f2aaadd93f51ffbc70967d6ee69fb5d841.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SigmaCompact/Variante46f9a2081d574dc0c2b2ae21b9537f2aaadd93f51ffbc70967d6ee69fb5d841.lean#L54).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b762bdc1d995cbd762640a9b95541f9205068dc8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
