## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4e1e56ce-d25b-9c27-c18f-6dd3ad9e9722`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 53–61.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isSigmaCompact_iUnion_of_isCompact [hι : Countable ι] (s : ι → Set X)
    (hcomp : ∀ i, IsCompact (s i)) : IsSigmaCompact (⋃ i, s i) := by
  rcases isEmpty_or_nonempty ι
  · simp only [iUnion_of_empty, isSigmaCompact_empty]
  · -- If ι is non-empty, choose a surjection f : ℕ → ι, this yields a map ℕ → Set X.
    obtain ⟨f, hf⟩ := countable_iff_exists_surjective.mp hι
    exact ⟨s ∘ f, fun n ↦ hcomp (f n), Function.Surjective.iUnion_comp hf _⟩

/-- Countable unions of compact sets are σ-compact. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SigmaCompact/Variantfe467c799e27cf14c30e8e8e43a5859f589419bfb079e6a7a600cab202850956.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SigmaCompact/Variantfe467c799e27cf14c30e8e8e43a5859f589419bfb079e6a7a600cab202850956.lean#L53).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f4cb963afa9e1678f649743f8e227ec21a8887aa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
