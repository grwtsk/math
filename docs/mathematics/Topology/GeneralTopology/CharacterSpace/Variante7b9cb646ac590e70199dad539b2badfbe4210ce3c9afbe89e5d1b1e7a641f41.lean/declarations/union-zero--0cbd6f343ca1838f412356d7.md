## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:66fd8450-26c1-e3c9-84f9-444a12b0255b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 117–125.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem union_zero :
    characterSpace 𝕜 A ∪ {0} = {φ : WeakDual 𝕜 A | ∀ x y : A, φ (x * y) = φ x * φ y} :=
  le_antisymm (by
      rintro φ (hφ | rfl)
      · exact hφ.2
      · exact fun _ _ => by exact (zero_mul (0 : 𝕜)).symm)
    fun φ hφ => Or.elim (em <| φ = 0) Or.inr fun h₀ => Or.inl ⟨h₀, hφ⟩

/-- The `characterSpace 𝕜 A` along with `0` is always a closed set in `WeakDual 𝕜 A`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CharacterSpace/Variante7b9cb646ac590e70199dad539b2badfbe4210ce3c9afbe89e5d1b1e7a641f41.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CharacterSpace/Variante7b9cb646ac590e70199dad539b2badfbe4210ce3c9afbe89e5d1b1e7a641f41.lean#L117).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `52921dc782f76178eba15c999ba01705a22a8bbc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
