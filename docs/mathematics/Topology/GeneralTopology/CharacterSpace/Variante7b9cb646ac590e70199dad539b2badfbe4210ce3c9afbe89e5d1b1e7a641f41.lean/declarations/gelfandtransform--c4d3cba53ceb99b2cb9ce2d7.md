## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f9fd1b7f4beed0c8d9276d0eb943794a1e7abacd6003386a32b3b6150eb4cdfe`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 225–237.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def gelfandTransform : A →ₐ[𝕜] C(characterSpace 𝕜 A, 𝕜) where
  toFun a :=
    { toFun := fun φ => φ a
      continuous_toFun := (eval_continuous a).comp continuous_induced_dom }
  map_one' := by ext a; simp only [coe_mk, coe_one, Pi.one_apply, map_one a]
  map_mul' a b := by ext; simp only [map_mul, coe_mk, coe_mul, Pi.mul_apply]
  map_zero' := by ext; simp only [map_zero, coe_mk, coe_mul, coe_zero, Pi.zero_apply]
  map_add' a b := by ext; simp only [map_add, coe_mk, coe_add, Pi.add_apply]
  commutes' k := by ext; simp [AlgHomClass.commutes]

end GelfandTransform

end WeakDual
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CharacterSpace/Variante7b9cb646ac590e70199dad539b2badfbe4210ce3c9afbe89e5d1b1e7a641f41.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CharacterSpace/Variante7b9cb646ac590e70199dad539b2badfbe4210ce3c9afbe89e5d1b1e7a641f41.lean#L225).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `52921dc782f76178eba15c999ba01705a22a8bbc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
