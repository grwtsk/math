## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:529e7a75-26f7-5921-b77c-06c912e4c29c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 167–180.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_set_map_one_map_mul [Nontrivial 𝕜] :
    characterSpace 𝕜 A = {φ : WeakDual 𝕜 A | φ 1 = 1 ∧ ∀ x y : A, φ (x * y) = φ x * φ y} := by
  ext φ
  refine ⟨?_, ?_⟩
  · rintro hφ
    lift φ to characterSpace 𝕜 A using hφ
    exact ⟨map_one φ, map_mul φ⟩
  · rintro ⟨hφ₁, hφ₂⟩
    refine ⟨?_, hφ₂⟩
    rintro rfl
    exact zero_ne_one hφ₁

/-- under suitable mild assumptions on `𝕜`, the character space is a closed set in
`WeakDual 𝕜 A`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CharacterSpace/Variant04020d7828fce0a6d13e698675b581618b6c2fbbd71d68df84eb5d5201292303.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CharacterSpace/Variant04020d7828fce0a6d13e698675b581618b6c2fbbd71d68df84eb5d5201292303.lean#L167).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0202702d8b0943875abde77fdc64e27b0e6d4bf6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
