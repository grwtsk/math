## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a0f637cb-a5d9-803b-028c-bc4c53eaab2d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 277–282.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_compl_zeroLocus_iff_notMem {f : A} {I : ProjectiveSpectrum 𝒜} :
    I ∈ (zeroLocus 𝒜 {f} : Set (ProjectiveSpectrum 𝒜))ᶜ ↔ f ∉ I.asHomogeneousIdeal := by
  rw [Set.mem_compl_iff, mem_zeroLocus, Set.singleton_subset_iff]; rfl

/-- The Zariski topology on the prime spectrum of a commutative ring is defined via the closed sets
of the topology: they are exactly those sets that are the zero locus of a subset of the ring. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variant9d92f7487a209a535394255727044141670cdb7d3ec62a341d22817188dd559e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variant9d92f7487a209a535394255727044141670cdb7d3ec62a341d22817188dd559e.lean#L277).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e34b257690db0286ade6006e310f0dc7347771e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
