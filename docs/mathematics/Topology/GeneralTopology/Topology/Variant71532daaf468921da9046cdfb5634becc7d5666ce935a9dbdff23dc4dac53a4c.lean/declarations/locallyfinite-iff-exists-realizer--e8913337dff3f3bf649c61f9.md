## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d7ee822b-2634-e783-0b67-e8ba3ec6dc42`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 232–246.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem locallyFinite_iff_exists_realizer [TopologicalSpace α] (F : Ctop.Realizer α)
    {f : β → Set α} : LocallyFinite f ↔ Nonempty (LocallyFinite.Realizer F f) :=
  ⟨fun h ↦
    let ⟨g, h₁⟩ := Classical.axiom_of_choice h
    let ⟨g₂, h₂⟩ :=
      Classical.axiom_of_choice fun x ↦
        show ∃ b : F.σ, x ∈ F.F b ∧ F.F b ⊆ g x from
          let ⟨h, _h'⟩ := h₁ x
          F.mem_nhds.1 h
    ⟨⟨fun x ↦ ⟨g₂ x, (h₂ x).1⟩, fun x ↦
        Finite.fintype <|
          let ⟨_h, h'⟩ := h₁ x
          h'.subset fun _i hi ↦ hi.mono (inter_subset_inter_right _ (h₂ x).2)⟩⟩,
    fun ⟨R⟩ ↦ R.to_locallyFinite⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variant71532daaf468921da9046cdfb5634becc7d5666ce935a9dbdff23dc4dac53a4c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variant71532daaf468921da9046cdfb5634becc7d5666ce935a9dbdff23dc4dac53a4c.lean#L232).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d2a0150214ad911435fb45c236d4a235c1bd65a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
