## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:60b554d14f48d3b7ce8cf0d9e2ea11bdd33f5a2621bac50c6eec8e4667790108`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 370–382.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def continuousAlternatingMapCongrLeft (f : E ≃L[𝕜] E') :
    E [⋀^ι]→L[𝕜] F ≃L[𝕜] (E' [⋀^ι]→L[𝕜] F) where
  __ := f.continuousAlternatingMapCongrLeftEquiv
  __ := ContinuousAlternatingMap.compContinuousLinearMapCLM (f.symm : E' →L[𝕜] E)
  toFun g := g.compContinuousLinearMap (f.symm : E' →L[𝕜] E)
  continuous_invFun :=
    (ContinuousAlternatingMap.compContinuousLinearMapCLM (f : E →L[𝕜] E')).cont
  continuous_toFun :=
    (ContinuousAlternatingMap.compContinuousLinearMapCLM (f.symm : E' →L[𝕜] E)).cont

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variant08ea978cd710ef37a6aa6e01b85c8f15f3fd5011bd3539623a4fbeb0cd4d5d87.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variant08ea978cd710ef37a6aa6e01b85c8f15f3fd5011bd3539623a4fbeb0cd4d5d87.lean#L370).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `66acc2bc41e4175777a75bc965c24ba9b1722ec1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
