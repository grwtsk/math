## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bddda096-29af-beef-f8a9-009671bed9bc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 647–652.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem basicOpen_eq_bot_iff (f : R) : basicOpen f = ⊥ ↔ IsNilpotent f := by
  rw [← TopologicalSpace.Opens.coe_inj, basicOpen_eq_zeroLocus_compl]
  simp only [Set.eq_univ_iff_forall, Set.singleton_subset_iff, TopologicalSpace.Opens.coe_bot,
    nilpotent_iff_mem_prime, Set.compl_empty_iff, mem_zeroLocus, SetLike.mem_coe]
  exact ⟨fun h I hI => h ⟨I, hI⟩, fun h ⟨I, hI⟩ => h I hI⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variant678871c1bbb85c9cfff8ae15027c7e47e75d417daa4b0af6ceba04734bf8f154.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variant678871c1bbb85c9cfff8ae15027c7e47e75d417daa4b0af6ceba04734bf8f154.lean#L647).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3a11176296f7ba9ca555235e23b54d42f95b5146` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
