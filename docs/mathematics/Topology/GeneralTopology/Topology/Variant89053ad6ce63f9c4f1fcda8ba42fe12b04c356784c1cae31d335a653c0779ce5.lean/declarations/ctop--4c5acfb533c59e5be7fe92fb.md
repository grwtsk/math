## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8b7c6846eff7ca51e218f8e743a0fe3d7f506c0b7c423bdbd2ec7c497ff05e34`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 35–45.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Ctop (α σ : Type*) where
  f : σ → Set α
  top : α → σ
  top_mem : ∀ x : α, x ∈ f (top x)
  inter : ∀ (a b) (x : α), x ∈ f a ∩ f b → σ
  inter_mem : ∀ a b x h, x ∈ f (inter a b x h)
  inter_sub : ∀ a b x h, f (inter a b x h) ⊆ f a ∩ f b
#align ctop Ctop

variable {α : Type*} {β : Type*} {σ : Type*} {τ : Type*}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variant89053ad6ce63f9c4f1fcda8ba42fe12b04c356784c1cae31d335a653c0779ce5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variant89053ad6ce63f9c4f1fcda8ba42fe12b04c356784c1cae31d335a653c0779ce5.lean#L35).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b38ab3a942556522b262016fecdb36dc1c171d3c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
