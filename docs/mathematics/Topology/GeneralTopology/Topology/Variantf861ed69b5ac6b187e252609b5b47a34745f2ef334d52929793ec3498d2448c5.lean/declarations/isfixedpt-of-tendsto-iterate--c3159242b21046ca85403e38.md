## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b1000a74-6523-9498-7c8e-0b235e335a2b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 43–49.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isFixedPt_of_tendsto_iterate {x y : α} (hy : Tendsto (fun n => f^[n] x) atTop (𝓝 y))
    (hf : ContinuousAt f y) : IsFixedPt f y := by
  refine tendsto_nhds_unique ((tendsto_add_atTop_iff_nat 1).1 ?_) hy
  simp only [iterate_succ' f]
  exact hf.tendsto.comp hy

/-- The set of fixed points of a continuous map is a closed set. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variantf861ed69b5ac6b187e252609b5b47a34745f2ef334d52929793ec3498d2448c5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variantf861ed69b5ac6b187e252609b5b47a34745f2ef334d52929793ec3498d2448c5.lean#L43).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
