## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:56286802f27c4a6bb04a0435dd835943b47ec40777cd9c0a13de24649109a00e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ProjectiveSpectrum where
  asHomogeneousIdeal : HomogeneousIdeal 𝒜
  isPrime : asHomogeneousIdeal.toIdeal.IsPrime
  not_irrelevant_le : ¬HomogeneousIdeal.irrelevant 𝒜 ≤ asHomogeneousIdeal
#align projective_spectrum ProjectiveSpectrum

attribute [instance] ProjectiveSpectrum.isPrime

namespace ProjectiveSpectrum

/-- The zero locus of a set `s` of elements of a commutative ring `A` is the set of all relevant
homogeneous prime ideals of the ring that contain the set `s`.

An element `f` of `A` can be thought of as a dependent function on the projective spectrum of `𝒜`.
At a point `x` (a homogeneous prime ideal) the function (i.e., element) `f` takes values in the
quotient ring `A` modulo the prime ideal `x`. In this manner, `zeroLocus s` is exactly the subset
of `ProjectiveSpectrum 𝒜` where all "functions" in `s` vanish simultaneously. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variantf6655b0eac79040225c217238beee4a357916497e25bd42d5756c708f216d00e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variantf6655b0eac79040225c217238beee4a357916497e25bd42d5756c708f216d00e.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `76c38dea355928fbdf95c02167c4a5bbad38ea81` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
