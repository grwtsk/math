## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:964a98cb-edbf-f857-a1a8-bfbf3819e852`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 377–391.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem comap_isInducing_of_surjective (hf : Surjective f) : IsInducing (comap f) where
  eq_induced := by
    simp only [TopologicalSpace.ext_iff, ← isClosed_compl_iff, isClosed_iff_zeroLocus,
      isClosed_induced_iff]
    refine fun s =>
      ⟨fun ⟨F, hF⟩ =>
        ⟨zeroLocus (f ⁻¹' F), ⟨f ⁻¹' F, rfl⟩, by
          rw [preimage_comap_zeroLocus, Function.Surjective.image_preimage hf, hF]⟩,
        ?_⟩
    rintro ⟨-, ⟨F, rfl⟩, hF⟩
    exact ⟨f '' F, hF.symm.trans (preimage_comap_zeroLocus f F)⟩

/-- The embedding has closed range if the domain (and therefore the codomain) is a ring,
  see `PrimeSpectrum.isClosedEmbedding_comap_of_surjective`.
  On the other hand, `comap (Nat.castRingHom (ZMod 2))` does not have closed range. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variantf400ec04ef7cbe468ce7109ba581b2abb13a163bc23361388d6c3e4846b2426d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variantf400ec04ef7cbe468ce7109ba581b2abb13a163bc23361388d6c3e4846b2426d.lean#L377).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8595a4eca910e154d0983fef668e2cc977aa1a0a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
