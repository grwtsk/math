## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:89ced3b4004e9b212ddc6c828a910ce190774163bec702207ca518f8d86d176c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 818–832.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def localizationMapOfSpecializes {x y : PrimeSpectrum R} (h : x ⤳ y) :
    Localization.AtPrime y.asIdeal →+* Localization.AtPrime x.asIdeal :=
  @IsLocalization.lift _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Localization.isLocalization
    (algebraMap R (Localization.AtPrime x.asIdeal))
    (by
      rintro ⟨a, ha⟩
      rw [← PrimeSpectrum.le_iff_specializes, ← asIdeal_le_asIdeal, ← SetLike.coe_subset_coe, ←
        Set.compl_subset_compl] at h
      exact (IsLocalization.map_units (Localization.AtPrime x.asIdeal)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variant9dc5ef7fb0fd2ea06b696dadb86c92ed803ed944879d0c260a7cbea1e0935aa5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variant9dc5ef7fb0fd2ea06b696dadb86c92ed803ed944879d0c260a7cbea1e0935aa5.lean#L818).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `785e3ed3c72359e96d30ee598be8c3e59e4145f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
