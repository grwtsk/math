## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:43338ead-e3a2-b538-dde3-d6cf07f2c9d3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1288–1292.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma closed_point_mem_iff {U : TopologicalSpace.Opens (PrimeSpectrum R)} :
    closedPoint R ∈ U ↔ U = ⊤ :=
  ⟨(eq_top_iff.mpr fun x _ ↦ (specializes_closedPoint x).mem_open U.2 ·), (· ▸ trivial)⟩

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variant9dc5ef7fb0fd2ea06b696dadb86c92ed803ed944879d0c260a7cbea1e0935aa5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Topology/Variant9dc5ef7fb0fd2ea06b696dadb86c92ed803ed944879d0c260a7cbea1e0935aa5.lean#L1288).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `785e3ed3c72359e96d30ee598be8c3e59e4145f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
