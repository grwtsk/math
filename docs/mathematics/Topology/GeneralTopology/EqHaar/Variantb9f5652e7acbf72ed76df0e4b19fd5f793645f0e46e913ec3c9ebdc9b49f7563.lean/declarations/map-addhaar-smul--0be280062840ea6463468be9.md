## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a29e68b6-ddf7-68d2-fa35-b137b4ffd310`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 344–352.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_addHaar_smul {r : ℝ} (hr : r ≠ 0) :
    Measure.map (r • ·) μ = ENNReal.ofReal (abs (r ^ finrank ℝ E)⁻¹) • μ := by
  let f : E →ₗ[ℝ] E := r • (1 : E →ₗ[ℝ] E)
  change Measure.map f μ = _
  have hf : LinearMap.det f ≠ 0 := by
    simp only [f, mul_one, LinearMap.det_smul, Ne, map_one]
    exact pow_ne_zero _ hr
  simp only [f, map_linearMap_addHaar_eq_smul_addHaar μ hf, mul_one, LinearMap.det_smul, map_one]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/EqHaar/Variantb9f5652e7acbf72ed76df0e4b19fd5f793645f0e46e913ec3c9ebdc9b49f7563.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/EqHaar/Variantb9f5652e7acbf72ed76df0e4b19fd5f793645f0e46e913ec3c9ebdc9b49f7563.lean#L344).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ef415bffee55a89d8af50fea647b7b5afb1871a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
