## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a7a1a068-3e44-5fa1-4da6-d837962883a2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 442–447.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem addHaar_ball_mul_of_pos (x : E) {r : ℝ} (hr : 0 < r) (s : ℝ) :
    μ (ball x (r * s)) = ENNReal.ofReal (r ^ finrank ℝ E) * μ (ball 0 s) := by
  have : ball (0 : E) (r * s) = r • ball (0 : E) s := by
    simp only [_root_.smul_ball hr.ne' (0 : E) s, Real.norm_eq_abs, abs_of_nonneg hr.le, smul_zero]
  simp only [this, addHaar_smul, abs_of_nonneg hr.le, addHaar_ball_center, abs_pow]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/EqHaar/Variant330e37a1c7af6facded614d6a672d512342b2c36bf47db1d3f92f1aab7151c91.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/EqHaar/Variant330e37a1c7af6facded614d6a672d512342b2c36bf47db1d3f92f1aab7151c91.lean#L442).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c95bf2c56c27d9f880c0438348b4a221d7abf93b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
