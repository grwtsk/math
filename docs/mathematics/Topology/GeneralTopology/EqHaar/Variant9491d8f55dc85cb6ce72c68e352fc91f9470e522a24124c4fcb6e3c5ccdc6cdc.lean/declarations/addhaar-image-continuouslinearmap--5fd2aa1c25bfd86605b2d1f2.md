## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f786d989-304e-09ba-d58e-511e02f20657`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 313–320.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem addHaar_image_continuousLinearMap (f : E →L[ℝ] E) (s : Set E) :
    μ (f '' s) = ENNReal.ofReal |LinearMap.det (f : E →ₗ[ℝ] E)| * μ s :=
  addHaar_image_linearMap μ _ s
#align measure_theory.measure.add_haar_image_continuous_linear_map MeasureTheory.Measure.addHaar_image_continuousLinearMap

/-- The image of a set `s` under a continuous linear equiv `f` has measure
equal to `μ s` times the absolute value of the determinant of `f`. -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/EqHaar/Variant9491d8f55dc85cb6ce72c68e352fc91f9470e522a24124c4fcb6e3c5ccdc6cdc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/EqHaar/Variant9491d8f55dc85cb6ce72c68e352fc91f9470e522a24124c4fcb6e3c5ccdc6cdc.lean#L313).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0226abd034d26f7e28deaa6a97b3fe7cea4aed41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
