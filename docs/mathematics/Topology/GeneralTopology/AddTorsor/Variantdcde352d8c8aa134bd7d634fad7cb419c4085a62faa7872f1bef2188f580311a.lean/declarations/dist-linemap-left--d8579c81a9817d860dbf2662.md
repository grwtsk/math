## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:76f992bd-4c96-d1aa-ece9-8025754dac6d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 99–105.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dist_lineMap_left (p₁ p₂ : P) (c : 𝕜) : dist (lineMap p₁ p₂ c) p₁ = ‖c‖ * dist p₁ p₂ := by
  -- Porting note: was
  -- simpa only [lineMap_apply_zero, dist_zero_right] using dist_lineMap_lineMap p₁ p₂ c 0
  rw [← dist_zero_right, ← dist_lineMap_lineMap, lineMap_apply_zero]
#align dist_line_map_left dist_lineMap_left

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/AddTorsor/Variantdcde352d8c8aa134bd7d634fad7cb419c4085a62faa7872f1bef2188f580311a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/AddTorsor/Variantdcde352d8c8aa134bd7d634fad7cb419c4085a62faa7872f1bef2188f580311a.lean#L99).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
