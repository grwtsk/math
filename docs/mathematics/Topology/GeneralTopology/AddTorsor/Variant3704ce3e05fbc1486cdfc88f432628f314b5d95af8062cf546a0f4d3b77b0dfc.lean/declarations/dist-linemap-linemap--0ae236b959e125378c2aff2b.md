## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3ceb8e7b-d774-bcf8-346b-de4c0db7cb2e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–68.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dist_lineMap_lineMap (p₁ p₂ : P) (c₁ c₂ : 𝕜) :
    dist (lineMap p₁ p₂ c₁) (lineMap p₁ p₂ c₂) = dist c₁ c₂ * dist p₁ p₂ := by
  rw [dist_comm p₁ p₂]
  simp only [lineMap_apply, dist_eq_norm_vsub, vadd_vsub_vadd_cancel_right,
    ← sub_smul, norm_smul, vsub_eq_sub]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/AddTorsor/Variant3704ce3e05fbc1486cdfc88f432628f314b5d95af8062cf546a0f4d3b77b0dfc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/AddTorsor/Variant3704ce3e05fbc1486cdfc88f432628f314b5d95af8062cf546a0f4d3b77b0dfc.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bbefa7f4db786f0b2c7e81fb826b6abf5e5b56e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
