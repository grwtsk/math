## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:79d43acdb71dfea50a24aa4bd169364640be75ca86acfd810ed662be58832498`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 276–285.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def DilationEquiv.smulTorsor (c : P) {k : 𝕜} (hk : k ≠ 0) : E ≃ᵈ P where
  toFun := (k • · +ᵥ c)
  invFun := k⁻¹ • (· -ᵥ c)
  left_inv x := by simp [inv_smul_smul₀ hk]
  right_inv p := by simp [smul_inv_smul₀ hk]
  edist_eq' := ⟨‖k‖₊, nnnorm_ne_zero_iff.mpr hk, fun x y ↦ by
    rw [show edist (k • x +ᵥ c) (k • y +ᵥ c) = _ from (IsometryEquiv.vaddConst c).isometry ..]
    exact edist_smul₀ ..⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/AddTorsor/Variant3704ce3e05fbc1486cdfc88f432628f314b5d95af8062cf546a0f4d3b77b0dfc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/AddTorsor/Variant3704ce3e05fbc1486cdfc88f432628f314b5d95af8062cf546a0f4d3b77b0dfc.lean#L276).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bbefa7f4db786f0b2c7e81fb826b6abf5e5b56e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
