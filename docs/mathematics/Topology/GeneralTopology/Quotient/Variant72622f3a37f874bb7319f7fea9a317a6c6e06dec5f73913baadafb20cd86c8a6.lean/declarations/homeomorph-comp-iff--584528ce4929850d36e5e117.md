## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e948f6e1-1b35-d596-091f-5ca8885e5a68`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 91–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[to_additive (attr := simp)] theorem homeomorph_comp_iff {Y} [TopologicalSpace Y]
    (φ : X ≃ₜ Y) : IsQuotientCoveringMap (φ ∘ f) G ↔ IsQuotientCoveringMap f G where
  mp h := by convert! h.homeomorph_comp φ.symm; ext; simp
  mpr h := h.homeomorph_comp φ

/-- Fibers of a quotient covering map by a group G is a G-torsor. -/
@[to_additive /-- Fibers of a quotient covering map by an additive group G is a G-torsor. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Quotient/Variant72622f3a37f874bb7319f7fea9a317a6c6e06dec5f73913baadafb20cd86c8a6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Quotient/Variant72622f3a37f874bb7319f7fea9a317a6c6e06dec5f73913baadafb20cd86c8a6.lean#L91).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c82fdbbdefcc9d0ccaa3c8de9fe4e783a1916150` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
