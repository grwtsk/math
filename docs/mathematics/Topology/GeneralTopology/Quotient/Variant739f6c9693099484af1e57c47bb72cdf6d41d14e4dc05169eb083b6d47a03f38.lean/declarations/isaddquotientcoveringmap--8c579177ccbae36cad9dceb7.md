## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:265ea667fc6c8d9f4c308d889be54890897a9390f2e9e3dc680a966a3a2d5dd0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 36–45.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure IsAddQuotientCoveringMap (G) [AddGroup G] [AddAction G E] : Prop
    extends IsQuotientMap f, ContinuousConstVAdd G E where
  apply_eq_iff_mem_orbit {e₁ e₂} : f e₁ = f e₂ ↔ e₁ ∈ AddAction.orbit G e₂
  disjoint (e : E) : ∃ U ∈ 𝓝 e, ∀ g : G, ((g +ᵥ ·) '' U ∩ U).Nonempty → g = 0

/-- A function from a topological space `E` with an action by a discrete group to another
topological space `X` is a quotient covering map if it is a quotient map, the action is
continuous and transitive on fibers, and every point of `E` has a neighborhood whose translates
by the group elements are pairwise disjoint. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Quotient/Variant739f6c9693099484af1e57c47bb72cdf6d41d14e4dc05169eb083b6d47a03f38.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Quotient/Variant739f6c9693099484af1e57c47bb72cdf6d41d14e4dc05169eb083b6d47a03f38.lean#L36).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3348d2a4068c7336738a5f5144d377e4ea0847dd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
