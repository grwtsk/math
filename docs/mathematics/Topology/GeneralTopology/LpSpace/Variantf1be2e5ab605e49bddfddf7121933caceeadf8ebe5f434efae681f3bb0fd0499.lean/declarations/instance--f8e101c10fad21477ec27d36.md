## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6baa4a376cd6e2584ef5aa6bd1bb4df75c9dafa7c671b90a3c5b71c47a61df98`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 595–597.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [∀ i, Module 𝕜ᵐᵒᵖ (E i)] [∀ i, IsCentralScalar 𝕜 (E i)] : IsCentralScalar 𝕜 (lp E p) :=
  ⟨fun _ _ => Subtype.ext <| op_smul_eq_smul _ _⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LpSpace/Variantf1be2e5ab605e49bddfddf7121933caceeadf8ebe5f434efae681f3bb0fd0499.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LpSpace/Variantf1be2e5ab605e49bddfddf7121933caceeadf8ebe5f434efae681f3bb0fd0499.lean#L595).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `95065bf79d4606e53b195edd84b9761a1242ddcc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
