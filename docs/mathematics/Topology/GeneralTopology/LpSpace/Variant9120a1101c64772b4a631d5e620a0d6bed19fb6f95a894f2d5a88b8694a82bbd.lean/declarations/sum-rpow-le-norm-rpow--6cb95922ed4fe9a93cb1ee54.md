## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:21fd0358-5482-b966-3297-3fc8a22bf1db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 577–584.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sum_rpow_le_norm_rpow (hp : 0 < p.toReal) (f : lp E p) (s : Finset α) :
    ∑ i in s, ‖f i‖ ^ p.toReal ≤ ‖f‖ ^ p.toReal := by
  rw [lp.norm_rpow_eq_tsum hp f]
  have : ∀ i, 0 ≤ ‖f i‖ ^ p.toReal := fun i => Real.rpow_nonneg_of_nonneg (norm_nonneg _) _

  exact (lp.memℓp f).summable hp
#align lp.sum_rpow_le_norm_rpow lp.sum_rpow_le_norm_rpow

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LpSpace/Variant9120a1101c64772b4a631d5e620a0d6bed19fb6f95a894f2d5a88b8694a82bbd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LpSpace/Variant9120a1101c64772b4a631d5e620a0d6bed19fb6f95a894f2d5a88b8694a82bbd.lean#L577).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `050c3f648532b059f5db611c7736fbf6fc32faa0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
