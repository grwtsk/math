## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a9ac6a37-34e4-213b-2b88-9f877eebcb4e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 380–387.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem wellFoundedLT_of_chainHeight_ne_top (s : Set α) (hs : s.chainHeight ≠ ⊤) :
    WellFoundedLT s :=
  wellFoundedGT_of_chainHeight_ne_top (ofDual ⁻¹' s) <| by rwa [chainHeight_dual]
#align set.well_founded_lt_of_chain_height_ne_top Set.wellFoundedLT_of_chainHeight_ne_top

end Preorder

end Set
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Height/Variant2b05fc5d37a1bfc6fdaa35f39ec0c4fecb385ee0349fec0646911f0fe94088de.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Height/Variant2b05fc5d37a1bfc6fdaa35f39ec0c4fecb385ee0349fec0646911f0fe94088de.lean#L380).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b9e91d9826e1c6a06557f242ca2bca1374a91406` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
