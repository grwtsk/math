## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:497657d3-7f3a-0561-652e-41b897336399`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 483–489.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma apply_add_one_big_of_apply_small_of_N'aux_le {i : ℕ} (h : Small a (a i))
    (hN'aux : N'aux a N ≤ i) : Big a (a (i + 1)) := by
  have hN'' : N'aux a N < i + 1 := by omega
  suffices ¬Small a (a (i + 1)) by simpa [this] using hc.small_or_big_of_N'aux_lt hN''
  rw [hc.apply_add_one_eq_card (hc.N_lt_N'aux.le.trans hN'aux), Small, not_le]
  exact hc.k_lt_card_filter_eq_of_small_of_N'aux_le (hc.pos _) h hN''

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Imo2024Q3/Variant21c997c0234befb7a7783ceca76fa2712b32e59c0c60491ab06935b72fa3d89b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Imo2024Q3/Variant21c997c0234befb7a7783ceca76fa2712b32e59c0c60491ab06935b72fa3d89b.lean#L483).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3c11165dfa3919745c9b6bf989c565b8f58a342c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
