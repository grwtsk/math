## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a25d56500d8d622129cdd2e909dc9f5d7da0adf21276c0bf36719ad66234a2c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1024–1057.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def partialHomeomorph (e : PartialEquiv M H) (he : e ∈ c.atlas) :
    @PartialHomeomorph M H c.toTopologicalSpace _ :=
  { __ := c.toTopologicalSpace
    __ := e
    open_source := by convert c.open_source' he
    open_target := by convert c.open_target he
    continuousOn_toFun := by
      letI : TopologicalSpace M := c.toTopologicalSpace
      rw [continuousOn_open_iff (c.open_source' he)]
      intro s s_open
      rw [inter_comm]
      apply TopologicalSpace.GenerateOpen.basic
      simp only [exists_prop, mem_iUnion, mem_singleton_iff]
      exact ⟨e, he, ⟨s, s_open, rfl⟩⟩
    continuousOn_invFun := by
      letI : TopologicalSpace M := c.toTopologicalSpace
      apply continuousOn_isOpen_of_generateFrom
      intro t ht

      rcases ht with ⟨e', e'_atlas, s, s_open, ts⟩
      rw [ts]

      have : IsOpen (f ⁻¹' s ∩ f.source) := by
        simpa [f, inter_comm] using (continuousOn_open_iff (c.open_source e e' he e'_atlas)).1
          (c.continuousOn_toFun e e' he e'_atlas) s s_open
      have A : e' ∘ e.symm ⁻¹' s ∩ (e.target ∩ e.symm ⁻¹' e'.source) =
          e.target ∩ (e' ∘ e.symm ⁻¹' s ∩ e.symm ⁻¹' e'.source) := by

respect to the topology constructed from the atlas. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ChartedSpace/Variantb7b962587603bd1cdb10b41fb37abf2481546e05088de8a831ec1bfd3bcd345d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ChartedSpace/Variantb7b962587603bd1cdb10b41fb37abf2481546e05088de8a831ec1bfd3bcd345d.lean#L1024).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `74c23f180d2dede9651863f616ffa757b9c3dd0b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
