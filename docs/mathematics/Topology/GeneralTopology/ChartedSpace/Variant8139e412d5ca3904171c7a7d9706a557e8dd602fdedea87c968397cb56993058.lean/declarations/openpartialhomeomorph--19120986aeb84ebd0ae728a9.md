## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a587bc886e59b4bf5951c36b6851b95f5b8bf60a9f012ae57a7e02b0de4ae65d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 670–704.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def openPartialHomeomorph (e : PartialEquiv M H) (he : e ∈ c.atlas) :
    @OpenPartialHomeomorph M H c.toTopologicalSpace _ :=
  { __ := c.toTopologicalSpace
    __ := e
    open_source := by convert! c.open_source' he
    open_target := by convert! c.open_target he
    continuousOn_toFun := by
      let : TopologicalSpace M := c.toTopologicalSpace
      rw [continuousOn_open_iff (c.open_source' he)]
      intro s s_open
      rw [inter_comm]
      apply TopologicalSpace.GenerateOpen.basic
      simp only [exists_prop, mem_iUnion, mem_singleton_iff]
      exact ⟨e, he, ⟨s, s_open, rfl⟩⟩
    continuousOn_invFun := by
      let : TopologicalSpace M := c.toTopologicalSpace
      apply continuousOn_isOpen_of_generateFrom
      intro t ht
      simp only [exists_prop, mem_iUnion, mem_singleton_iff] at ht
      rcases ht with ⟨e', e'_atlas, s, s_open, ts⟩
      rw [ts]

      have : IsOpen (f ⁻¹' s ∩ f.source) := by
        simpa [f, inter_comm] using (continuousOn_open_iff (c.open_source e e' he e'_atlas)).1
          (c.continuousOn_toFun e e' he e'_atlas) s s_open
      have A : e' ∘ e.symm ⁻¹' s ∩ (e.target ∩ e.symm ⁻¹' e'.source) =
          e.target ∩ (e' ∘ e.symm ⁻¹' s ∩ e.symm ⁻¹' e'.source) := by

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ChartedSpace/Variant8139e412d5ca3904171c7a7d9706a557e8dd602fdedea87c968397cb56993058.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ChartedSpace/Variant8139e412d5ca3904171c7a7d9706a557e8dd602fdedea87c968397cb56993058.lean#L670).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `44a556dc586e598f467c7fe57c0da87ee2b18238` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
