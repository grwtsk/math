## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:177e5c0c6e5d066b704581ec453e74cc6f5f5bb68fa22989c07e8eed25c4ee99`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1153–1201.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    Structomorph G M M'' :=
  { Homeomorph.trans e.toHomeomorph e'.toHomeomorph with
    mem_groupoid := by
      /- Let c and c' be two charts in M and M''. We want to show that e' ∘ e is smooth in these
      charts, around any point x. For this, let y = e (c⁻¹ x), and consider a chart g around y.
      Then g ∘ e ∘ c⁻¹ and c' ∘ e' ∘ g⁻¹ are both smooth as e and e' are structomorphisms, so
      their composition is smooth, and it coincides with c' ∘ e' ∘ e ∘ c⁻¹ around x. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ChartedSpace/Variant2aecaca3b06b8468adda648ff3db269129ba9a2ea0337550aacced27194dfc69.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ChartedSpace/Variant2aecaca3b06b8468adda648ff3db269129ba9a2ea0337550aacced27194dfc69.lean#L1153).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `91624ebdd0ed1f3a60f24e3887b77235ae23ecb9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
