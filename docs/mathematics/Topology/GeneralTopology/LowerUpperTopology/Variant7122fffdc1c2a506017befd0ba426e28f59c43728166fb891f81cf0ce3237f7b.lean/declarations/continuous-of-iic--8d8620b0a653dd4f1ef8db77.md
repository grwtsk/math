## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:58808405-a227-c8eb-678c-c19d0d46d2e4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 426–438.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma continuous_of_Iic [TopologicalSpace β] {f : β → α} (h : ∀ a, IsClosed (f ⁻¹' (Iic a))) :
    Continuous f :=
  LowerTopology.continuous_of_Ici (α := αᵒᵈ) h

end Preorder


section PartialOrder

variable [PartialOrder α] [TopologicalSpace α] [UpperTopology α]

-- see Note [lower instance priority]
/-- The upper topology on a partial order is T₀. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LowerUpperTopology/Variant7122fffdc1c2a506017befd0ba426e28f59c43728166fb891f81cf0ce3237f7b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LowerUpperTopology/Variant7122fffdc1c2a506017befd0ba426e28f59c43728166fb891f81cf0ce3237f7b.lean#L426).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
