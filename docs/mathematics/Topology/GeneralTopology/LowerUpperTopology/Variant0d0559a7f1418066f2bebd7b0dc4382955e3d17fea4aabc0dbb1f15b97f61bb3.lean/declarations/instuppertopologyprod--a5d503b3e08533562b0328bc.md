## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:91e03e08a925963a0c8b904f2f6bd14dc9852edc80da208f88b533eda6f2dae7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 455–466.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instUpperTopologyProd [Preorder α] [TopologicalSpace α] [UpperTopology α] [OrderTop α]
    [Preorder β] [TopologicalSpace β] [UpperTopology β] [OrderTop β] : UpperTopology (α × β) where
  topology_eq_upperTopology := by
    suffices : LowerTopology (α × β)ᵒᵈ
    · exact LowerTopology.topology_eq_lowerTopology (α := (α × β)ᵒᵈ)
    exact instLowerTopologyProd (α := αᵒᵈ) (β := βᵒᵈ)

section CompleteLattice_LowerTopology

variable [CompleteLattice α] [CompleteLattice β] [TopologicalSpace α] [LowerTopology α]
  [TopologicalSpace β] [LowerTopology β]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LowerUpperTopology/Variant0d0559a7f1418066f2bebd7b0dc4382955e3d17fea4aabc0dbb1f15b97f61bb3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LowerUpperTopology/Variant0d0559a7f1418066f2bebd7b0dc4382955e3d17fea4aabc0dbb1f15b97f61bb3.lean#L455).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3353e08d41684890bae199a04f9db4f0f84fcb57` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
