## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:272cb9a9-984c-df9e-a951-c9c328271ada`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 264–271.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isLowerSet_of_isOpen (h : IsOpen s) : IsLowerSet s := by
  replace h := isOpen_iff_generate_Ici_compl.1 h
  induction h with
  | basic u h' => obtain ⟨a, rfl⟩ := h'; exact (isUpperSet_Ici a).compl
  | univ => exact isLowerSet_univ
  | inter u v _ _ hu2 hv2 => exact hu2.inter hv2
  | sUnion _ _ ih => exact isLowerSet_sUnion ih

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LowerUpperTopology/Variant78eed0f5a4dc2d9f16c5e0a92b3413ac350cf11fd19be8a68177b43bb4e4f323.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LowerUpperTopology/Variant78eed0f5a4dc2d9f16c5e0a92b3413ac350cf11fd19be8a68177b43bb4e4f323.lean#L264).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
