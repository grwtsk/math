## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:564fc0e8-301a-9fb1-2b59-4cc770099e9f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 51–61.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsCompact.uniformContinuousOn_of_continuous {s : Set α} {f : α → β} (hs : IsCompact s)
    (hf : ContinuousOn f s) : UniformContinuousOn f s := by
  rw [uniformContinuousOn_iff_restrict]
  rw [isCompact_iff_compactSpace] at hs
  rw [continuousOn_iff_continuous_restrict] at hf
  exact CompactSpace.uniformContinuous_of_continuous hf

/-- If `s` is compact and `f` is continuous at all points of `s`, then `f` is
"uniformly continuous at the set `s`", i.e. `f x` is close to `f y` whenever `x ∈ s` and `y` is
close to `x` (even if `y` is not itself in `s`, so this is a stronger assertion than
`UniformContinuousOn s`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/HeineCantor/Varianta651e4619986cf874f895b198c153f618fbccd4f6cc3ba54b932277486ab826e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/HeineCantor/Varianta651e4619986cf874f895b198c153f618fbccd4f6cc3ba54b932277486ab826e.lean#L51).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e1f3a2b8be3550e3e0a7a428c4615e184f342e72` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
