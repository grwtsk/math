## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0a55364b-3482-6eab-7a70-324fa26c0bda`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 102–111.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Continuous.tendstoUniformly [WeaklyLocallyCompactSpace α] [CompactSpace β] [UniformSpace γ]
    (f : α → β → γ) (h : Continuous ↿f) (x : α) : TendstoUniformly f (f x) (𝓝 x) :=
  let ⟨K, hK, hxK⟩ := exists_compact_mem_nhds x
  have : UniformContinuousOn (↿f) (K ×ˢ univ) :=
    IsCompact.uniformContinuousOn_of_continuous (hK.prod isCompact_univ) h.continuousOn
  this.tendstoUniformly hxK

/-- In a product space `α × β`, assume that a function `f` is continuous on `s × k` where `k` is
compact. Then, along the fiber above any `q ∈ s`, `f` is transversely uniformly continuous, i.e.,
if `p ∈ s` is close enough to `q`, then `f p x` is uniformly close to `f q x` for all `x ∈ k`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/HeineCantor/Variantb9f53f204954aa0c9365cee60cb6678cd6670d5966230af743cafd56f08a3b5e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/HeineCantor/Variantb9f53f204954aa0c9365cee60cb6678cd6670d5966230af743cafd56f08a3b5e.lean#L102).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9140cb9a687da21eae277578b7631f29c9165f07` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
