## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a6d0eab3-dc89-d130-4f48-5c5c12471d4b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 211–216.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coverEntropyInf_image_le_of_uniformContinuous [UniformSpace X] [UniformSpace Y] {S : X → X}
    {T : Y → Y} {φ : X → Y} (h : Semiconj φ S T) (h' : UniformContinuous φ) (F : Set X) :
    coverEntropyInf T (φ '' F) ≤ coverEntropyInf S F := by
  rw [coverEntropyInf_image_of_comap _ h F]
  exact coverEntropyInf_antitone S F (uniformContinuous_iff_le_comap.1 h')

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Semiconj/Variant5dbc67709e48ce5d3c207464ece7f4cd5bdb93a8835f777622b6a3323abb1358.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Semiconj/Variant5dbc67709e48ce5d3c207464ece7f4cd5bdb93a8835f777622b6a3323abb1358.lean#L211).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `79b88bf66e50b5bff3b6ebe89ef4ae307b11c6d5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
