## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:24421f485ba80d4e3925adc989e9dce274db2e56767cbf067c3a93efc6aea883`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 74–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance IsUltraUniformity.pi {ι : Type*} {X : ι → Type*} [U : Π i, UniformSpace (X i)]
    [h : ∀ i, IsUltraUniformity (X i)] :
    IsUltraUniformity (Π i, X i) := by
  suffices @IsUltraUniformity _ (⨅ i, UniformSpace.comap (Function.eval i) (U i)) by
    simpa [Pi.uniformSpace_eq _] using this
  exact .iInf fun i ↦ .comap (h i) (Function.eval i)
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Constructions/Variant2055884b706e8a971da56096bf3daf64e08575b95af21cab400714221c673f92.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Constructions/Variant2055884b706e8a971da56096bf3daf64e08575b95af21cab400714221c673f92.lean#L74).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1c0c1102bfaa15dc0d17eb987968959a4fd87855` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
