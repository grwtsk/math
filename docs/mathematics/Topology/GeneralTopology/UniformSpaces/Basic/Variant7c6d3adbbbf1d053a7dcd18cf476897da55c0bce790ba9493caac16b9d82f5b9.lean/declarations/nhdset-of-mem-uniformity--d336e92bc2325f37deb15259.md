## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e61bb704-fcc0-a83b-ac2a-1b36ffd4ff31`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    ∃ t : Set (α × α), IsOpen t ∧ s ⊆ t ∧
      t ⊆ { p | ∃ x y, (p.1, x) ∈ d ∧ (x, y) ∈ s ∧ (y, p.2) ∈ d } := by
  let cl_d := { p : α × α | ∃ x y, (p.1, x) ∈ d ∧ (x, y) ∈ s ∧ (y, p.2) ∈ d }
  have : ∀ p ∈ s, ∃ t, t ⊆ cl_d ∧ IsOpen t ∧ p ∈ t := fun ⟨x, y⟩ hp =>

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Basic/Variant7c6d3adbbbf1d053a7dcd18cf476897da55c0bce790ba9493caac16b9d82f5b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Basic/Variant7c6d3adbbbf1d053a7dcd18cf476897da55c0bce790ba9493caac16b9d82f5b9.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e0505f4c40fa377aa97d85a26c412b9decac6dfb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
