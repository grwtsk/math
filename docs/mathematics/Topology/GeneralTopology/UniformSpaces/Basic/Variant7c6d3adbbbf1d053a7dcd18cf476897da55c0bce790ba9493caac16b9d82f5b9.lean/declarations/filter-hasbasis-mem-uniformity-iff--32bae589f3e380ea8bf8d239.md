## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5c63ffdf-96ee-bc05-8365-a8da7ab7d350`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 269–275.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Filter.HasBasis.mem_uniformity_iff {p : β → Prop} {s : β → Set (α × α)}
    (h : (𝓤 α).HasBasis p s) {t : Set (α × α)} :
    t ∈ 𝓤 α ↔ ∃ i, p i ∧ ∀ a b, (a, b) ∈ s i → (a, b) ∈ t :=
  h.mem_iff.trans <| by simp only [Prod.forall, subset_def]

/-- Open elements `s : Set (α × α)` of `𝓤 α` such that `(x, y) ∈ s ↔ (y, x) ∈ s` form a basis
of `𝓤 α`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Basic/Variant7c6d3adbbbf1d053a7dcd18cf476897da55c0bce790ba9493caac16b9d82f5b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Basic/Variant7c6d3adbbbf1d053a7dcd18cf476897da55c0bce790ba9493caac16b9d82f5b9.lean#L269).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e0505f4c40fa377aa97d85a26c412b9decac6dfb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
