## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8fa103f8-cb9b-4b5e-fddf-a050ac89b297`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 519–523.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem uniformContinuous_sInf_rng {f : α → β} {u₁ : UniformSpace α} {u₂ : Set (UniformSpace β)} :
    UniformContinuous[u₁, sInf u₂] f ↔ ∀ u ∈ u₂, UniformContinuous[u₁, u] f := by
  delta UniformContinuous
  rw [sInf_eq_iInf', iInf_uniformity, tendsto_iInf, SetCoe.forall]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Basic/Variant5ae83779595b586d778403507894af21ff64111723322afa63d32d1a6c14dbe6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Basic/Variant5ae83779595b586d778403507894af21ff64111723322afa63d32d1a6c14dbe6.lean#L519).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2ef169b1cee415481d609f5882d80f61e629ae56` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
