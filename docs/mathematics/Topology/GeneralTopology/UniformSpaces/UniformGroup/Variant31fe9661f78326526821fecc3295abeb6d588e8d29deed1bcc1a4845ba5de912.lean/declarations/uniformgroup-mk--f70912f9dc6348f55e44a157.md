## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c21fb5f0-e984-b55b-b8d3-f5e70450cec7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 72–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem UniformGroup.mk' {α} [UniformSpace α] [Group α]
    (h₁ : UniformContinuous fun p : α × α => p.1 * p.2) (h₂ : UniformContinuous fun p : α => p⁻¹) :
    UniformGroup α :=
  ⟨by simpa only [div_eq_mul_inv] using
    h₁.comp (uniformContinuous_fst.prod_mk (h₂.comp uniformContinuous_snd))⟩
#align uniform_group.mk' UniformGroup.mk'
#align uniform_add_group.mk' UniformAddGroup.mk'

variable [UniformSpace α] [Group α] [UniformGroup α]

@[to_additive]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformGroup/Variant31fe9661f78326526821fecc3295abeb6d588e8d29deed1bcc1a4845ba5de912.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformGroup/Variant31fe9661f78326526821fecc3295abeb6d588e8d29deed1bcc1a4845ba5de912.lean#L72).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9806d296e7fa4c77a4cb143734ab3e4a722b7f06` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
