## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bc625374d8c32a6a0caf36c7571f5f91cf9619d24c51652f07ff9b39c30ee4b1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 999–1007.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance QuotientGroup.completeSpace (G : Type u) [Group G] [us : UniformSpace G] [UniformGroup G]
    [FirstCountableTopology G] (N : Subgroup G) [N.Normal] [hG : CompleteSpace G] :
    @CompleteSpace (G ⧸ N) (TopologicalGroup.toUniformSpace (G ⧸ N)) := by
  rw [← @UniformGroup.toUniformSpace_eq _ us _ _] at hG
  infer_instance
#align quotient_group.complete_space QuotientGroup.completeSpace
#align quotient_add_group.complete_space QuotientAddGroup.completeSpace

end CompleteQuotient
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformGroup/Variantb225b0d4047d42bc231d6efb8aa28efff55a2c48f5c499709a8ef862caa08e98.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformGroup/Variantb225b0d4047d42bc231d6efb8aa28efff55a2c48f5c499709a8ef862caa08e98.lean#L999).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `19f2ebd7d1069acb49ff5a0586dc631204f30576` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
