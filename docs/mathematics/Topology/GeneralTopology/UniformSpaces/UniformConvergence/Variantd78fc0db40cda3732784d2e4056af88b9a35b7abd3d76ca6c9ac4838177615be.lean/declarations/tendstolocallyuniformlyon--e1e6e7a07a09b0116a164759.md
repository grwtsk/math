## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ff8c06f251dca14b2a47860f334eb9598243c78bae038e265f00edc04b8324eb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 593–599.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def TendstoLocallyUniformlyOn (F : ι → α → β) (f : α → β) (p : Filter ι) (s : Set α) :=
  ∀ u ∈ 𝓤 β, ∀ x ∈ s, ∃ t ∈ 𝓝[s] x, ∀ᶠ n in p, ∀ y ∈ t, (f y, F n y) ∈ u
#align tendsto_locally_uniformly_on TendstoLocallyUniformlyOn

/-- A sequence of functions `Fₙ` converges locally uniformly to a limiting function `f` with respect
to a filter `p` if, for any entourage of the diagonal `u`, for any `x`, one has `p`-eventually
`(f y, Fₙ y) ∈ u` for all `y` in a neighborhood of `x`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variantd78fc0db40cda3732784d2e4056af88b9a35b7abd3d76ca6c9ac4838177615be.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variantd78fc0db40cda3732784d2e4056af88b9a35b7abd3d76ca6c9ac4838177615be.lean#L593).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `67fdd99294a7682219834479151f3c026e6e5eed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
