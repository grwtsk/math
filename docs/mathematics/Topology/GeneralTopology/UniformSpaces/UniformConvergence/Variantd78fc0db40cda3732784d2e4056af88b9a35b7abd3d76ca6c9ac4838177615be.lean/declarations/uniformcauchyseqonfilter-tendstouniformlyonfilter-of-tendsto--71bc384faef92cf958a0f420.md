## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5c57051e-ae01-d7a8-515e-9a6a90e14ccf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 439–468.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (hF' : ∀ᶠ x : α in p', Tendsto (fun n => F n x) p (𝓝 (f x))) :
    TendstoUniformlyOnFilter F f p p' := by
  -- Proof idea: |f_n(x) - f(x)| ≤ |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| + |f_m(x) - f(x)|. We choose `n`
  -- so that |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| is uniformly small across `s` whenever `m ≥ n`. Then for
  -- a fixed `x`, we choose `m` sufficiently large such that |f_m(x) - f(x)| is small.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variantd78fc0db40cda3732784d2e4056af88b9a35b7abd3d76ca6c9ac4838177615be.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variantd78fc0db40cda3732784d2e4056af88b9a35b7abd3d76ca6c9ac4838177615be.lean#L439).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `67fdd99294a7682219834479151f3c026e6e5eed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
