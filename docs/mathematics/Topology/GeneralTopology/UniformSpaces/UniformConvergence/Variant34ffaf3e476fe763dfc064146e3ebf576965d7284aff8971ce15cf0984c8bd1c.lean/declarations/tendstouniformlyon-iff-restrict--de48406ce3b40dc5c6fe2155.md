## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:316c71b7-f80f-f431-d3dc-3c474bfbe5b6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 142–149.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma tendstoUniformlyOn_iff_restrict {K : Set α} : TendstoUniformlyOn F f p K ↔
    TendstoUniformly (fun n : ι => K.domRestrict (F n)) (K.domRestrict f) p :=
  tendstoUniformlyOn_iff_tendstoUniformly_comp_coe

/-- A sequence of functions `Fₙ` converges uniformly to a limiting function `f` w.r.t.
filter `p` iff the function `(n, x) ↦ (f x, Fₙ x)` converges along `p ×ˢ ⊤` to the uniformity.
In other words: one knows nothing about the behavior of `x` in this limit.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variant34ffaf3e476fe763dfc064146e3ebf576965d7284aff8971ce15cf0984c8bd1c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variant34ffaf3e476fe763dfc064146e3ebf576965d7284aff8971ce15cf0984c8bd1c.lean#L142).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3dd1a950ccbf086c7b365c0d709c403e012d04b0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
