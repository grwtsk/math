## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d45f9e46-a030-19d9-05fa-9be8f991f1ea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 220–226.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem TendstoUniformlyOn.congr_inseparable_right {g : α → β} (hf : TendstoUniformlyOn F f p s)
    (hfg : ∀ x ∈ s, Inseparable (f x) (g x)) : TendstoUniformlyOn F g p s := by
  rw [tendstoUniformlyOn_iff_tendsto, uniformity_hasBasis_open.tendsto_right_iff] at hf ⊢
  refine forall₂_imp (fun i hi hf => ?_) hf
  rw [eventually_prod_principal_iff] at hf ⊢
  exact hf.mono fun x hx y hy => (((hfg y hy).prod .rfl).mem_open_iff hi.2).mp (hx y hy)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variant34ffaf3e476fe763dfc064146e3ebf576965d7284aff8971ce15cf0984c8bd1c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variant34ffaf3e476fe763dfc064146e3ebf576965d7284aff8971ce15cf0984c8bd1c.lean#L220).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3dd1a950ccbf086c7b365c0d709c403e012d04b0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
