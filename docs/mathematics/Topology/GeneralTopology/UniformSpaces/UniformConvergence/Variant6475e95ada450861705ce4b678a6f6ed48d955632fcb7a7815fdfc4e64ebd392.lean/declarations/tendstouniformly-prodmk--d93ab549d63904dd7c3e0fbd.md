## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b713970f-98c9-c58e-7399-75591e23db3e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 290–299.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem TendstoUniformly.prodMk {ι' β' : Type*} [UniformSpace β'] {F' : ι' → α → β'} {f' : α → β'}
    {p' : Filter ι'} (h : TendstoUniformly F f p) (h' : TendstoUniformly F' f' p') :
    TendstoUniformly (fun (i : ι × ι') a => (F i.1 a, F' i.2 a)) (fun a => (f a, f' a)) (p ×ˢ p') :=
  (h.prodMap h').comp fun a => (a, a)

@[deprecated (since := "2025-03-10")]
alias TendstoUniformly.prod := TendstoUniformly.prodMk

/-- Uniform convergence on a filter `p'` to a constant function is equivalent to convergence in
`p ×ˢ p'`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variant6475e95ada450861705ce4b678a6f6ed48d955632fcb7a7815fdfc4e64ebd392.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variant6475e95ada450861705ce4b678a6f6ed48d955632fcb7a7815fdfc4e64ebd392.lean#L290).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e25f3cc619dcb97fcc87aeafa5e2ca9b374aed6a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
