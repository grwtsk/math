## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:86e70c5a-9aff-0d21-6944-79f7b9adc87a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 562–567.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem TendstoUniformly.tendsto_of_eventually_tendsto
    (h1 : TendstoUniformly F f p) (h2 : ∀ᶠ i in p, Tendsto (F i) p' (𝓝 (L i)))
    (h3 : Tendsto L p (𝓝 ℓ)) : Tendsto f p' (𝓝 ℓ) :=
  (h1.tendstoUniformlyOnFilter.mono_right le_top).tendsto_of_eventually_tendsto h2 h3

end
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variant6475e95ada450861705ce4b678a6f6ed48d955632fcb7a7815fdfc4e64ebd392.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variant6475e95ada450861705ce4b678a6f6ed48d955632fcb7a7815fdfc4e64ebd392.lean#L562).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e25f3cc619dcb97fcc87aeafa5e2ca9b374aed6a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
