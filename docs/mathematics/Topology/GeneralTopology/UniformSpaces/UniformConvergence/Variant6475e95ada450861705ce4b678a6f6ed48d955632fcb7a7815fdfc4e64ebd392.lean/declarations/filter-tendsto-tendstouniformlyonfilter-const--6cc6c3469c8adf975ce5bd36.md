## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bf01fd2c-cb84-aed1-a119-ee812e6b1d6c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 329–335.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Filter.Tendsto.tendstoUniformlyOnFilter_const {g : ι → β} {b : β} (hg : Tendsto g p (𝓝 b))
    (p' : Filter α) :
    TendstoUniformlyOnFilter (fun n : ι => fun _ : α => g n) (fun _ : α => b) p p' := by
  simpa only [nhds_eq_comap_uniformity, tendsto_comap_iff] using hg.comp (tendsto_fst (g := p'))

/-- If a sequence `g` converges to some `b`, then the sequence of constant functions
`fun n ↦ fun a ↦ g n` converges to the constant function `fun a ↦ b` on any set `s` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variant6475e95ada450861705ce4b678a6f6ed48d955632fcb7a7815fdfc4e64ebd392.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variant6475e95ada450861705ce4b678a6f6ed48d955632fcb7a7815fdfc4e64ebd392.lean#L329).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e25f3cc619dcb97fcc87aeafa5e2ca9b374aed6a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
