## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4ed9564e-bab7-33d4-7db3-7396ce15e07c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 374–384.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem TendstoUniformlyOnFilter.uniformCauchySeqOnFilter (hF : TendstoUniformlyOnFilter F f p p') :
    UniformCauchySeqOnFilter F p p' := by
  intro u hu
  rcases comp_symm_of_uniformity hu with ⟨t, ht, htsymm, htmem⟩
  have := tendsto_swap4_prod.eventually ((hF t ht).prod_mk (hF t ht))
  apply this.diag_of_prod_right.mono
  simp only [and_imp, Prod.forall]
  intro n1 n2 x hl hr
  exact Set.mem_of_mem_of_subset (prodMk_mem_compRel (htsymm hl) hr) htmem

/-- A sequence that converges uniformly is also uniformly Cauchy -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variant0993d493a9d482b94496ff61dda12f628c50db256aa66100796945eb95f751d3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergence/Variant0993d493a9d482b94496ff61dda12f628c50db256aa66100796945eb95f751d3.lean#L374).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f98f56c79a806af72290ec5f7605a92f191e5ad3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
