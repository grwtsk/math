## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:deef28522f7882324b555b2ad682b38a0f1173906b074f86bda522a5b0cc7e5b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 976–987.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) PseudoMetricSpace.toPseudoEMetricSpace : PseudoEMetricSpace α :=
  { ‹PseudoMetricSpace α› with
    edist_self := by simp [edist_dist]
    edist_comm := fun _ _ => by simp only [edist_dist, dist_comm]
    edist_triangle := fun x y z => by
      simp only [edist_dist, ← ENNReal.ofReal_add, dist_nonneg]
      rw [ENNReal.ofReal_le_ofReal_iff _]
      · exact dist_triangle _ _ _
      · simpa using add_le_add (dist_nonneg : 0 ≤ dist x y) dist_nonneg
    uniformity_edist := Metric.uniformity_edist }

/-- In a pseudometric space, an open ball of infinite radius is the whole space -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Defs/Variant13cd9bc80e44bf7b61a55b5b1c2993058ac995f8803a6fb58c230c23a1d0fa35.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Defs/Variant13cd9bc80e44bf7b61a55b5b1c2993058ac995f8803a6fb58c230c23a1d0fa35.lean#L976).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `912bc464320d8ea70f002255c59e9f79d41f6ac2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
