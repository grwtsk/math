## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2a418d4d-2465-d59f-0da0-33411723b1e8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 790–792.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem uniformContinuous_const [UniformSpace β] {b : β} : UniformContinuous fun _ : α => b :=
  uniformContinuous_of_const fun _ _ => rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Defs/Variant07508ec56c9bb018f6da1dd08f0fa894aa8bf76eb80ba20aa422112b9249ffe9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Defs/Variant07508ec56c9bb018f6da1dd08f0fa894aa8bf76eb80ba20aa422112b9249ffe9.lean#L790).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1a802f9c93d7c3ba70440448f5cb8b5bd1512a30` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
