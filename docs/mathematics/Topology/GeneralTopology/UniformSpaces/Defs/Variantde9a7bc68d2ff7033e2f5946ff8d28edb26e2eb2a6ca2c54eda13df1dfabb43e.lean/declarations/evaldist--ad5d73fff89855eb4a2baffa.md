## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4d321445e09ea7b8954175b95109f51817158542582e5305d8d1feed769d0057`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 269–279.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
meta def evalDist : PositivityExt where eval {u α} _zα pα? e :=
  match pα? with | none => pure .none | some _ => do
  match u, α, e with
  | 0, ~q(ℝ), ~q(@Dist.dist $β $inst $a $b) =>
    let _inst ← synthInstanceQ q(PseudoMetricSpace $β)
    assertInstancesCommute
    pure (.nonnegative q(dist_nonneg))
  | _, _, _ => throwError "not dist"

end Mathlib.Meta.Positivity

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Defs/Variantde9a7bc68d2ff7033e2f5946ff8d28edb26e2eb2a6ca2c54eda13df1dfabb43e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Defs/Variantde9a7bc68d2ff7033e2f5946ff8d28edb26e2eb2a6ca2c54eda13df1dfabb43e.lean#L269).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a1302b6c82c9cd028793f6cad50230b5fbe3a5b7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
