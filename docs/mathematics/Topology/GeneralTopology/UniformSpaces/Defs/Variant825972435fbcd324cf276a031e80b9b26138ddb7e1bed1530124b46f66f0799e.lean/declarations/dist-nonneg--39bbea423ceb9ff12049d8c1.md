## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f83d177d-383a-b9c4-23bd-ae6b824b606d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 93–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- A pseudometric space is a type endowed with a `ℝ`-valued distance `dist` satisfying
reflexivity `dist x x = 0`, commutativity `dist x y = dist y x`, and the triangle inequality
`dist x z ≤ dist x y + dist y z`.

Note that we do not require `dist x y = 0 → x = y`. See metric spaces (`MetricSpace`) for the
similar class with that stronger assumption.

Any pseudometric space is a topological space and a uniform space (see `TopologicalSpace`,
`UniformSpace`), where the topology and uniformity come from the metric.
Note that a T1 pseudometric space is just a metric space.

We make the uniformity/topology part of the data instead of deriving it from the metric. This eg
ensures that we do not get a diamond when doing
`[PseudoMetricSpace α] [PseudoMetricSpace β] : TopologicalSpace (α × β)`:
The product metric and product topology agree, but not definitionally so.
See Note [forgetful inheritance]. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Defs/Variant825972435fbcd324cf276a031e80b9b26138ddb7e1bed1530124b46f66f0799e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Defs/Variant825972435fbcd324cf276a031e80b9b26138ddb7e1bed1530124b46f66f0799e.lean#L93).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5d0e6da2c77245966a3fa5c4356ba79581daaa14` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
