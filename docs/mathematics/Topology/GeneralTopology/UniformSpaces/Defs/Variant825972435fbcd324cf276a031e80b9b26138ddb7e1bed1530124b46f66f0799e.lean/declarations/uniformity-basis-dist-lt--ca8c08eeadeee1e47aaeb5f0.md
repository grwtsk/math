## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c15aa6de-5e8a-ed41-62dc-a6c2125f0ac2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 657–668.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem uniformity_basis_dist_lt {R : ℝ} (hR : 0 < R) :
    (𝓤 α).HasBasis (fun r : ℝ => 0 < r ∧ r < R) fun r => { p : α × α | dist p.1 p.2 < r } :=
  Metric.mk_uniformity_basis (fun _ => And.left) fun r hr =>
    ⟨min r (R / 2), ⟨lt_min hr (half_pos hR), min_lt_iff.2 <| Or.inr (half_lt_self hR)⟩,
      min_le_left _ _⟩

/-- Given `f : β → ℝ`, if `f` sends `{i | p i}` to a set of positive numbers
accumulating to zero, then closed neighborhoods of the diagonal of sizes `{f i | p i}`
form a basis of `𝓤 α`.

Currently we have only one specific basis `uniformity_basis_dist_le` based on this constructor.
More can be easily added if needed in the future. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Defs/Variant825972435fbcd324cf276a031e80b9b26138ddb7e1bed1530124b46f66f0799e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Defs/Variant825972435fbcd324cf276a031e80b9b26138ddb7e1bed1530124b46f66f0799e.lean#L657).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5d0e6da2c77245966a3fa5c4356ba79581daaa14` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
