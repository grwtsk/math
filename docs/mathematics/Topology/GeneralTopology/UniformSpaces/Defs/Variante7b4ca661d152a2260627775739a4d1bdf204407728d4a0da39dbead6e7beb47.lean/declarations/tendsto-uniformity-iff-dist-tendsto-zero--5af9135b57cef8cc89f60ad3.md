## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5b4a3e2f-14f4-5e5c-63f0-8f4435c0d741`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1093–1096.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_uniformity_iff_dist_tendsto_zero {f : ι → α × α} {p : Filter ι} :
    Tendsto f p (𝓤 α) ↔ Tendsto (fun x => dist (f x).1 (f x).2) p (𝓝 0) := by
  rw [Metric.uniformity_eq_comap_nhds_zero, tendsto_comap_iff, Function.comp_def]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Defs/Variante7b4ca661d152a2260627775739a4d1bdf204407728d4a0da39dbead6e7beb47.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Defs/Variante7b4ca661d152a2260627775739a4d1bdf204407728d4a0da39dbead6e7beb47.lean#L1093).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d67fcb197e4a2658ac3da9ee76ba8f99572ba50f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
