## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0fee7e8164422803a637139b4e65665e52f82690972344d0aca2ed1564fa624d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 66–95.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure AbstractCompletion.{v, u} (α : Type u) [UniformSpace α] where
  /-- The underlying space of the completion. -/
  space : Type v
  /-- A map from a space to its completion. -/
  coe : α → space
  /-- The completion carries a uniform structure. -/
  uniformStruct : UniformSpace space
  /-- The completion is complete. -/
  complete : CompleteSpace space
  /-- The completion is a T₀ space. -/
  separation : T0Space space
  /-- The map into the completion is uniform-inducing. -/
  isUniformInducing : IsUniformInducing coe
  /-- The map into the completion has dense range. -/
  dense : DenseRange coe

attribute [local instance]
  AbstractCompletion.uniformStruct AbstractCompletion.complete AbstractCompletion.separation

namespace AbstractCompletion

universe uα vα vα' uβ vβ uγ vγ

variable {α : Type uα} [UniformSpace α] (pkg : AbstractCompletion.{vα} α)

local notation "hatα" => pkg.space

local notation "ι" => pkg.coe

/-- If `α` is complete, then it is an abstract completion of itself. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/AbstractCompletion/Variant43c4ab7d13042ccd9d2c996842043d0868df1b261982f2e3702226ec644df43b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/AbstractCompletion/Variant43c4ab7d13042ccd9d2c996842043d0868df1b261982f2e3702226ec644df43b.lean#L66).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `55f93e66b140eb952949ec72a21d01b50c951af0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
