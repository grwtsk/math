## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2c7f5a02-dcb1-0be7-1ae0-a794b8469994`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 123–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem comp_gen : (((𝓤 α).lift' gen).lift' fun s => compRel s s) ≤ (𝓤 α).lift' gen :=
  calc
    (((𝓤 α).lift' gen).lift' fun s => compRel s s) =
        (𝓤 α).lift' fun s => compRel (gen s) (gen s) := by
      rw [lift'_lift'_assoc]
      · exact monotone_gen
      · exact monotone_id.compRel monotone_id
    _ ≤ (𝓤 α).lift' fun s => gen <| compRel s s :=
      lift'_mono' fun s _hs => compRel_gen_gen_subset_gen_compRel
    _ = ((𝓤 α).lift' fun s : Set (α × α) => compRel s s).lift' gen := by
      rw [lift'_lift'_assoc]
      · exact monotone_id.compRel monotone_id
      · exact monotone_gen
    _ ≤ (𝓤 α).lift' gen := lift'_mono comp_le_uniformity le_rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Completion/Variant593d7afd57ce7907e856c6b7b91e4f2cd847f666ca2e20c9ccd3dde365f75603.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Completion/Variant593d7afd57ce7907e856c6b7b91e4f2cd847f666ca2e20c9ccd3dde365f75603.lean#L123).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c21e3d20d856d012ba3fe008d8697ba7a98b7d73` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
