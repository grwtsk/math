## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a611cc99-d937-c579-ed55-a07dc3e95391`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 314–325.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem equicontinuousWithinAt_iff_pair {F : ι → X → α} {S : Set X} {x₀ : X} (hx₀ : x₀ ∈ S) :
    EquicontinuousWithinAt F S x₀ ↔

  · rcases comp_symm_mem_uniformity_sets hU with ⟨V, hV, hVsymm, hVU⟩
    refine ⟨_, H V hV, fun x hx y hy i => hVU (SetRel.prodMk_mem_comp ?_ (hy i))⟩
    exact SetRel.symm V (hx i)
  · rcases H U hU with ⟨V, hV, hVU⟩
    filter_upwards [hV] using fun x hx i => hVU x₀ (mem_of_mem_nhdsWithin hx₀ hV) x hx i

/-- Reformulation of equicontinuity at `x₀` comparing two variables near `x₀` instead of comparing
only one with `x₀`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Equicontinuity/Varianteed9728a15e729914a66423273f4c597004b29ea55682ee7f6f091b3d46afb87.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Equicontinuity/Varianteed9728a15e729914a66423273f4c597004b29ea55682ee7f6f091b3d46afb87.lean#L314).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2cebb90f29c64713bedbc4cc0bf92eaa51283531` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
