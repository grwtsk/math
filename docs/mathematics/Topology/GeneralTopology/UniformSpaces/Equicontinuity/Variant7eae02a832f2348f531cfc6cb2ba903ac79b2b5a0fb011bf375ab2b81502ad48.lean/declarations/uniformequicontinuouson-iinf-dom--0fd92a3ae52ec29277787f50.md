## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cdea2890-72e6-268a-a199-fb21a7690bcb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 605–612.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem uniformEquicontinuousOn_iInf_dom {u : κ → UniformSpace β'} {F : ι → β' → α}
    {S : Set β'} {k : κ} (hk : UniformEquicontinuousOn (uβ := u k) F S) :
    UniformEquicontinuousOn (uβ := ⨅ k, u k) F S := by
  simp_rw [uniformEquicontinuousOn_iff_uniformContinuousOn (uβ := _)] at hk ⊢
  unfold UniformContinuousOn
  rw [iInf_uniformity]
  exact hk.mono_left <| inf_le_inf_right _ <| iInf_le _ k

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Equicontinuity/Variant7eae02a832f2348f531cfc6cb2ba903ac79b2b5a0fb011bf375ab2b81502ad48.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Equicontinuity/Variant7eae02a832f2348f531cfc6cb2ba903ac79b2b5a0fb011bf375ab2b81502ad48.lean#L605).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `edeaa023f7615f9fc86899e670c1d0041a24cd10` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
