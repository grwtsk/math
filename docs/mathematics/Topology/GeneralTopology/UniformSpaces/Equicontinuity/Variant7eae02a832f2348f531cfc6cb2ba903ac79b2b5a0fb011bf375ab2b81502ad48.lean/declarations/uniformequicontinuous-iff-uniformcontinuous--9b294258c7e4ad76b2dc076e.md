## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e3d0a367-1b33-cb50-c3f9-b8d6c769904c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 527–535.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem uniformEquicontinuous_iff_uniformContinuous {F : ι → β → α} :
    UniformEquicontinuous F ↔ UniformContinuous (ofFun ∘ Function.swap F : β → ι →ᵤ α) := by
  rw [UniformContinuous, (UniformFun.hasBasis_uniformity ι α).tendsto_right_iff]
  rfl

/-- A family `𝓕 : ι → β → α` is uniformly equicontinuous on `S` iff the function
`swap 𝓕 : β → ι → α` is uniformly continuous on `S`
*when `ι → α` is equipped with the uniform structure of uniform convergence*. This is very useful
for developing the equicontinuity API, but it should not be used directly for other purposes. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Equicontinuity/Variant7eae02a832f2348f531cfc6cb2ba903ac79b2b5a0fb011bf375ab2b81502ad48.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Equicontinuity/Variant7eae02a832f2348f531cfc6cb2ba903ac79b2b5a0fb011bf375ab2b81502ad48.lean#L527).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `edeaa023f7615f9fc86899e670c1d0041a24cd10` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
