## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:84708c1f8cd6179eb134d3467e26b9b8467f52a2211e79c5a4b505f9f86d63ce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 134–139.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected abbrev Set.EquicontinuousOn (H : Set <| X → α) (S : Set X) : Prop :=
  EquicontinuousOn ((↑) : H → X → α) S

/-- A family `F : ι → β → α` of functions between uniform spaces is *uniformly equicontinuous* if,
for all entourages `U ∈ 𝓤 α`, there is an entourage `V ∈ 𝓤 β` such that, whenever `x` and `y` are
`V`-close, we have that, *for all `i : ι`*, `F i x` is `U`-close to `F i y`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Equicontinuity/Variant5473a2d34367dfc09f52602d6ca97d4c59e8c28c26bd3535e84f52bf9b70b40a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Equicontinuity/Variant5473a2d34367dfc09f52602d6ca97d4c59e8c28c26bd3535e84f52bf9b70b40a.lean#L134).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `48fa4eba65d381f5e61ad0a9e10d755c06d02b2d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
