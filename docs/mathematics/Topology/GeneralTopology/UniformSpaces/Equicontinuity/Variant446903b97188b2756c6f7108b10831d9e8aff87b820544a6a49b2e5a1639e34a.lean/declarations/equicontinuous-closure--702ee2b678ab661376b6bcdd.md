## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7c57151b-dd40-ae40-cd14-56f8112ba536`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 807–815.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Equicontinuous.closure' {A : Set Y} {u : Y → X → α}
    (hA : Equicontinuous (u ∘ (↑) : A → X → α)) (hu : Continuous u) :
    Equicontinuous (u ∘ (↑) : closure A → X → α) := fun x ↦ (hA x).closure' hu

/-- If a set of functions is equicontinuous on a set `S`, the same is true for its closure in *any*
topology for which evaluation at any `x ∈ S` is continuous. Since this will be applied to
`DFunLike` types, we state it for any topological space with a map to `X → α` satisfying the right
continuity conditions. See also `Set.EquicontinuousOn.closure` for a more familiar
(but weaker) statement. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Equicontinuity/Variant446903b97188b2756c6f7108b10831d9e8aff87b820544a6a49b2e5a1639e34a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Equicontinuity/Variant446903b97188b2756c6f7108b10831d9e8aff87b820544a6a49b2e5a1639e34a.lean#L807).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fc7b2e8d7367ebd0e1b957b6d6402ec15a662f5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
