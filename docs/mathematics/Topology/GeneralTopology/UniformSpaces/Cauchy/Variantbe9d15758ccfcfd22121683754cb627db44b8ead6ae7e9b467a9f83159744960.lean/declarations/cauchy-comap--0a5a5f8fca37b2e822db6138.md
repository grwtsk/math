## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:feeb96f3-eba8-7946-fc82-d13b4801d205`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 195–203.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (hm : Filter.comap (fun p : α × α => (m p.1, m p.2)) (𝓤 β) ≤ 𝓤 α)

#align cauchy.comap' Cauchy.comap'

/-- Cauchy sequences. Usually defined on ℕ, but often it is also useful to say that a function
defined on ℝ is Cauchy at +∞ to deduce convergence. Therefore, we define it in a type class that
is general enough to cover both ℕ and ℝ, which are the main motivating examples. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Cauchy/Variantbe9d15758ccfcfd22121683754cb627db44b8ead6ae7e9b467a9f83159744960.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Cauchy/Variantbe9d15758ccfcfd22121683754cb627db44b8ead6ae7e9b467a9f83159744960.lean#L195).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8d844b674942d472920dc2e03d2c80465cc96dfd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
