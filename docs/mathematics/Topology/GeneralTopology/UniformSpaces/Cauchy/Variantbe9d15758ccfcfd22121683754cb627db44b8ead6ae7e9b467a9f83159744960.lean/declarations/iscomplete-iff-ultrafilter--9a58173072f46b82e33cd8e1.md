## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:75715cf1-773f-7ecf-835e-7a70b7db11d2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 361–368.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isComplete_iff_ultrafilter {s : Set α} :
    IsComplete s ↔ ∀ l : Ultrafilter α, Cauchy (l : Filter α) → ↑l ≤ 𝓟 s → ∃ x ∈ s, ↑l ≤ 𝓝 x := by
  refine' ⟨fun h l => h l, fun H => isComplete_iff_clusterPt.2 fun l hl hls => _⟩
  haveI := hl.1
  rcases H (Ultrafilter.of l) hl.ultrafilter_of ((Ultrafilter.of_le l).trans hls) with ⟨x, hxs, hxl⟩
  exact ⟨x, hxs, (ClusterPt.of_le_nhds hxl).mono (Ultrafilter.of_le l)⟩
#align is_complete_iff_ultrafilter isComplete_iff_ultrafilter

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Cauchy/Variantbe9d15758ccfcfd22121683754cb627db44b8ead6ae7e9b467a9f83159744960.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Cauchy/Variantbe9d15758ccfcfd22121683754cb627db44b8ead6ae7e9b467a9f83159744960.lean#L361).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8d844b674942d472920dc2e03d2c80465cc96dfd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
