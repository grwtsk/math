## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4f925162-e359-91a0-0c0d-3cb67c5d36c2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 637–650.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean

    TotallyBounded (range s) := by
  intro a ha
  obtain ⟨n, hn⟩ := cauchySeq_iff.1 hs a ha
  refine ⟨s '' { k | k ≤ n }, (finite_le_nat _).image _, ?_⟩

  intro m

/-- Given a family of points `xs n`, a family of entourages `V n` of the diagonal and a family of
natural numbers `u n`, the intersection over `n` of the `V n`-neighborhood of `xs 1, ..., xs (u n)`.
Designed to be relatively compact when `V n` tends to the diagonal. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Cauchy/Variant4e0b6aa3b4628f1af85130975ad83926bd1b5c14530faed4fc342b990e177189.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Cauchy/Variant4e0b6aa3b4628f1af85130975ad83926bd1b5c14530faed4fc342b990e177189.lean#L637).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `662eabc97c2bdea7893341296de0a9465bc6d2c6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
