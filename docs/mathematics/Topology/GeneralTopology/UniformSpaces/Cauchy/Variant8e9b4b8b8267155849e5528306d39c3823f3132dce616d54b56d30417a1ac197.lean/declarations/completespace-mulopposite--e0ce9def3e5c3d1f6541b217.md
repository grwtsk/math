## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9d10b9b60c5679616a3d980ce8376edd8fcfa1c76835d21f92065025524a7648`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 404–410.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance CompleteSpace.mulOpposite [CompleteSpace α] : CompleteSpace αᵐᵒᵖ where
  complete hf :=
    MulOpposite.op_surjective.exists.mpr <|
      let ⟨x, hx⟩ := CompleteSpace.complete (hf.map MulOpposite.uniformContinuous_unop)
      ⟨x, (map_le_iff_le_comap.mp hx).trans_eq <| MulOpposite.comap_unop_nhds _⟩

/-- If `univ` is complete, the space is a complete space -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Cauchy/Variant8e9b4b8b8267155849e5528306d39c3823f3132dce616d54b56d30417a1ac197.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Cauchy/Variant8e9b4b8b8267155849e5528306d39c3823f3132dce616d54b56d30417a1ac197.lean#L404).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `768044dc607acfa19eb9c8e0182095611b50e530` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
