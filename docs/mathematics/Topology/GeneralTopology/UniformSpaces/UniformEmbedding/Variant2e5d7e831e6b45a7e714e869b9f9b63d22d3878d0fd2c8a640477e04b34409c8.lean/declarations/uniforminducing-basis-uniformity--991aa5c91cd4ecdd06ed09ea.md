## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:763cf6ef-bcb6-adf5-b877-36d8a0fb7f4d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem UniformInducing.basis_uniformity {f : α → β} (hf : UniformInducing f) {ι : Sort*}
    {p : ι → Prop} {s : ι → Set (β × β)} (H : (𝓤 β).HasBasis p s) :
    (𝓤 α).HasBasis p fun i => Prod.map f f ⁻¹' s i :=
  hf.1 ▸ H.comap _
#align uniform_inducing.basis_uniformity UniformInducing.basis_uniformity

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformEmbedding/Variant2e5d7e831e6b45a7e714e869b9f9b63d22d3878d0fd2c8a640477e04b34409c8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformEmbedding/Variant2e5d7e831e6b45a7e714e869b9f9b63d22d3878d0fd2c8a640477e04b34409c8.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5173ca961be529ab41ac00a752f31b33d76b27eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
