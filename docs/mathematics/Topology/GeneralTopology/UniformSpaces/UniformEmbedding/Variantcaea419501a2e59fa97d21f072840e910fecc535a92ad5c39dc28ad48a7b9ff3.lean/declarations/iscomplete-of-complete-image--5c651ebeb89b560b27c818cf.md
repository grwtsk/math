## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:610c8c2d-f969-6cbe-ef32-023773f7081b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 280–289.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isComplete_of_complete_image {m : α → β} {s : Set α} (hm : UniformInducing m)
    (hs : IsComplete (m '' s)) : IsComplete s := by
  intro f hf hfs
  rw [le_principal_iff] at hfs
  obtain ⟨_, ⟨x, hx, rfl⟩, hyf⟩ : ∃ y ∈ m '' s, map m f ≤ 𝓝 y
  exact hs (f.map m) (hf.map hm.uniformContinuous) (le_principal_iff.2 (image_mem_map hfs))
  rw [map_le_iff_le_comap, ← nhds_induced, ← hm.inducing.induced] at hyf
  exact ⟨x, hx, hyf⟩
#align is_complete_of_complete_image isComplete_of_complete_image

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformEmbedding/Variantcaea419501a2e59fa97d21f072840e910fecc535a92ad5c39dc28ad48a7b9ff3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformEmbedding/Variantcaea419501a2e59fa97d21f072840e910fecc535a92ad5c39dc28ad48a7b9ff3.lean#L280).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `07cce3462a92c1f6d444f9cb117ead8f1101703b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
