## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:224a7078-5589-974e-ea7f-de4bb2f4a43c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 214–225.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem comap_uniformity_of_spaced_out {α} {f : α → β} {s : Set (β × β)} (hs : s ∈ 𝓤 β)
    (hf : Pairwise fun x y => (f x, f y) ∉ s) : comap (Prod.map f f) (𝓤 β) = 𝓟 idRel := by
  refine' le_antisymm _ (@refl_le_uniformity α (UniformSpace.comap f _))
  calc
    comap (Prod.map f f) (𝓤 β) ≤ comap (Prod.map f f) (𝓟 s) := comap_mono (le_principal_iff.2 hs)
    _ = 𝓟 (Prod.map f f ⁻¹' s) := comap_principal
    _ ≤ 𝓟 idRel := principal_mono.2 ?_
  rintro ⟨x, y⟩; simpa [not_imp_not] using @hf x y
#align comap_uniformity_of_spaced_out comap_uniformity_of_spaced_out

/-- If a map `f : α → β` sends any two distinct points to point that are **not** related by a fixed
`s ∈ 𝓤 β`, then `f` is a uniform embedding with respect to the discrete uniformity on `α`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformEmbedding/Variantcaea419501a2e59fa97d21f072840e910fecc535a92ad5c39dc28ad48a7b9ff3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformEmbedding/Variantcaea419501a2e59fa97d21f072840e910fecc535a92ad5c39dc28ad48a7b9ff3.lean#L214).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `07cce3462a92c1f6d444f9cb117ead8f1101703b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
