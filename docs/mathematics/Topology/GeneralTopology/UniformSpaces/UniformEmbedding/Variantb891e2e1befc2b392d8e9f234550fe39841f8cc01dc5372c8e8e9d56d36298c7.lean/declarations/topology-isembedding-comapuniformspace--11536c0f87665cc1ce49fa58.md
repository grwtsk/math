## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:030acc53238d4bf303efd81d9da52c3abbb0b896577db97d46d690e09c73efe3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 431–437.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Topology.IsEmbedding.comapUniformSpace {α β} [TopologicalSpace α] [u : UniformSpace β]
    (f : α → β) (h : IsEmbedding f) : UniformSpace α :=
  (u.comap f).replaceTopology h.eq_induced

@[deprecated (since := "2024-10-26")]
alias Embedding.comapUniformSpace := IsEmbedding.comapUniformSpace

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformEmbedding/Variantb891e2e1befc2b392d8e9f234550fe39841f8cc01dc5372c8e8e9d56d36298c7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformEmbedding/Variantb891e2e1befc2b392d8e9f234550fe39841f8cc01dc5372c8e8e9d56d36298c7.lean#L431).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `525c5aab94ef608eafc2c73d11eb2e92229a3d71` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
