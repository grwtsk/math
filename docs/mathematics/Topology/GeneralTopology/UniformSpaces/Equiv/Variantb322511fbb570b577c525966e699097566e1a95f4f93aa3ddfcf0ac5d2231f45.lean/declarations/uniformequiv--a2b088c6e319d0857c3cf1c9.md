## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2c341dafbff739c585eed219b5fe6f1ec4c9300865ba01dd71fb76bbb9fa56be`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 33–46.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure UniformEquiv (α : Type*) (β : Type*) [UniformSpace α] [UniformSpace β] extends
  α ≃ β where
  /-- Uniform continuity of the function -/
  uniformContinuous_toFun : UniformContinuous toFun
  /-- Uniform continuity of the inverse -/
  uniformContinuous_invFun : UniformContinuous invFun

/-- Uniform isomorphism between `α` and `β` -/
infixl:25 " ≃ᵤ " => UniformEquiv

namespace UniformEquiv

variable [UniformSpace α] [UniformSpace β] [UniformSpace γ] [UniformSpace δ]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Equiv/Variantb322511fbb570b577c525966e699097566e1a95f4f93aa3ddfcf0ac5d2231f45.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Equiv/Variantb322511fbb570b577c525966e699097566e1a95f4f93aa3ddfcf0ac5d2231f45.lean#L33).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aa00a4348e38226e8de92bb99dcc869baeca8254` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
