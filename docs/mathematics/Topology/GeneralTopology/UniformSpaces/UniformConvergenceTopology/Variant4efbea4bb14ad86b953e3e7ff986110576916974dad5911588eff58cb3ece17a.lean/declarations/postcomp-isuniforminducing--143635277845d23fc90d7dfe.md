## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9153e695-f06e-1c61-84fc-41e32e95aa3e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 872–887.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma postcomp_isUniformInducing [UniformSpace γ] {f : γ → β}
    (hf : IsUniformInducing f) : IsUniformInducing (ofFun 𝔖 ∘ (f ∘ ·) ∘ toFun 𝔖) := by
  -- This is a direct consequence of `UniformOnFun.comap_eq`
  constructor
  replace hf : (𝓤 β).comap (Prod.map f f) = _ := hf.comap_uniformity
  change comap (Prod.map (ofFun 𝔖 ∘ (f ∘ ·) ∘ toFun 𝔖) (ofFun 𝔖 ∘ (f ∘ ·) ∘ toFun 𝔖)) _ = _
  rw [← uniformity_comap] at hf ⊢
  congr
  rw [← UniformSpace.ext hf, UniformOnFun.comap_eq]
  rfl

/-- Post-composition by a uniform embedding is a uniform embedding for the
uniform structures of `𝔖`-convergence.

More precisely, if `f : γ → β` is a uniform embedding, then
`(fun g ↦ f ∘ g) : (α →ᵤ[𝔖] γ) → (α →ᵤ[𝔖] β)` is a uniform embedding. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergenceTopology/Variant4efbea4bb14ad86b953e3e7ff986110576916974dad5911588eff58cb3ece17a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/UniformConvergenceTopology/Variant4efbea4bb14ad86b953e3e7ff986110576916974dad5911588eff58cb3ece17a.lean#L872).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e8dc1a1f0e8c15131ff125434bf6a82008620bc5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
