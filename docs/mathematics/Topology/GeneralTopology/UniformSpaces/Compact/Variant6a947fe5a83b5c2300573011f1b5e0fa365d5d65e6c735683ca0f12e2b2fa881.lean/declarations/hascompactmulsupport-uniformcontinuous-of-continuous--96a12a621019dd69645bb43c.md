## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:387210fc-b34a-408c-788c-3de217ea4113`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 245–252.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem HasCompactMulSupport.uniformContinuous_of_continuous {f : α → β} [One β]
    (h1 : HasCompactMulSupport f) (h2 : Continuous f) : UniformContinuous f :=
  h2.uniformContinuous_of_tendsto_cocompact h1.is_one_at_infty
#align has_compact_mul_support.uniform_continuous_of_continuous HasCompactMulSupport.uniformContinuous_of_continuous
#align has_compact_support.uniform_continuous_of_continuous HasCompactSupport.uniformContinuous_of_continuous

/-- A family of functions `α → β → γ` tends uniformly to its value at `x` if `α` is locally compact,
`β` is compact and `f` is continuous on `U × (univ : Set β)` for some neighborhood `U` of `x`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Compact/Variant6a947fe5a83b5c2300573011f1b5e0fa365d5d65e6c735683ca0f12e2b2fa881.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformSpaces/Compact/Variant6a947fe5a83b5c2300573011f1b5e0fa365d5d65e6c735683ca0f12e2b2fa881.lean#L245).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `97ab3169a8e315499a405b1973150ada5e21b9bb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
