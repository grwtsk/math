## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:691fd1d8-509f-c22b-efe1-c7845f98f078`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 475–492.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem other_ne {a : α} {z : Sym2 α} (hd : ¬IsDiag z) (h : a ∈ z) : Mem.other h ≠ a := by
  contrapose! hd
  have h' := Sym2.other_spec h
  rw [hd] at h'
  rw [← h']
  simp
#align sym2.other_ne Sym2.other_ne

section Relations

/-! ### Declarations about symmetric relations -/


variable {r : α → α → Prop}

/-- Symmetric relations define a set on `Sym2 α` by taking all those pairs
of elements that are related.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Sym2/Variant68f636343def07ab831b883d5c072268c6cc24bbad52038d144d41198a60ae72.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Sym2/Variant68f636343def07ab831b883d5c072268c6cc24bbad52038d144d41198a60ae72.lean#L475).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bb056b3eb4d9a749861b530e0d72e687c027cec9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
