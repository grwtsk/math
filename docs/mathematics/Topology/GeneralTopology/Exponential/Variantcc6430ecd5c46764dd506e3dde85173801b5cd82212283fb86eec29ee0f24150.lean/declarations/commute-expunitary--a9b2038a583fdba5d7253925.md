## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9e2d88cf-cec9-0540-5dfc-87e1636115bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 65–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Commute.expUnitary {a b : selfAdjoint A} (h : Commute (a : A) (b : A)) :
    Commute (expUnitary a) (expUnitary b) :=
  calc
    selfAdjoint.expUnitary a * selfAdjoint.expUnitary b =
        selfAdjoint.expUnitary b * selfAdjoint.expUnitary a := by
      rw [← h.expUnitary_add, ← h.symm.expUnitary_add, add_comm]

end Star
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Exponential/Variantcc6430ecd5c46764dd506e3dde85173801b5cd82212283fb86eec29ee0f24150.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Exponential/Variantcc6430ecd5c46764dd506e3dde85173801b5cd82212283fb86eec29ee0f24150.lean#L65).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5a2b6aaf59f996bb39b79e8464165fbb4fa2b2ee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
