## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7ec625f4-042f-c8bd-ecc1-cf8d4cdbc82c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 369–381.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem tendsto_Lp_of_tendstoInMeasure (hp : 1 ≤ p) (hp' : p ≠ ∞)
    (hf : ∀ n, AEStronglyMeasurable (f n) μ) (hg : MemLp g p μ)
    (hui : UnifIntegrable f p μ) (hut : UnifTight f p μ)
    (hfg : TendstoInMeasure μ f atTop g) :
    Tendsto (fun n ↦ eLpNorm (f n - g) p μ) atTop (𝓝 0) := by
  refine tendsto_of_subseq_tendsto fun ns hns ↦ ?_
  obtain ⟨ms, _, hms'⟩ := TendstoInMeasure.exists_seq_tendsto_ae fun ε hε ↦ (hfg ε hε).comp hns
  exact ⟨ms, tendsto_Lp_of_tendsto_ae hp hp' (fun _ ↦ hf _) hg (hui.comp _) (hut.comp _) hms'⟩

/-- **Vitali's convergence theorem** (non-finite measure version).

A sequence of functions `f` converges to `g` in Lp
if and only if it is uniformly integrable, uniformly tight and converges to `g` in measure. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UnifTight/Variant7c15e1d2bcee9e73d09fd8cc2b80d90d7cb3fa2dd4024d5f3633edb8ce95fb75.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UnifTight/Variant7c15e1d2bcee9e73d09fd8cc2b80d90d7cb3fa2dd4024d5f3633edb8ce95fb75.lean#L369).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b2b8d4d9c70d3649aafa7ebb734ed77fb346644a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
