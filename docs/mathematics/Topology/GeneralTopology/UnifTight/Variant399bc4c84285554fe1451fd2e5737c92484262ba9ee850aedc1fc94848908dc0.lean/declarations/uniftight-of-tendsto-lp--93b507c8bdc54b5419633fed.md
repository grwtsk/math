## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f412d82b-32c5-b26b-c561-b57bf8e6d429`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 230–244.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem unifTight_of_tendsto_Lp (hp' : p ≠ ∞) (hf : ∀ n, MemLp (f n) p μ)
    (hg : MemLp g p μ) (hfg : Tendsto (fun n => eLpNorm (f n - g) p μ) atTop (𝓝 0)) :
    UnifTight f p μ := by
  have : f = (fun _ => g) + fun n => f n - g := by ext1 n; simp
  rw [this]
  refine UnifTight.add ?_ ?_ (fun _ => hg.aestronglyMeasurable)
      fun n => (hf n).1.sub hg.aestronglyMeasurable
  · exact unifTight_const hp' hg
  · exact unifTight_of_tendsto_Lp_zero hp' (fun n => (hf n).sub hg) hfg

/- Next we deal with the forward direction. The `MemLp` and `TendstoInMeasure` hypotheses
are unwrapped and strengthened (by known lemmas) to also have the `StronglyMeasurable`
and a.e. convergence hypotheses. The bulk of the proof is done under these stronger hypotheses. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UnifTight/Variant399bc4c84285554fe1451fd2e5737c92484262ba9ee850aedc1fc94848908dc0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UnifTight/Variant399bc4c84285554fe1451fd2e5737c92484262ba9ee850aedc1fc94848908dc0.lean#L230).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6e891a5aed639042759ae1e0754704392cd00f26` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
