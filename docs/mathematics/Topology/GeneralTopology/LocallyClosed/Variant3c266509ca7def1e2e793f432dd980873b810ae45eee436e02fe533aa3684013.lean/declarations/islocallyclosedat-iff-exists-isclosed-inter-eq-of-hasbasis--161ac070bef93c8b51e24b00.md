## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ca3a25f0-0638-046f-f705-fd1fc7663f6f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 222–229.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isLocallyClosedAt_iff_exists_isClosed_inter_eq_of_hasBasis {ι : Type*} {p : ι → Prop}
    {U : ι → Set X} {x : X} (H : (𝓝 x).HasBasis p U) : IsLocallyClosedAt s x ↔
    ∃ i, p i ∧ ∃ Z, IsClosed Z ∧ U i ∩ s = U i ∩ Z := by
  have (U V : Set X) (U_sub_V : U ⊆ V) (h : ∃ Z, IsClosed Z ∧ V ∩ s = V ∩ Z) :
      ∃ Z, IsClosed Z ∧ U ∩ s = U ∩ Z :=
    h.imp fun Z hZ ↦ hZ.imp_right fun eq ↦ inter_eq_inter_mono_left eq U_sub_V
  rw [IsLocallyClosedAt, H.exists_iff this]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyClosed/Variant3c266509ca7def1e2e793f432dd980873b810ae45eee436e02fe533aa3684013.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyClosed/Variant3c266509ca7def1e2e793f432dd980873b810ae45eee436e02fe533aa3684013.lean#L222).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6d4b7e2f8a1979ca213f76cbedfa4cd8407ba991` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
