## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8e65a1c2-7433-a311-fc5e-0d39a4645c19`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 207–219.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem le_of_mem_compression_of_notMem (h : a ∈ 𝓒 u v s) (ha : a ∉ s) : u ≤ a := by
  rw [mem_compression] at h
  obtain h | ⟨-, b, hb, hba⟩ := h
  · cases ha h.1
  unfold compress at hba
  split_ifs at hba with h
  · rw [← hba, le_sdiff]
    exact ⟨le_sup_right, h.1.mono_right h.2⟩
  · cases ne_of_mem_of_not_mem hb ha hba

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UV/Variant77d0303125503470003c01803d2bded6b10054cfd3b366f9666a019a757b1ba6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UV/Variant77d0303125503470003c01803d2bded6b10054cfd3b366f9666a019a757b1ba6.lean#L207).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fee705f8ab0733c9c7ad58cbdbfcb1f55b3f392c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
