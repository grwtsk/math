## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7d074c3d-b45e-07d6-ab95-9205c30792f2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 194–201.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem compression_idem (u v : α) (s : Finset α) : 𝓒 u v (𝓒 u v s) = 𝓒 u v s := by
  have h : {a ∈ 𝓒 u v s | compress u v a ∉ 𝓒 u v s} = ∅ :=
    filter_false_of_mem fun a ha h ↦ h <| compress_mem_compression_of_mem_compression ha
  rw [compression, filter_image, h, image_empty, ← h]
  exact filter_union_filter_neg_eq _ (compression u v s)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UV/Variant77d0303125503470003c01803d2bded6b10054cfd3b366f9666a019a757b1ba6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UV/Variant77d0303125503470003c01803d2bded6b10054cfd3b366f9666a019a757b1ba6.lean#L194).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fee705f8ab0733c9c7ad58cbdbfcb1f55b3f392c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
