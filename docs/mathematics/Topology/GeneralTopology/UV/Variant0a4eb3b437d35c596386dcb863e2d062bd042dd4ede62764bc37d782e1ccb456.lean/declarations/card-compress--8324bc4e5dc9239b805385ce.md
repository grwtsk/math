## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4fe355f5-fbfe-d118-eeb7-feab54b152c2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 276–282.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  unfold compress

  · rw [card_sdiff_of_subset (h.2.trans le_sup_left), sup_eq_union,
      card_union_of_disjoint h.1.symm, huv, add_tsub_cancel_right]
  · rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UV/Variant0a4eb3b437d35c596386dcb863e2d062bd042dd4ede62764bc37d782e1ccb456.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UV/Variant0a4eb3b437d35c596386dcb863e2d062bd042dd4ede62764bc37d782e1ccb456.lean#L276).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c3b3f942832c5af0b482a4d586d0c636758285ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
