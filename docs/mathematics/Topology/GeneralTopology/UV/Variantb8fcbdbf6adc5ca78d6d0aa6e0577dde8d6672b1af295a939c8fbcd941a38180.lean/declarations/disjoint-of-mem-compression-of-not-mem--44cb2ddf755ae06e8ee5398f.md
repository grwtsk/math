## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bf761afa-9527-5806-3b1f-dc8a3e80053c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 240–250.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem disjoint_of_mem_compression_of_not_mem (h : a ∈ 𝓒 u v s) (ha : a ∉ s) : Disjoint v a := by
  rw [mem_compression] at h
  obtain h | ⟨-, b, hb, hba⟩ := h
  · cases ha h.1
  unfold compress at hba
  split_ifs at hba
  · rw [← hba]
    exact disjoint_sdiff_self_right
  · cases ne_of_mem_of_not_mem hb ha hba
#align uv.disjoint_of_mem_compression_of_not_mem UV.disjoint_of_mem_compression_of_not_mem

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UV/Variantb8fcbdbf6adc5ca78d6d0aa6e0577dde8d6672b1af295a939c8fbcd941a38180.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UV/Variantb8fcbdbf6adc5ca78d6d0aa6e0577dde8d6672b1af295a939c8fbcd941a38180.lean#L240).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bbe3ddf1b0aa54ab030f9c9e22e1187d93de6af2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
