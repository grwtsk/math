## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:996d4621-df15-34c8-f722-caae270b162a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 61–75.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    [IsDirectedOrder α] [(atTop : Filter α).IsCountablyGenerated] :

  obtain ⟨ys, h⟩ := exists_seq_tendsto (atTop : Filter α)
  choose c hleft hright using exists_ge_ge (α := α)
  set xs : ℕ → α := fun n => (List.range n).foldl (fun x n ↦ c x (ys n)) (ys 0)
  have hsucc (n : ℕ) : xs (n + 1) = c (xs n) (ys n) := by simp [xs, List.range_succ]
  refine ⟨xs, ?_, ?_⟩

    apply hleft
  · refine (tendsto_add_atTop_iff_nat 1).1 <| tendsto_atTop_mono (fun n ↦ ?_) h
    rw [hsucc]
    apply hright

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CountablyGenerated/Variant3c1d68629ce12667363796008d575e8289344ffface525bafae8e9db5e57b909.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CountablyGenerated/Variant3c1d68629ce12667363796008d575e8289344ffface525bafae8e9db5e57b909.lean#L61).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2152dd3acd2e58ace686df75b92ef29e9370de06` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
