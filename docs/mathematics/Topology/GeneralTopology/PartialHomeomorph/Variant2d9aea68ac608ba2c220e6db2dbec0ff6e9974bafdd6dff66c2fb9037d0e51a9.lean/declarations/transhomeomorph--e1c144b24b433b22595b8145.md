## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:003ab2dc0fb5e63aea68f3f604ac67c87c35f99aec1d1ddafc118624ce140e71`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1267–1273.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def transHomeomorph (e : PartialHomeomorph X Y) (f' : Y ≃ₜ Z) : PartialHomeomorph X Z where
  toPartialEquiv := e.toPartialEquiv.transEquiv f'.toEquiv
  open_source := e.open_source
  open_target := e.open_target.preimage f'.symm.continuous
  continuousOn_toFun := f'.continuous.comp_continuousOn e.continuousOn
  continuousOn_invFun := e.symm.continuousOn.comp f'.symm.continuous.continuousOn fun _ => id

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/PartialHomeomorph/Variant2d9aea68ac608ba2c220e6db2dbec0ff6e9974bafdd6dff66c2fb9037d0e51a9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PartialHomeomorph/Variant2d9aea68ac608ba2c220e6db2dbec0ff6e9974bafdd6dff66c2fb9037d0e51a9.lean#L1267).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cd07fefc073617e1b552badfad718ee1d041de7f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
