## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ce00277bd3ec95a7b6a1fffa9df41b75c3193306c875c387bd63d0273920801f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 268–294.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def piEquivL :
    (Π i, E →L[𝕜] F i) ≃L[𝕜] (E →L[𝕜] Π i, F i) where
  toFun F := ContinuousLinearMap.pi F
  invFun f i := (ContinuousLinearMap.proj i).comp f
  __ := UniformConvergenceCLM.piEquivL _ _ _

end Pi

section BilinearMaps
variable {R 𝕜 𝕜₂ 𝕜₃ : Type*}
variable {E F G : Type*}

/-!
We prove some computation rules for continuous (semi-)bilinear maps in their first argument.
If `f` is a continuous bilinear map, to use the corresponding rules for the second argument, use
`(f _).map_add` and similar.

section AddCommMonoid
variable
  [Semiring R] [NormedField 𝕜₂] [NormedField 𝕜₃]
  [AddCommMonoid E] [Module R E] [TopologicalSpace E]
  [AddCommGroup F] [Module 𝕜₂ F] [TopologicalSpace F]
  [AddCommGroup G] [Module 𝕜₃ G]
  [TopologicalSpace G] [IsTopologicalAddGroup G] [ContinuousConstSMul 𝕜₃ G]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ContinuousLinearMap/Variant9ef1c945e63bf269f3f706e10ea3c4efd07ab47a6d13be6a873e97183668952e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ContinuousLinearMap/Variant9ef1c945e63bf269f3f706e10ea3c4efd07ab47a6d13be6a873e97183668952e.lean#L268).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `105cf6b50e641ed8e6379cc3d9cc9459694813c2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
