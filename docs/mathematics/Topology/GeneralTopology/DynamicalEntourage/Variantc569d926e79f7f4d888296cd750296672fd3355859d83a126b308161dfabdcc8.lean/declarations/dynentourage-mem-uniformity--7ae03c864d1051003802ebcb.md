## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:07fcdd09-5f89-f516-18d3-c524747f2986`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 71–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma dynEntourage_mem_uniformity [UniformSpace X] {T : X → X} (h : UniformContinuous T)
    {U : Set (X × X)} (U_uni : U ∈ 𝓤 X) (n : ℕ) :
    dynEntourage T U n ∈ 𝓤 X := by
  rw [dynEntourage_eq_inter_Ico T U n]
  refine Filter.iInter_mem.2 fun k ↦ ?_
  rw [map_iterate T T k]
  exact uniformContinuous_def.1 (UniformContinuous.iterate T k h) U U_uni

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/DynamicalEntourage/Variantc569d926e79f7f4d888296cd750296672fd3355859d83a126b308161dfabdcc8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/DynamicalEntourage/Variantc569d926e79f7f4d888296cd750296672fd3355859d83a126b308161dfabdcc8.lean#L71).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `20ea9df4a15893e3631ee6ed827a6f9a7294ea4f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
