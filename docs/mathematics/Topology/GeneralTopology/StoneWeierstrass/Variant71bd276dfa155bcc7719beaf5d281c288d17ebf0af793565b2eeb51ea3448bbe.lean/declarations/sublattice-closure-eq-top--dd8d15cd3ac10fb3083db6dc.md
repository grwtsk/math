## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fc36c454-0ed4-971e-72d8-7f5b47542776`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 165–264.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    The strategy now is to pick a family of continuous functions `g x y` in `A`
    with the property that `g x y x = f x` and `g x y y = f y`
    (this is immediate from `h : SeparatesPointsStrongly`)
    then use continuity to see that `g x y` is close to `f` near both `x` and `y`,
    and finally using compactness to produce the desired function `h`
    as a maximum over finitely many `x` of a minimum over finitely many `y` of the `g x y`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/StoneWeierstrass/Variant71bd276dfa155bcc7719beaf5d281c288d17ebf0af793565b2eeb51ea3448bbe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/StoneWeierstrass/Variant71bd276dfa155bcc7719beaf5d281c288d17ebf0af793565b2eeb51ea3448bbe.lean#L165).
