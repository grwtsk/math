## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cd27cbb7-635a-8aed-d87e-10d7e3d6bbe1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 262–268.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma eq_liftPath_iff {Γ : I → E} : Γ = cov.liftPath γ e γ_0 ↔ Continuous Γ ∧ p ∘ Γ = γ ∧ Γ 0 = e :=
  have lifts := cov.liftPath_lifts γ e γ_0
  have zero := cov.liftPath_zero γ e γ_0
  ⟨(· ▸ ⟨(cov.liftPath γ e γ_0).2, lifts, zero⟩), fun ⟨Γ_cont, Γ_lifts, Γ_0⟩ ↦ cov.eq_of_comp_eq
    Γ_cont (cov.liftPath γ e γ_0).continuous (Γ_lifts ▸ lifts.symm) 0 (Γ_0 ▸ zero.symm)⟩

/-- Unique characterization of the lifted path. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lifting/Variant419cae2e57794c26af0ad51d280421404f70c76c7d34ee4229b79a3b18974d85.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lifting/Variant419cae2e57794c26af0ad51d280421404f70c76c7d34ee4229b79a3b18974d85.lean#L262).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `563550223778da73d8509d3eb6f87cd99da7cae7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
