## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:71da8803-53cf-7ddd-7074-467349182797`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 53–66.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Filter.tendsto_cocompact_cocompact_of_norm [ProperSpace E] {f : E → F}
    (h : ∀ ε : ℝ, ∃ r : ℝ, ∀ x : E, r < ‖x‖ → ε < ‖f x‖) :
    Tendsto f (cocompact E) (cocompact F) := by
  rw [tendsto_def]
  intro s hs
  rcases closedBall_compl_subset_of_mem_cocompact hs 0 with ⟨ε, hε⟩
  rcases h ε with ⟨r, hr⟩
  apply mem_cocompact_of_closedBall_compl_subset 0
  use r
  intro x hx
  simp only [Set.mem_compl_iff, Metric.mem_closedBall, dist_zero_right, not_le] at hx
  apply hε
  simp [hr x hx]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CocompactMap/Variant49823c3b9fb003cd45953439a19dd6771d6dd3949dc22990a190e4be1896a70f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CocompactMap/Variant49823c3b9fb003cd45953439a19dd6771d6dd3949dc22990a190e4be1896a70f.lean#L53).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `88706419894e859014e3ab1ee3d4ea3acd50c614` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
