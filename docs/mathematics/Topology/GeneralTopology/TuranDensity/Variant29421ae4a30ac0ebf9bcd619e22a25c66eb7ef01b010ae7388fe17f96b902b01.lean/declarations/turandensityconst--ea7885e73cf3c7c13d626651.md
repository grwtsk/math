## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:24326ef3e1da98aee8f54af61fb25d7d9959117e968a8be4b380869039a7af31`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 153–159.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable abbrev turanDensityConst (H : SimpleGraph W) (ε : ℝ) :=
  if h : ε > 0 then
    Nat.find <| eventually_atTop.mp <| eventually_isContained_of_card_edgeFinset H h
  else 0

/-- Simple graphs on `card V` vertices having at least `(turanDensity H + o(1)) * (card V) ^ 2`
edges contain `H`, for sufficiently large `card V`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/TuranDensity/Variant29421ae4a30ac0ebf9bcd619e22a25c66eb7ef01b010ae7388fe17f96b902b01.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/TuranDensity/Variant29421ae4a30ac0ebf9bcd619e22a25c66eb7ef01b010ae7388fe17f96b902b01.lean#L153).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0872ba82d0a75b157a410be7c6251980042ec45c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
