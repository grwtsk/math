## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a247ae4e-f5ce-b7a0-bb37-4bc988e390a4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 373–384.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem count_eq_card_filter_eq [DecidableEq α] (s : Multiset α) (a : α) :
    s.count a = card (s.filter (a = ·)) := by rw [count, countP_eq_card_filter]

/--
Mapping a multiset through a predicate and counting the `True`s yields the cardinality of the set
filtered by the predicate. Note that this uses the notion of a multiset of `Prop`s - due to the
decidability requirements of `count`, the decidability instance on the LHS is different from the
RHS. In particular, the decidability instance on the left leaks `Classical.decEq`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Filter/Variant290f1e01c04615ac9a72d5e53c7a3b98e0c27182ea054b318ebb3e1ef16567c5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Filter/Variant290f1e01c04615ac9a72d5e53c7a3b98e0c27182ea054b318ebb3e1ef16567c5.lean#L373).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1321606a8ae06d88c818ca1f4bc286ffcff0c044` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
