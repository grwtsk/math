## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4903d99d-5d7d-6449-c2cf-fb553e24006e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 199–208.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Continuous.discrete_of_tendsto_cofinite_cocompact [T1Space X] [WeaklyLocallyCompactSpace Y]
    (hf' : Continuous f) (hf : Tendsto f cofinite (cocompact _)) :
    DiscreteTopology X := by
  refine discreteTopology_iff_isOpen_singleton.mpr (fun x ↦ ?_)
  obtain ⟨K : Set Y, hK : IsCompact K, hK' : K ∈ 𝓝 (f x)⟩ := exists_compact_mem_nhds (f x)
  obtain ⟨U : Set Y, hU₁ : U ⊆ K, hU₂ : IsOpen U, hU₃ : f x ∈ U⟩ := mem_nhds_iff.mp hK'
  have hU₄ : Set.Finite (f ⁻¹' U) :=
    Finite.subset (tendsto_cofinite_cocompact_iff.mp hf K hK) (preimage_mono hU₁)
  exact isOpen_singleton_of_finite_mem_nhds _ ((hU₂.preimage hf').mem_nhds hU₃) hU₄

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/DiscreteSubset/Variantfe86717480f5db6e31cb5dfbcd58f4d330e897be2f30420b4d3829d5ca472e02.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/DiscreteSubset/Variantfe86717480f5db6e31cb5dfbcd58f4d330e897be2f30420b4d3829d5ca472e02.lean#L199).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c3f3ea1f154904c59164564b00ca3de3977939d3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
