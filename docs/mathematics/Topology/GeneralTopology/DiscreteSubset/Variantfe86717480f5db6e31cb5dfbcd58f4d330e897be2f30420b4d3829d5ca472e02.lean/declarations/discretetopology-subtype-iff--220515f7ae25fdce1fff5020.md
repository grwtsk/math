## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:43454a1e-021b-24ee-c3a2-2d6c0ee03d4c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 72–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma discreteTopology_subtype_iff' {S : Set Y} :
    DiscreteTopology S ↔ ∀ y ∈ S, ∃ U : Set Y, IsOpen U ∧ U ∩ S = {y} := by
  simp [discreteTopology_iff_isOpen_singleton, isOpen_induced_iff, Set.ext_iff]
  grind

/-- A set `s` is discrete iff for every `y ∈ s` there is an open `u` with `u ∩ s = {y}`.
See `isDiscrete_iff_forall_subset_exists_isOpen'` for a related version of this with subsets. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/DiscreteSubset/Variantfe86717480f5db6e31cb5dfbcd58f4d330e897be2f30420b4d3829d5ca472e02.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/DiscreteSubset/Variantfe86717480f5db6e31cb5dfbcd58f4d330e897be2f30420b4d3829d5ca472e02.lean#L72).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c3f3ea1f154904c59164564b00ca3de3977939d3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
