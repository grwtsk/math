## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:baaf2700da6b129e0066c2badc5b7ea80bb4d9167d17c3e60729d09a3a072f41`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 224–236.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def UpperLowerSet_toOrderDualHomeomorph [Preorder α] :
    WithUpperSetTopology α ≃ₜ WithLowerSetTopology αᵒᵈ where
  toFun := OrderDual.toDual
  invFun := OrderDual.ofDual
  left_inv := OrderDual.toDual_ofDual
  right_inv := OrderDual.ofDual_toDual
  continuous_toFun := continuous_coinduced_rng
  continuous_invFun := continuous_coinduced_rng

/--
The upper set topology is the topology where the open sets are the upper sets. In general the upper
set topology does not coincide with the upper topology.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UpperLowerSetTopology/Variant3c93e365188a982eafcad3ddabf50647bd53cd8a102394c69b9c5567b9ce7e84.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UpperLowerSetTopology/Variant3c93e365188a982eafcad3ddabf50647bd53cd8a102394c69b9c5567b9ce7e84.lean#L224).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0d66285de15d86a95e5e7df2792f0a0472c4270c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
