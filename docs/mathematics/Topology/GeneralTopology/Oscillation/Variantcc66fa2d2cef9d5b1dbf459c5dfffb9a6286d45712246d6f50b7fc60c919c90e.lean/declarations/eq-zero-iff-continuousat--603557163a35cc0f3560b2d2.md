## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e285bfdf-21be-7bd1-ffdc-f492cab076ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 91–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_zero_iff_continuousAt [TopologicalSpace E] (f : E → F) (x : E) :
    oscillation f x = 0 ↔ ContinuousAt f x := by
  rw [← oscillationWithin_univ_eq_oscillation, ← continuousWithinAt_univ f x]
  exact OscillationWithin.eq_zero_iff_continuousWithinAt f (mem_univ x)

end Oscillation

namespace IsCompact

variable [PseudoEMetricSpace E] {K : Set E}
variable {f : E → F} {D : Set E} {ε : ENNReal}

/-- If `oscillationWithin f D x < ε` at every `x` in a compact set `K`, then there exists `δ > 0`
such that the oscillation of `f` on `ball x δ ∩ D` is less than `ε` for every `x` in `K`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Oscillation/Variantcc66fa2d2cef9d5b1dbf459c5dfffb9a6286d45712246d6f50b7fc60c919c90e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Oscillation/Variantcc66fa2d2cef9d5b1dbf459c5dfffb9a6286d45712246d6f50b7fc60c919c90e.lean#L91).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7a32aec3b3fa69ef0f35ce3f4af8e590d0cca858` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
