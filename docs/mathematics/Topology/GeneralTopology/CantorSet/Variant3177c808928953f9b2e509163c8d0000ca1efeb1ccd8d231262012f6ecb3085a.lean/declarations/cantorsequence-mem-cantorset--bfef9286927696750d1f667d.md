## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:080a84af-b123-5b3b-4da0-fb2e5958a29a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 235–246.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cantorSequence_mem_cantorSet {x : ℝ} (hx : x ∈ cantorSet) (n : ℕ) :
    (cantorSequence x).get n ∈ cantorSet := by
  induction n with
  | zero => simpa [cantorSequence]
  | succ n ih => exact cantorStep_mem_cantorSet ih

/-- Points of the Cantor set correspond to infinite paths in the full binary tree.
at each level `n`, the set `preCantorSet (n + 1)` splits each interval in
`preCantorSet n` into two parts.
Given `x ∈ cantorSet`, the point `x` lies in one of the intervals of `preCantorSet n`.
This function tracks which of the two intervals in `preCantorSet (n + 1)`
contains `x` at each step, producing the corresponding path as a stream of booleans. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CantorSet/Variant3177c808928953f9b2e509163c8d0000ca1efeb1ccd8d231262012f6ecb3085a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CantorSet/Variant3177c808928953f9b2e509163c8d0000ca1efeb1ccd8d231262012f6ecb3085a.lean#L235).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `79fd5f67185e532e62fc157dbb2ade711ec62428` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
