## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9736adf0-1bb1-ee8a-f0d3-c5fd81348839`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2421–2426.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem get_union_of_not_mem_left [EquivBEq α] [LawfulHashable α]
    {k : α} (not_mem : ¬k ∈ m₁) {h'} :
    Const.get (m₁.union m₂) k h' = Const.get m₂ k (mem_of_mem_union_of_not_mem_left h' not_mem) := by
  revert not_mem h'
  exact m₁.inductionOn₂ m₂ fun _ _ h => DHashMap.Const.get_union_of_not_mem_left h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variantdf850a7a0b9025da985de07781d576dbd091cde9cf0c05a6b6419d9b9888c9cd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variantdf850a7a0b9025da985de07781d576dbd091cde9cf0c05a6b6419d9b9888c9cd.lean#L2421).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1dcdcd09016e074ec7abcabb25fac49b93348b85` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
