## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b2b3e6a5-8d79-08e1-33f3-0b5da3aeefaa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1400–1403.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] theorem getElem_swap_left_of_lt {xs : List α} {i j : Nat} (hj : j < xs.length)
    (hi : i < (xs.swap i j).length) : (xs.swap i j)[i] = xs[j] := by
  rw [getElem_swap_left, dite_eq_left hj]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variant16ec13fe48abbb65912f714937dda5f6ffc776131752897889f6f890cf21b090.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variant16ec13fe48abbb65912f714937dda5f6ffc776131752897889f6f890cf21b090.lean#L1400).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cac2fa5d804016e25f6084d0a442c77d3156de84` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
