## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3e94682d-c563-fad7-b7e8-e8ec74ea7f60`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 537–540.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma IsHomeomorph.pi_map {ι : Type*} {X Y : ι → Type*} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)]
    [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (Y i)] {f : (i : ι) → X i → Y i} (h : ∀ i, IsHomeomorph (f i)) :
    IsHomeomorph (fun (x : ∀ i, X i) i ↦ f i (x i)) :=
  (Homeomorph.piCongrRight fun i ↦ (h i).homeomorph (f i)).isHomeomorph
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variant61c2d4a30c17aebbfd06b1af3133349b14eb9d6c7a9ac085a974a0f897faebb8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variant61c2d4a30c17aebbfd06b1af3133349b14eb9d6c7a9ac085a974a0f897faebb8.lean#L537).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f5f5e3b6bc70616bc7a576fa0e2d2328f85d2da0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
