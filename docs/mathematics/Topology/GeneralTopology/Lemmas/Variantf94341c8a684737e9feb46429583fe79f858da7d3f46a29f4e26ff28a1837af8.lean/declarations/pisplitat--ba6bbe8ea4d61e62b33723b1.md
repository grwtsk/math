## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f9afbfd8acc013bc4034a08dd361463acf195a8dad812f7c15b5bca183ff3484`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 399–415.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def piSplitAt (Y : ι → Type*) [∀ j, TopologicalSpace (Y j)] :
    (∀ j, Y j) ≃ₜ Y i × ∀ j : { j // j ≠ i }, Y j where
  toEquiv := Equiv.piSplitAt i Y
  continuous_toFun := (continuous_apply i).prodMk (continuous_pi fun j => continuous_apply j.1)
  continuous_invFun :=
    continuous_pi fun j => by
      dsimp only [Equiv.piSplitAt]
      split_ifs with h
      · subst h
        exact continuous_fst
      · exact (continuous_apply _).comp continuous_snd

variable (Y)

/-- A product of copies of a topological space can be split as the binary product of one copy and
  the product of all the remaining copies. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variantf94341c8a684737e9feb46429583fe79f858da7d3f46a29f4e26ff28a1837af8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variantf94341c8a684737e9feb46429583fe79f858da7d3f46a29f4e26ff28a1837af8.lean#L399).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8312e3a7de75ec11437146ca69bfed92b08cafe0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
