## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7da83e55-3718-f950-649f-82dc824377d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 499–509.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_countable_dense_no_zero_top :
    ∃ s : Set ℝ≥0∞, s.Countable ∧ Dense s ∧ 0 ∉ s ∧ ∞ ∉ s := by
  obtain ⟨s, s_count, s_dense, hs⟩ :
    ∃ s : Set ℝ≥0∞, s.Countable ∧ Dense s ∧ (∀ x, IsBot x → x ∉ s) ∧ ∀ x, IsTop x → x ∉ s :=
    exists_countable_dense_no_bot_top ℝ≥0∞
  exact ⟨s, s_count, s_dense, fun h => hs.1 0 (by simp) h, fun h => hs.2 ∞ (by simp) h⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Varianta9e6ad952de03520f09626184f0fc11ba7dc1991bf17024c97610071ea231138.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Varianta9e6ad952de03520f09626184f0fc11ba7dc1991bf17024c97610071ea231138.lean#L499).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d557b7f2be78cd090be4a19db377d02bae98d252` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
