## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9d45e9c6-eb51-8a0a-b43e-efa390390853`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1369–1380.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[grind =] theorem filter_pbind {f : (a : α) → o = some a → Option β} :
    (Option.pbind o f).filter p =
      (o.pfilter (fun a h => (f a h).any p)).pbind (fun a h => f a (eq_some_of_pfilter_eq_some h)) := by
  cases o with
  | none => simp
  | some a =>
    simp only [pbind_some, pfilter_some]
    obtain (h|⟨b, h⟩) := Option.eq_none_or_eq_some (f a rfl)
    · simp [h]
    · simp only [h, filter_some, any_some]
      split <;> simp [h]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variant354615be1934455c9d6f3909456afa29459af82fc6b2a7ee74ff91c230e2e18c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variant354615be1934455c9d6f3909456afa29459af82fc6b2a7ee74ff91c230e2e18c.lean#L1369).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `87a93adccf85fda7fa5b1ba0d7721778c5d4e3a8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
