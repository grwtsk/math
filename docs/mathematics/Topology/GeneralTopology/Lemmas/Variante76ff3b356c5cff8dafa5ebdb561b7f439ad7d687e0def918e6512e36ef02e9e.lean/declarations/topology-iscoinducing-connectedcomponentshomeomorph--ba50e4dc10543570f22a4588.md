## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d73ce52bea75738f38bf6cf2db500d7769f025eb2472679db6e73c626e0ce76f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 573–583.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def Topology.IsCoinducing.connectedComponentsHomeomorph {f : X → Y}
    (hf : IsCoinducing f) (hf' : ∀ y, IsConnected (f ⁻¹' {y})) :
    ConnectedComponents X ≃ₜ ConnectedComponents Y :=
  IsHomeomorph.homeomorph hf.continuous.connectedComponentsMap <| by
    have hbij := hf.connectedComponentsMap_bijective hf'
    exact ⟨hf.continuous.connectedComponentsMap_continuous,
      hf.connectedComponentsMap.isOpenMap_of_injective hbij.injective, hbij⟩

variable {f : X → Y} (hf : Topology.IsCoinducing f) (hf' : ∀ y, IsConnected (f ⁻¹' {y}))

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variante76ff3b356c5cff8dafa5ebdb561b7f439ad7d687e0def918e6512e36ef02e9e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variante76ff3b356c5cff8dafa5ebdb561b7f439ad7d687e0def918e6512e36ef02e9e.lean#L573).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6baab7e4c182041ffe730e81632aaec349057894` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
