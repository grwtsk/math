## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8963c020-6f46-2e32-677b-781cb48f8759`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 772–777.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tsum_iUnion_le_tsum {ι : Type*} (f : α → ℝ≥0∞) (t : ι → Set α) :
    ∑' x : ⋃ i, t i, f x ≤ ∑' i, ∑' x : t i, f x :=
  calc ∑' x : ⋃ i, t i, f x ≤ ∑' x : Σ i, t i, f x.2 :=
    tsum_le_tsum_comp_of_surjective (sigmaToiUnion_surjective t) _
  _ = ∑' i, ∑' x : t i, f x := ENNReal.tsum_sigma' _

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variant90de27f739aa7efc0827bea727328e2474a187023d496c197399d0e1de0fe0f7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variant90de27f739aa7efc0827bea727328e2474a187023d496c197399d0e1de0fe0f7.lean#L772).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2b6ad1b40d452d54d1359a5cff20c3984b9d1240` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
