## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ecff28ca-4d6c-a6af-d00e-1876ce894df8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2814–2819.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem prod_eq_foldl [One α] [Mul α] [Std.Associative (α := α) (· * ·)]
    [Std.LawfulIdentity (· * ·) (1 : α)] {xs : List α} :
    xs.prod = xs.foldl (init := 1) (· * ·) := by
  simp [prod_eq_foldr, foldl_eq_apply_foldr, Std.LawfulLeftIdentity.left_id]

-- The argument `f : α₁ → α₂` is intentionally explicit, as it is sometimes not found by unification.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variant3f8a3014898f7d696d2a40baa09e68a44f1d2bf0da4aa0af10c0922b1bf0ab27.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variant3f8a3014898f7d696d2a40baa09e68a44f1d2bf0da4aa0af10c0922b1bf0ab27.lean#L2814).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `320cb9b319d549895b9ccbc5cc2f5256e84577ac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
