## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e8ae82f9-e45e-6332-8663-815bd0415b4a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 32–37.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma squeeze_zero' {α} {f g : α → ℝ} {t₀ : Filter α} (hf : ∀ᶠ t in t₀, 0 ≤ f t)
    (hft : ∀ᶠ t in t₀, f t ≤ g t) (g0 : Tendsto g t₀ (𝓝 0)) : Tendsto f t₀ (𝓝 0) :=
  tendsto_of_tendsto_of_tendsto_of_le_of_le' tendsto_const_nhds g0 hf hft

/-- Special case of the sandwich lemma; see `tendsto_of_tendsto_of_tendsto_of_le_of_le`
and `tendsto_of_tendsto_of_tendsto_of_le_of_le'` for the general case. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variant6a0cf742b00efa9cbd7f386a61c33a84710797bc1fb1cb82d8d92e1951b4df6a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variant6a0cf742b00efa9cbd7f386a61c33a84710797bc1fb1cb82d8d92e1951b4df6a.lean#L32).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f43009fa8c4bfcb46f82727fece38bf05b7b65d7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
