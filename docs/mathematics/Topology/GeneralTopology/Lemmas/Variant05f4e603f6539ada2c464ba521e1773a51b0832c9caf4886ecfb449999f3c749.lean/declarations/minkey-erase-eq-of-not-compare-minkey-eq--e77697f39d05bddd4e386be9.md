## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:62e9709d-d09c-4b36-b626-93bb7c123b65`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 3071–3075.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem minKey!_erase_eq_of_not_compare_minKey!_eq [TransCmp cmp] [Inhabited α] {k}
    (he : t.erase k ≠ ∅) (heq : ¬ cmp k t.minKey! = .eq) :
    (t.erase k).minKey! = t.minKey! :=
  ExtDTreeMap.minKey!_erase_eq_of_not_compare_minKey!_eq (mt ext he) heq

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variant05f4e603f6539ada2c464ba521e1773a51b0832c9caf4886ecfb449999f3c749.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Lemmas/Variant05f4e603f6539ada2c464ba521e1773a51b0832c9caf4886ecfb449999f3c749.lean#L3071).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `386b17bd8e4dea5253f1a7d5b0a83eca130926a0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
