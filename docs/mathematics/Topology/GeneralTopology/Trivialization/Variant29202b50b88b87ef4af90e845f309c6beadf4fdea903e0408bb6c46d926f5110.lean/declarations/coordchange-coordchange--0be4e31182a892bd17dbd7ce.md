## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3981df19-d6c6-79bb-e6c7-6ff02198deb3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 629–634.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coordChange_coordChange (e₁ e₂ e₃ : Trivialization F proj) {b : B} (h₁ : b ∈ e₁.baseSet)
    (h₂ : b ∈ e₂.baseSet) (x : F) :
    e₂.coordChange e₃ b (e₁.coordChange e₂ b x) = e₁.coordChange e₃ b x := by
  rw [coordChange, e₁.mk_coordChange _ h₁ h₂, ← e₂.coe_coe, e₂.left_inv, coordChange]
  rwa [e₂.mem_source, e₁.proj_symm_apply' h₁]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Trivialization/Variant29202b50b88b87ef4af90e845f309c6beadf4fdea903e0408bb6c46d926f5110.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Trivialization/Variant29202b50b88b87ef4af90e845f309c6beadf4fdea903e0408bb6c46d926f5110.lean#L629).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `78eeb100467d6ff99ce8ccbfcaa26c54e8da9748` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
