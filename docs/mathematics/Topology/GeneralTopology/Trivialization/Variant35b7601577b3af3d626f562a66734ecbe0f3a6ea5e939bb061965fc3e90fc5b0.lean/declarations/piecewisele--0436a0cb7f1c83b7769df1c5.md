## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e457ccff87a75283c28c915f78a0af19a81dfc9f856acc7e01e88ccf4a9b7254`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 816–827.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def piecewiseLe [LinearOrder B] [OrderTopology B] (e e' : Trivialization F proj)
    (a : B) (He : a ∈ e.baseSet) (He' : a ∈ e'.baseSet) : Trivialization F proj :=
  e.piecewiseLeOfEq (e'.transFiberHomeomorph (e'.coordChangeHomeomorph e He' He)) a He He' <| by

    · simp [e.coe_fst', e'.coe_fst', *]
    · simp [coordChange_apply_snd, *]
#align trivialization.piecewise_le Trivialization.piecewiseLe

/-- Given two bundle trivializations `e`, `e'` over disjoint sets, `e.disjoint_union e' H` is the
bundle trivialization over the union of the base sets that agrees with `e` and `e'` over their
base sets. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Trivialization/Variant35b7601577b3af3d626f562a66734ecbe0f3a6ea5e939bb061965fc3e90fc5b0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Trivialization/Variant35b7601577b3af3d626f562a66734ecbe0f3a6ea5e939bb061965fc3e90fc5b0.lean#L816).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ad56c4d3fa8bca7a5bfdedaa6bb14ec96e1fd5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
