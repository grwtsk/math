## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dc40fa82-de96-f149-dc81-8b399420270b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 141–275.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  /- We have to show that `y` can be written as `f x` for some `x ∈ closedBall b ε`.
    The idea of the proof is to apply the Banach contraction principle to the map
    `g : x ↦ x + f'symm (y - f x)`, as a fixed point of this map satisfies `f x = y`.
    When `f'symm` is a genuine linear inverse, `g` is a contracting map. In our case, since `f'symm`
    is nonlinear, this map is not contracting (it is not even continuous), but still the proof of
    the contraction theorem holds: `uₙ = gⁿ b` is a Cauchy sequence, converging exponentially fast
    to the desired point `x`. Instead of appealing to general results, we check this by hand.

    The main point is that `f (u n)` becomes exponentially close to `y`, and therefore
    `dist (u (n+1)) (u n)` becomes exponentally small, making it possible to get an inductive
    bound on `dist (u n) b`, from which one checks that `u n` stays in the ball on which one has a
    control. Therefore, the bound can be checked at the next step, and so on inductively.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ApproximatesLinearOn/Variantf6d05b10806dd1d3a7130c564a80b3546d468b9ff5e983e34aceb394dd5418ea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.
