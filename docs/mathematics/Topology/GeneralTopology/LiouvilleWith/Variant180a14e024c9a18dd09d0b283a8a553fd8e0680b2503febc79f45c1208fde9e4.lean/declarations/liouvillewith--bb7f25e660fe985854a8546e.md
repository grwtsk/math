## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:62c470d3-671f-5ef4-11eb-1b0deb51f212`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 332–342.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem liouvilleWith (hx : Liouville x) (p : ℝ) : LiouvilleWith p x := by
  suffices LiouvilleWith ⌈p⌉₊ x from this.mono (Nat.le_ceil p)
  refine ⟨1, ((eventually_gt_atTop 1).and_frequently (hx.frequently_exists_num ⌈p⌉₊)).mono ?_⟩
  rintro b ⟨_hb, a, hne, hlt⟩
  refine ⟨a, hne, ?_⟩
  rwa [rpow_natCast]

end Liouville

/-- A number satisfies the Liouville condition with any exponent if and only if it is a Liouville
number. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LiouvilleWith/Variant180a14e024c9a18dd09d0b283a8a553fd8e0680b2503febc79f45c1208fde9e4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LiouvilleWith/Variant180a14e024c9a18dd09d0b283a8a553fd8e0680b2503febc79f45c1208fde9e4.lean#L332).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c0dd2014c0a01e0e0063769442a03b012709edc8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
