## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e0a0ad15-315c-d1fa-e5d2-327dfec8e955`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 213–220.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma norm_le_iff_le_algebraMap (a : A) {r : ℝ} (hr : 0 ≤ r) (ha : 0 ≤ a := by cfc_tac) :
    ‖a‖ ≤ r ↔ a ≤ algebraMap ℝ A r := by
  rw [le_algebraMap_iff_spectrum_le]
  obtain (h | _) := subsingleton_or_nontrivial A
  · simp [Subsingleton.elim a 0, hr]
  · exact ⟨fun h x hx ↦ Real.le_norm_self x |>.trans (spectrum.norm_le_norm_of_mem hx) |>.trans h,
      fun h ↦ h ‖a‖ <| norm_mem_spectrum_of_nonneg⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Order/Variantec17083131dc08cf81cd76a9077ca69390a772670c984dc4d80921af447d0149.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Order/Variantec17083131dc08cf81cd76a9077ca69390a772670c984dc4d80921af447d0149.lean#L213).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ecb8aff199709e4025859741470e658246b3f3b2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
