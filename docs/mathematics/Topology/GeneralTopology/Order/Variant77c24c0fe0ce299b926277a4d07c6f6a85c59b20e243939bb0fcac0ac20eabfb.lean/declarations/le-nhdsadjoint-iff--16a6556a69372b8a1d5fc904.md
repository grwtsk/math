## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7d5f1bd0-55fd-6a03-3cb1-5abd3e639717`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 595–598.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem le_nhdsAdjoint_iff {α : Type*} (a : α) (f : Filter α) (t : TopologicalSpace α) :
    t ≤ nhdsAdjoint a f ↔ @nhds α t a ≤ pure a ⊔ f ∧ ∀ b ≠ a, IsOpen[t] {b} := by
  simp only [le_nhdsAdjoint_iff', @isOpen_singleton_iff_nhds_eq_pure α t]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Order/Variant77c24c0fe0ce299b926277a4d07c6f6a85c59b20e243939bb0fcac0ac20eabfb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Order/Variant77c24c0fe0ce299b926277a4d07c6f6a85c59b20e243939bb0fcac0ac20eabfb.lean#L595).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f43df944e428b066958ebdfbf7babca6642b0d5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
