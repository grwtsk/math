## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5189afc1-a0e3-e571-5638-66b101eb726a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 438–445.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem preimage_nhds_coinduced [TopologicalSpace α] {π : α → β} {s : Set β} {a : α}
    (hs : s ∈ @nhds β (TopologicalSpace.coinduced π ‹_›) (π a)) : π ⁻¹' s ∈ 𝓝 a := by
  let := TopologicalSpace.coinduced π ‹_›
  rcases mem_nhds_iff.mp hs with ⟨V, hVs, V_op, mem_V⟩
  exact mem_nhds_iff.mpr ⟨π ⁻¹' V, Set.preimage_mono hVs, V_op, mem_V⟩

variable {t t₁ t₂ : TopologicalSpace α} {t' : TopologicalSpace β} {f : α → β} {g : β → α}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Order/Variant412d58084e0787eb8af7cace6bcc5e2910366cb4c62a0c7ce9a72cc2bd9c8f88.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Order/Variant412d58084e0787eb8af7cace6bcc5e2910366cb4c62a0c7ce9a72cc2bd9c8f88.lean#L438).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `41a336a425f6a3f8651adfef328824c14c65632b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
