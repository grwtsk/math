## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:565fe347-00dc-8bd7-bfa9-eec7d33830db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–132.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nhds_mkOfNhds (n : α → Filter α) (a : α) (h₀ : pure ≤ n)
    (h₁ : ∀ a s, s ∈ n a → ∃ t ∈ n a, t ⊆ s ∧ ∀ a' ∈ t, s ∈ n a') :
    @nhds α (TopologicalSpace.mkOfNhds n) a = n a := by
  letI := TopologicalSpace.mkOfNhds n
  apply le_antisymm <;> intros s hs
  · have h₀ : { b | s ∈ n b } ⊆ s := fun b hb => mem_pure.1 <| h₀ b hb
    have h₁ : { b | s ∈ n b } ∈ 𝓝 a := by
      refine' IsOpen.mem_nhds (fun b (hb : s ∈ n b) => _) hs
      rcases h₁ _ _ hb with ⟨t, ht, -, h⟩

    exact mem_of_superset h₁ h₀

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Order/Variant078c457f68fbb5ec628c61a0b8e4c3f8c5ed89d15c9db9940797cf11d341878c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Order/Variant078c457f68fbb5ec628c61a0b8e4c3f8c5ed89d15c9db9940797cf11d341878c.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `136aa517e684d22a8f9f80eb74e71f4f42251704` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
