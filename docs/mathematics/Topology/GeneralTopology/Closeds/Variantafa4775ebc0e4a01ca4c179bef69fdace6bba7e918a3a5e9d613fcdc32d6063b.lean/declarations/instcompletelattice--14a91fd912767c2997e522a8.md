## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:03d1608a0c2c7b99f0c6e0c8159d4ccc61efcc582322007388cdfda54f94e06e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 101–121.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instCompleteLattice : CompleteLattice (Closeds α) :=
  CompleteLattice.copy
    (GaloisInsertion.liftCompleteLattice gi)
    -- le
    _ rfl
    -- top
    ⟨univ, isClosed_univ⟩ rfl
    -- bot
    ⟨∅, isClosed_empty⟩ (SetLike.coe_injective closure_empty.symm)
    -- sup
    (fun s t => ⟨s ∪ t, s.2.union t.2⟩)
    (funext fun s => funext fun t => SetLike.coe_injective (s.2.union t.2).closure_eq.symm)
    -- inf
    (fun s t => ⟨s ∩ t, s.2.inter t.2⟩) rfl
    -- sSup
    _ rfl
    -- sInf
    (fun S => ⟨⋂ s ∈ S, ↑s, isClosed_biInter fun s _ => s.2⟩)
    (funext fun _ => SetLike.coe_injective sInf_image.symm)

/-- The type of closed sets is inhabited, with default element the empty set. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Closeds/Variantafa4775ebc0e4a01ca4c179bef69fdace6bba7e918a3a5e9d613fcdc32d6063b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Closeds/Variantafa4775ebc0e4a01ca4c179bef69fdace6bba7e918a3a5e9d613fcdc32d6063b.lean#L101).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d7a54c643bb78f8ced2299eba563fcc50d7cda48` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
