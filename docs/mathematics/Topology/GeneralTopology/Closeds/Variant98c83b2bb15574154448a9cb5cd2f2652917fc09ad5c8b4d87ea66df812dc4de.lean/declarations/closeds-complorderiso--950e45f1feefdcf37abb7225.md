## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9d3d97122c3aba5b4c15777e5ed26ed2f2e69f4e32873026e2cff85d65c2a7d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 228–237.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Closeds.complOrderIso : Closeds α ≃o (Opens α)ᵒᵈ where
  toFun := OrderDual.toDual ∘ Closeds.compl
  invFun := Opens.compl ∘ OrderDual.ofDual
  left_inv s := by simp [Closeds.compl_compl]
  right_inv s := by simp [Opens.compl_compl]
  map_rel_iff' := (@OrderDual.toDual_le_toDual (Opens α)).trans compl_subset_compl

/-- `TopologicalSpace.Opens.compl` as an `OrderIso` to the order dual of
`TopologicalSpace.Closeds α`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Closeds/Variant98c83b2bb15574154448a9cb5cd2f2652917fc09ad5c8b4d87ea66df812dc4de.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Closeds/Variant98c83b2bb15574154448a9cb5cd2f2652917fc09ad5c8b4d87ea66df812dc4de.lean#L228).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6673e92549d793b23444c591bf7a2fb2d207b57e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
