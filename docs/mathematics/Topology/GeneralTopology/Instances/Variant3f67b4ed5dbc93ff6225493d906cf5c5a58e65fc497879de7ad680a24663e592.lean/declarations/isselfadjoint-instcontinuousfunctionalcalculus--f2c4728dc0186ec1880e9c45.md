## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:51eb3cfe3ed14ac7186c2967a2104448c44b6d91b4fa66c7a3a68dcceb41c4db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 234–241.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance IsSelfAdjoint.instContinuousFunctionalCalculus :
    ContinuousFunctionalCalculus ℝ A IsSelfAdjoint :=
  SpectrumRestricts.cfc (q := IsStarNormal) (p := IsSelfAdjoint) Complex.reCLM
    Complex.isometry_ofReal.isClosedEmbedding (.zero _)
    (fun _ ↦ isSelfAdjoint_iff_isStarNormal_and_quasispectrumRestricts)

@[deprecated "Use `ContinuousFunctionalCalculus.spectrum_nonempty a ha` instead."
    (since := "2026-03-08")]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Instances/Variant3f67b4ed5dbc93ff6225493d906cf5c5a58e65fc497879de7ad680a24663e592.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Instances/Variant3f67b4ed5dbc93ff6225493d906cf5c5a58e65fc497879de7ad680a24663e592.lean#L234).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0cbdf1ff20c30af0073cf851a2f0988e8c522e45` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
