## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5f2a86d0-bd9f-3c6f-68fc-09ae639dd8bf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 29–37.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem spectrum_continuous {A : ℝ} (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    Continuous (actualTiltStandardSpectrum A) := by
  have hh : Continuous (𝓕 (fun x => (actualUnitTilt A x : ℂ))) :=
    VectorFourier.fourierIntegral_continuous Real.continuous_fourierChar
      (innerSL ℝ).continuous₂ (actualUnitTilt_complex_integrable hA)
  have he : (𝓕 (fun x => (actualUnitTilt A x : ℂ))) = actualTiltStandardSpectrum A :=
    funext (actualUnitTilt_fourier_eq hA)
  rwa [he] at hh

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualTiltProjectedGrowth/Variant0104d1e17f0bf3b2ee38b716964bd7317ad6ee92b7646abd57c4e2dcae630d56.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualTiltProjectedGrowth/Variant0104d1e17f0bf3b2ee38b716964bd7317ad6ee92b7646abd57c4e2dcae630d56.lean#L29).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `125c391b12486ccb1f098e66a0857e73a1c6854e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
