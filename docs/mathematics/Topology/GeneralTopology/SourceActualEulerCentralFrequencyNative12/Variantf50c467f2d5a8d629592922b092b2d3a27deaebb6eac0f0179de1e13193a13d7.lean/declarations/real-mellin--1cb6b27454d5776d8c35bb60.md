## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7d4208a3-217f-3903-7960-9bd863476dc5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 279–287.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem real_mellin {A : ℝ} (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    actualInitialPrimeMellin A (3 / 2) =
      ((A / sourceNormalization A * (9 / 16) * realBumpMass A ^ 2 : ℝ) : ℂ) := by
  rw [actualInitialPrimeMellin_eq_bumpMellinWeight hA]
  unfold bumpMellinWeight
  norm_num
  rw [bump_real_eq]
  ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualEulerCentralFrequencyNative12/Variantf50c467f2d5a8d629592922b092b2d3a27deaebb6eac0f0179de1e13193a13d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/SourceActualEulerCentralFrequencyNative12/Variantf50c467f2d5a8d629592922b092b2d3a27deaebb6eac0f0179de1e13193a13d7.lean#L279).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5661011680c034ce23a08bc04f78b1636eba9c83` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
