## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:929b0def-c3cb-2541-4bcc-7ed5f7ae13ec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 292–299.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem subset_closure_inter_of_isPreirreducible_of_isOpen {S U : Set X} (hS : IsPreirreducible S)
    (hU : IsOpen U) (h : (S ∩ U).Nonempty) : S ⊆ closure (S ∩ U) := by
  by_contra h'
  obtain ⟨x, h₁, h₂, h₃⟩ :=
    hS _ (closure (S ∩ U))ᶜ hU isClosed_closure.isOpen_compl h (inter_compl_nonempty_iff.mpr h')
  exact h₃ (subset_closure ⟨h₁, h₂⟩)

/-- If `∅ ≠ U ⊆ S ⊆ t` such that `U` is open and `t` is preirreducible, then `S` is irreducible. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Irreducible/Variant2947f22715e7064ab7481fb45d0aafdc5905e3d23f8515320e2993c4922b59c6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Irreducible/Variant2947f22715e7064ab7481fb45d0aafdc5905e3d23f8515320e2993c4922b59c6.lean#L292).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a04a9d2ee81a1b2496e17675a035a0ec021b2f8c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
