## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:85e0487b-44de-2573-f9b3-612d9af3b389`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 201–211.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem FP_partition_regular {M} [Semigroup M] (a : Stream' M) (s : Set (Set M)) (sfin : s.Finite)
    (scov : ∀ m, FP a m → m ∈ ⋃₀ s) : ∃ c ∈ s, ∃ b : Stream' M, ∀ m, FP b m → m ∈ c :=
  let ⟨U, idem, aU⟩ := exists_idempotent_ultrafilter_le_FP a
  let ⟨c, cs, hc⟩ :=
    (Ultrafilter.finite_sUnion_mem_iff sfin).mp (mem_of_superset aU (Set.ofPred_subset.2 scov))
  ⟨c, cs, exists_FP_of_large U idem c hc⟩

parts contains an FP-set. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hindman/Variant9c3327b9ebedd8b4d3442caf61877b9c7c25d17b572a5268c369f96b775d0370.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hindman/Variant9c3327b9ebedd8b4d3442caf61877b9c7c25d17b572a5268c369f96b775d0370.lean#L201).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `98ae06fd9e57ec6ba1a45c2da36442ec32bb7c2e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
