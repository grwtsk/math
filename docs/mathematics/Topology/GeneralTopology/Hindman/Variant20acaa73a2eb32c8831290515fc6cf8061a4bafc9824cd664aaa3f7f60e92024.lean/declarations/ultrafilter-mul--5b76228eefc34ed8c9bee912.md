## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9942938c62ab0d87d10f91a9767ea50c9548b8f2e1612011c71073edaa02b362`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 51–59.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Ultrafilter.mul {M} [Mul M] : Mul (Ultrafilter M) where mul U V := (· * ·) <$> U <*> V
#align ultrafilter.has_mul Ultrafilter.mul
#align ultrafilter.has_add Ultrafilter.add

attribute [local instance] Ultrafilter.mul Ultrafilter.add

/- We could have taken this as the definition of `U * V`, but then we would have to prove that it
defines an ultrafilter. -/
@[to_additive]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hindman/Variant20acaa73a2eb32c8831290515fc6cf8061a4bafc9824cd664aaa3f7f60e92024.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hindman/Variant20acaa73a2eb32c8831290515fc6cf8061a4bafc9824cd664aaa3f7f60e92024.lean#L51).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f6bb1c6db54ca2124297ce7094ea64406de55ecf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
