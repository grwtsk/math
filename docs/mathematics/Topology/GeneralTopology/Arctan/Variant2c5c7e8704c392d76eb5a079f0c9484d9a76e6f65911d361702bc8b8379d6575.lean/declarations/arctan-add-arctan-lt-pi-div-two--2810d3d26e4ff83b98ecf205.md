## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:43527a88-bd18-817c-e77a-b0dfed882c43`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 284–291.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma arctan_add_arctan_lt_pi_div_two (h : x * y < 1) : arctan x + arctan y < π / 2 := by
  rcases le_or_gt y 0 with hy | hy
  · rw [← add_zero (π / 2), ← arctan_zero]
    exact add_lt_add_of_lt_of_le (arctan_lt_pi_div_two _) (tanOrderIso.symm.monotone hy)
  · rw [← lt_div_iff₀ hy, ← inv_eq_one_div] at h
    replace h : arctan x < arctan y⁻¹ := tanOrderIso.symm.strictMono h
    rwa [arctan_inv_of_pos hy, lt_tsub_iff_right] at h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Arctan/Variant2c5c7e8704c392d76eb5a079f0c9484d9a76e6f65911d361702bc8b8379d6575.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Arctan/Variant2c5c7e8704c392d76eb5a079f0c9484d9a76e6f65911d361702bc8b8379d6575.lean#L284).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77da4ae6756801f991387a08cd4481be4143e1c4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
