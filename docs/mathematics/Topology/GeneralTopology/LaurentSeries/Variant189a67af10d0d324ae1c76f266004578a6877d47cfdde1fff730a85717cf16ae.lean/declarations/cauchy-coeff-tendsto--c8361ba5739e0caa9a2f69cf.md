## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:701584c0-9215-d2a1-5e12-3a4e61bcfde0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 740–754.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem Cauchy.coeff_tendsto {ℱ : Filter K⸨X⸩} (hℱ : Cauchy ℱ) (D : ℤ) :
    Tendsto (fun f : K⸨X⸩ ↦ f.coeff D) ℱ (𝓟 {coeff hℱ D}) :=
  let _ : UniformSpace K := ⊥

/- For every Cauchy filter of Laurent series, there is a `N` such that the `n`-th coefficient
vanishes for all `n ≤ N` and almost all series in the filter. This is an auxiliary lemma used
to construct the limit of the Cauchy filter as a Laurent series, ensuring that the support of the
limit is `PWO`.
The result is true also for more general Hahn Series indexed over a partially ordered group `Γ`
beyond the special case `Γ = ℤ`, that corresponds to Laurent Series: nevertheless the proof below
does not generalise, as it relies on the study of the `X`-adic valuation attached to the height-one
prime `X`, and this is peculiar to the one-variable setting. In the future we should prove this
result in full generality and deduce the case `Γ = ℤ` from that one. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LaurentSeries/Variant189a67af10d0d324ae1c76f266004578a6877d47cfdde1fff730a85717cf16ae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LaurentSeries/Variant189a67af10d0d324ae1c76f266004578a6877d47cfdde1fff730a85717cf16ae.lean#L740).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c782bb7017d8b673e57ef41bf349b892c94a13e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
