## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d4912eef-641c-74ad-5c2d-a5f4a2c05e47`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 329–344.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isBounded_of_bddAbove_of_bddBelow {s : Set α} (h₁ : BddAbove s) (h₂ : BddBelow s) :
    IsBounded s :=
  let ⟨u, hu⟩ := h₁
  let ⟨l, hl⟩ := h₂
  (isBounded_Icc l u).subset (fun _x hx => mem_Icc.mpr ⟨hl hx, hu hx⟩)

end CompactIccSpace

end Bounded

section Diam

variable {s : Set α} {x y z : α}

/-- The diameter of a set in a metric space. To get controllable behavior even when the diameter
should be infinite, we express it in terms of the `EMetric.diam` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bounded/Variantd91ea35ad124b203f280df4241a81a2a2dd7258f957d463d37ec80d9555ee59d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bounded/Variantd91ea35ad124b203f280df4241a81a2a2dd7258f957d463d37ec80d9555ee59d.lean#L329).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `17414866de7bb9117ba33b7fc910fa445fee5aff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
