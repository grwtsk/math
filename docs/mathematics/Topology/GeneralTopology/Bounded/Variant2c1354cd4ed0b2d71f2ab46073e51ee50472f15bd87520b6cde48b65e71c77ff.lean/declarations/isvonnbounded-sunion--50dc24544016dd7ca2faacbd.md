## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:83d4394d-54a5-c883-9caa-d55e06c71cbb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 124–134.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isVonNBounded_sUnion {S : Set (Set E)} (hS : S.Finite) :
    IsVonNBounded 𝕜 (⋃₀ S) ↔ ∀ s ∈ S, IsVonNBounded 𝕜 s := by
  rw [sUnion_eq_biUnion, isVonNBounded_biUnion hS]

end Zero

variable [SeminormedRing 𝕜] [AddZeroClass E] [TopologicalSpace E] [ContinuousAdd E]
  [DistribSMul 𝕜 E] {s t : Set E}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bounded/Variant2c1354cd4ed0b2d71f2ab46073e51ee50472f15bd87520b6cde48b65e71c77ff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bounded/Variant2c1354cd4ed0b2d71f2ab46073e51ee50472f15bd87520b6cde48b65e71c77ff.lean#L124).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `66d00f748acb5887e35769ac2433feb5a96ab665` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
