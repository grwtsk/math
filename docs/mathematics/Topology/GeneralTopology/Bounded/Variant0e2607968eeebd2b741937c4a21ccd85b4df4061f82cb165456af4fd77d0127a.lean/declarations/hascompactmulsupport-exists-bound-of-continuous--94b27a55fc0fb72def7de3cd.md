## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:05f127c7-1530-de60-8c3b-1f10e1e828e7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 99–110.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    {f : α → E} (hf : HasCompactMulSupport f) (h'f : Continuous f) : ∃ C, ∀ x, ‖f x‖ ≤ C := by

/-- A helper lemma used to prove that the (scalar or usual) product of a function that tends to one
and a bounded function tends to one. This lemma is formulated for any binary operation
`op : E → F → G` with an estimate `‖op x y‖ ≤ A * ‖x‖ * ‖y‖` for some constant A instead of
multiplication so that it can be applied to `(*)`, `flip (*)`, `(•)`, and `flip (•)`. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bounded/Variant0e2607968eeebd2b741937c4a21ccd85b4df4061f82cb165456af4fd77d0127a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bounded/Variant0e2607968eeebd2b741937c4a21ccd85b4df4061f82cb165456af4fd77d0127a.lean#L99).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2454c3d0987990656baee756b72fe22a1bb081dc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
