## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3c3eccfd-eeb5-7260-cf65-b5b977e0545d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 643–668.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem one_compContinuous [TopologicalSpace γ] (f : C(γ, α)) : (1 : α →ᵇ β).compContinuous f = 1 :=

#align bounded_continuous_function.zero_comp_continuous BoundedContinuousFunction.zero_compContinuous

end One

section LipschitzAdd

/- In this section, if `β` is an `AddMonoid` whose addition operation is Lipschitz, then we show
that the space of bounded continuous functions from `α` to `β` inherits a topological `AddMonoid`
structure, by using pointwise operations and checking that they are compatible with the uniform
distance.

Implementation note: The material in this section could have been written for `LipschitzMul`
and transported by `@[to_additive]`. We choose not to do this because this causes a few lemma
names (for example, `coe_mul`) to conflict with later lemma names for normed rings; this is only a
trivial inconvenience, but in any case there are no obvious applications of the multiplicative
version. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bounded/Variant83e1d9c7f5303e4cfa3597d20171233b28a2c156ebf3d5ea2d8f69dce5c47fb1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bounded/Variant83e1d9c7f5303e4cfa3597d20171233b28a2c156ebf3d5ea2d8f69dce5c47fb1.lean#L643).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27d2fbe28b79cb92d1c25e2ae69b7b16163015e8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
