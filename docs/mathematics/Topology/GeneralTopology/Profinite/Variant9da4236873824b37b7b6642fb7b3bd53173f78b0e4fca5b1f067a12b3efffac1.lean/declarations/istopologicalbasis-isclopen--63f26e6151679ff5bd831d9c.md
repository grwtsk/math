## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8ab62447-0b9f-e32b-d3a1-4bd3f3675731`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 64–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem isTopologicalBasis_isClopen : IsTopologicalBasis { s : Set X | IsClopen s } := by
  apply isTopologicalBasis_of_isOpen_of_nhds fun U (hU : IsClopen U) => hU.2
  intro x U hxU U_op
  have : U ∈ 𝓝 x := IsOpen.mem_nhds U_op hxU
  rcases (nhds_basis_clopen x).mem_iff.mp this with ⟨V, ⟨hxV, hV⟩, hVU : V ⊆ U⟩
  use V
  tauto

/-- Every member of an open set in a compact Hausdorff totally disconnected space
  is contained in a clopen set contained in the open set. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Profinite/Variant9da4236873824b37b7b6642fb7b3bd53173f78b0e4fca5b1f067a12b3efffac1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Profinite/Variant9da4236873824b37b7b6642fb7b3bd53173f78b0e4fca5b1f067a12b3efffac1.lean#L64).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5cca9a9fa294e526b3e00dce3c45e10033d61bca` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
