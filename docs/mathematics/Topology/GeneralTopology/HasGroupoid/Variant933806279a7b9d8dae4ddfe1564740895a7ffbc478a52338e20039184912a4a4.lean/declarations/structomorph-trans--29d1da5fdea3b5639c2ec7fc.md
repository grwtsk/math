## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:528d4305e43f66188f54facf3697fc178de0899ffde256240dc6d185126c72ab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 400–449.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    mem_groupoid := by
      /- Let c and c' be two charts in M and M''. We want to show that e' ∘ e is smooth in these
      charts, around any point x. For this, let y = e (c⁻¹ x), and consider a chart g around y.
      Then g ∘ e ∘ c⁻¹ and c' ∘ e' ∘ g⁻¹ are both smooth as e and e' are structomorphisms, so
      their composition is smooth, and it coincides with c' ∘ e' ∘ e ∘ c⁻¹ around x. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/HasGroupoid/Variant933806279a7b9d8dae4ddfe1564740895a7ffbc478a52338e20039184912a4a4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/HasGroupoid/Variant933806279a7b9d8dae4ddfe1564740895a7ffbc478a52338e20039184912a4a4.lean#L400).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
