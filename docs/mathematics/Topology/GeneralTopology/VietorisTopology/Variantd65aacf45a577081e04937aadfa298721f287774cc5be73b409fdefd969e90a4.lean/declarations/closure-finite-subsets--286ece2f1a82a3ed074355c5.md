## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:37962f34-4088-1894-0e1b-f11b0cab24a9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 455–462.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem closure_finite_subsets (s : Set α) :
    closure {K : Compacts α | (K : Set α).Finite ∧ ↑K ⊆ s} = {K : Compacts α | ↑K ⊆ closure s} := by
  change closure (SetLike.coe ⁻¹' {K : Set α | K.Finite ∧ K ⊆ s}) =
    SetLike.coe ⁻¹' (closure s).powerset
  rw [isEmbedding_coe.closure_eq_preimage_closure_image, image_preimage_eq_of_subset ?_,
    vietoris.closure_finite_subsets]
  exact fun K ⟨hK, _⟩ => ⟨⟨K, hK.isCompact⟩, rfl⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/VietorisTopology/Variantd65aacf45a577081e04937aadfa298721f287774cc5be73b409fdefd969e90a4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/VietorisTopology/Variantd65aacf45a577081e04937aadfa298721f287774cc5be73b409fdefd969e90a4.lean#L455).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2690f4417e777e7749ded9313d6da9bab371ad0b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
