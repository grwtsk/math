## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cd3ca391-5fae-9407-52b1-6a1096a0ba83`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 64–74.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem negative_endpoint_exponential_tendsto (z : ℂ) (hz : 0 < z.re) :
    Tendsto (fun A : ℝ => Complex.exp (-2*(A : ℂ)*z)) atTop (𝓝 0) := by
  rw [tendsto_zero_iff_norm_tendsto_zero]
  have h := ContinuousResearch.ActualRealMode.exp_scaled_neg_tendsto z.re hz
  convert h using 1
  ext A
  rw [Complex.norm_exp]
  congr 1
  norm_num [Complex.mul_re,Complex.mul_im]
  ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Attempt02/Variant7188928981392959e848455993454d9db9dde4959532259c32a1ae78bc3866cf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Attempt02/Variant7188928981392959e848455993454d9db9dde4959532259c32a1ae78bc3866cf.lean#L64).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3e2c408a7e5872f89b93d70b6b8ae6457d1b6349` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
