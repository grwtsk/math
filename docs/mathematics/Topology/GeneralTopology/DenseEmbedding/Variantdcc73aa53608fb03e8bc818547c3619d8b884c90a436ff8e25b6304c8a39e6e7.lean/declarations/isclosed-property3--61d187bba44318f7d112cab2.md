## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fe803b68-09e9-48d6-f147-00e2632091f4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 345–352.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem isClosed_property3 [TopologicalSpace β] {e : α → β} {p : β → β → β → Prop}
    (he : DenseRange e) (hp : IsClosed { q : β × β × β | p q.1 q.2.1 q.2.2 })
    (h : ∀ a₁ a₂ a₃, p (e a₁) (e a₂) (e a₃)) : ∀ b₁ b₂ b₃, p b₁ b₂ b₃ :=

  fun b₁ b₂ b₃ => this ⟨b₁, b₂, b₃⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/DenseEmbedding/Variantdcc73aa53608fb03e8bc818547c3619d8b884c90a436ff8e25b6304c8a39e6e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/DenseEmbedding/Variantdcc73aa53608fb03e8bc818547c3619d8b884c90a436ff8e25b6304c8a39e6e7.lean#L345).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `70612eb0eb555b17815e744a679f4741e07d9717` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
