## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:457b836e-f1c2-bc47-ecf3-7ec6ebdc5b77`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_comap_nhds_nhds {d : δ} {a : α} (di : IsDenseInducing i)
    (H : Tendsto h (𝓝 d) (𝓝 (i a))) (comm : h ∘ g = i ∘ f) : Tendsto f (comap g (𝓝 d)) (𝓝 a) := by
  have lim1 : map g (comap g (𝓝 d)) ≤ 𝓝 d := map_comap_le
  replace lim1 : map h (map g (comap g (𝓝 d))) ≤ map h (𝓝 d) := map_mono lim1
  rw [Filter.map_map, comm, ← Filter.map_map, map_le_iff_le_comap] at lim1
  have lim2 : comap i (map h (𝓝 d)) ≤ comap i (𝓝 (i a)) := comap_mono H
  rw [← di.nhds_eq_comap] at lim2
  exact le_trans lim1 lim2

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/DenseEmbedding/Variantdcc73aa53608fb03e8bc818547c3619d8b884c90a436ff8e25b6304c8a39e6e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/DenseEmbedding/Variantdcc73aa53608fb03e8bc818547c3619d8b884c90a436ff8e25b6304c8a39e6e7.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `70612eb0eb555b17815e744a679f4741e07d9717` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
