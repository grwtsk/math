## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:76d7649c89277066a01132055f5c9b68bde7f95c695cf1cafd6153429492c4a1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 174–192.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def majorGateAuthorityClass? (name : String) : Option String :=
  if majorTheoremObligationPatterns.any (fun pattern =>
      manifestGatePatternMatches pattern name) then
    some "theorem_obligation"
  else if majorConstructionInputPatterns.any (fun pattern =>
      manifestGatePatternMatches pattern name) then
    some "construction_input"
  else if finiteStructuralInputPatterns.any (fun pattern =>
      manifestGatePatternMatches pattern name) then
    some "finite_structural_input"
  else if readinessDashboardPatterns.any (fun pattern =>
      manifestGatePatternMatches pattern name) then
    some "readiness_dashboard"
  else if certificateGatePatterns.any (fun pattern =>
      manifestGatePatternMatches pattern name) then
    some "certificate_gate"
  else
    none

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Export/Variantd93f68b1348877cc12131116515c5fc6bbb04f9b43f136e5712486c1b345a97b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Export/Variantd93f68b1348877cc12131116515c5fc6bbb04f9b43f136e5712486c1b345a97b.lean#L174).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `445735cc7fe93e279ac0e830eaaba311dfff0e6f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
