## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:798d88e3-bb4b-1957-60bf-874b3098d0e0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–56.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sup_orthogonal_inf_of_hasOrthogonalProjection {K₁ K₂ : Submodule 𝕜 E} (h : K₁ ≤ K₂)
    [K₁.HasOrthogonalProjection] : K₁ ⊔ K₁ᗮ ⊓ K₂ = K₂ := by
  ext x

  · exact fun hx => ⟨v, v.prop, x - v, ⟨hvm, K₂.sub_mem hx (h v.prop)⟩, add_sub_cancel _ _⟩

variable {K} in
/-- If `K` admits an orthogonal projection, then `K` and `Kᗮ` span the whole space. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Submodule/Variant7d59dbf5a38fe0c6065d6ad9834e59ca3ac33558c6f8642846ce60d74195deb4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Submodule/Variant7d59dbf5a38fe0c6065d6ad9834e59ca3ac33558c6f8642846ce60d74195deb4.lean#L44).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `645ecd35577ed338fe39a1b3125d43595865111b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
