## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4824e928-ac1d-31c0-15e1-e9186fedefcd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 101–110.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma le_orthogonal_iff_le_orthogonal {K₀ K₁ : Submodule 𝕜 E} [K₀.HasOrthogonalProjection]
    [K₁.HasOrthogonalProjection] : K₀ ≤ K₁ᗮ ↔ K₁ ≤ K₀ᗮ := by
  rw [← orthogonal_le_orthogonal_iff, orthogonal_orthogonal]

/-- In a Hilbert space, the orthogonal complement of the orthogonal complement of a subspace `K`
is the topological closure of `K`.

Note that the completeness assumption is necessary. Let `E` be the space `ℕ →₀ ℝ` with inner space
structure inherited from `PiLp 2 (fun _ : ℕ ↦ ℝ)`. Let `K` be the subspace of sequences with the sum
of all elements equal to zero. Then `Kᗮ = ⊥`, `Kᗮᗮ = ⊤`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Submodule/Variant7d59dbf5a38fe0c6065d6ad9834e59ca3ac33558c6f8642846ce60d74195deb4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Submodule/Variant7d59dbf5a38fe0c6065d6ad9834e59ca3ac33558c6f8642846ce60d74195deb4.lean#L101).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `645ecd35577ed338fe39a1b3125d43595865111b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
