## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:11491c60-52dc-85ee-d59d-fd377b4e8a5a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 349–357.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isOpen_controlledPivotDomain (I : Fin k ↪o Fin n) :
    IsOpen (controlledPivotDomain I) := by
  apply isOpen_lt continuous_const
  apply Continuous.abs
  apply Continuous.matrix_det
  exact continuous_matrix (fun i j =>
    (continuous_apply (I j)).comp (continuous_apply i))

/-- The prescribed open controlled family covers every orthonormal frame. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/BoundsRound3Source/Variant0377a280998231f0d529a21a522e647fc85a4e0d8c97b2c403b41229da8c17f4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/BoundsRound3Source/Variant0377a280998231f0d529a21a522e647fc85a4e0d8c97b2c403b41229da8c17f4.lean#L349).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8352748bd2c0f99dbb9a5d95ebb59b0daa8cc180` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
