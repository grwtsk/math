## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dd708edd71a7f4ff9f5d601332ecfd46d3dbe849ed1df09f02314dfa4e3aa527`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 286–306.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Inf (Finpartition a) :=
  ⟨fun P Q ↦
    ofErase ((P.parts ×ˢ Q.parts).image fun bc ↦ bc.1 ⊓ bc.2)
      (by
        rw [supIndep_iff_disjoint_erase]
        simp only [mem_image, and_imp, exists_prop, forall_exists_index, id.def, Prod.exists,
          mem_product, Finset.disjoint_sup_right, mem_erase, Ne.def]
        rintro _ x₁ y₁ hx₁ hy₁ rfl _ h x₂ y₂ hx₂ hy₂ rfl

        trans P.parts.sup id ⊓ Q.parts.sup id
        · simp_rw [Finset.sup_inf_distrib_right, Finset.sup_inf_distrib_left]
          rfl
        · rw [P.supParts, Q.supParts, inf_idem])⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Finpartition/Variante54e01830923efcc4e6bbb247738656637b3551c890e0f4fbf573541cceb52a9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Finpartition/Variante54e01830923efcc4e6bbb247738656637b3551c890e0f4fbf573541cceb52a9.lean#L286).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d059817032a9818208e391e4e2f2577821e7c60b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
