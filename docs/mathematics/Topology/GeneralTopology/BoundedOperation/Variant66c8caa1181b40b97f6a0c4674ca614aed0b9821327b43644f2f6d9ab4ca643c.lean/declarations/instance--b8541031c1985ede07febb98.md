## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bd9c226997970c8d6796fd69e812bfece82e9ec24f9f28002becedc63032bc1d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 254–264.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : BoundedMul ℝ≥0 where
  isBounded_mul {s t} hs ht := by
    obtain ⟨Af, hAf⟩ := (isBounded_iff_subset_closedBall 0).mp hs
    obtain ⟨Ag, hAg⟩ := (isBounded_iff_subset_closedBall 0).mp ht
    have key : IsCompact (closedBall (0 : ℝ≥0) Af ×ˢ closedBall (0 : ℝ≥0) Ag) :=
      IsCompact.prod (isCompact_closedBall _ _) (isCompact_closedBall _ _)
    apply Bornology.IsBounded.subset (key.image continuous_mul).isBounded
    intro _ ⟨x, x_in_s, y, y_in_t, xy_eq⟩
    exact ⟨⟨x, y⟩, by simpa only [Set.mem_prod] using ⟨⟨hAf x_in_s, hAg y_in_t⟩, xy_eq⟩⟩

end NNReal
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/BoundedOperation/Variant66c8caa1181b40b97f6a0c4674ca614aed0b9821327b43644f2f6d9ab4ca643c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/BoundedOperation/Variant66c8caa1181b40b97f6a0c4674ca614aed0b9821327b43644f2f6d9ab4ca643c.lean#L254).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `189f35228e7419dce7cf6875a0c89054769d7d51` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
