## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bb5988f7-9a82-5fe1-a085-dc562b818153`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 131–142.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsTopologicalBasis.mem_nhds_iff {a : α} {s : Set α} {b : Set (Set α)}
    (hb : IsTopologicalBasis b) : s ∈ 𝓝 a ↔ ∃ t ∈ b, a ∈ t ∧ t ⊆ s := by
  change s ∈ (𝓝 a).sets ↔ ∃ t ∈ b, a ∈ t ∧ t ⊆ s
  rw [hb.eq_generateFrom, nhds_generateFrom, biInf_sets_eq]
  · simp [and_assoc, and_left_comm]
  · rintro s ⟨hs₁, hs₂⟩ t ⟨ht₁, ht₂⟩
    let ⟨u, hu₁, hu₂, hu₃⟩ := hb.1 _ hs₂ _ ht₂ _ ⟨hs₁, ht₁⟩
    exact ⟨u, ⟨hu₂, hu₁⟩, le_principal_iff.2 (hu₃.trans inter_subset_left),
      le_principal_iff.2 (hu₃.trans inter_subset_right)⟩
  · rcases eq_univ_iff_forall.1 hb.sUnion_eq a with ⟨i, h1, h2⟩
    exact ⟨i, h2, h1⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bases/Variantc898eb2d3184543f0c64e6195bfff274f57a973769831068a1d5aef4bf2fa9b5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bases/Variantc898eb2d3184543f0c64e6195bfff274f57a973769831068a1d5aef4bf2fa9b5.lean#L131).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `39a4410f544346fbdcd3249f762842e98be612ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
