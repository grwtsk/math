## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:27ef752a-1d4d-0d12-8c79-539cb6e0656b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 119–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isTopologicalBasis_of_isOpen_of_nhds {s : Set (Set α)} (h_open : ∀ u ∈ s, IsOpen u)
    (h_nhds : ∀ (a : α) (u : Set α), a ∈ u → IsOpen u → ∃ v ∈ s, a ∈ v ∧ v ⊆ u) :
    IsTopologicalBasis s :=
  .of_hasBasis_nhds <| fun a ↦
    (nhds_basis_opens a).to_hasBasis' (by simpa [and_assoc] using h_nhds a)
      fun _ ⟨hts, hat⟩ ↦ (h_open _ hts).mem_nhds hat

/-- A set `s` is in the neighbourhood of `a` iff there is some basis set `t`, which
contains `a` and is itself contained in `s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bases/Variant493185ec0b182c54fa0a77850ae0989a6bccc536f44030b83fb0a654bcb827f3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bases/Variant493185ec0b182c54fa0a77850ae0989a6bccc536f44030b83fb0a654bcb827f3.lean#L119).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b83ef8435af34618046ecb4b3b0b05f85d68e8f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
