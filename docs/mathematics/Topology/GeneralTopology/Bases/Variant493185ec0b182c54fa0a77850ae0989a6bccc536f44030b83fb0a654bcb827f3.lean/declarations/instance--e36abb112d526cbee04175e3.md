## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:77a7ca6063c4b33bf1818626c3942cba6072f3bebcffa3177f61cc418beb84a5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1074–1088.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [Countable ι] [∀ i, SecondCountableTopology (E i)] :
    SecondCountableTopology (Σ i, E i) := by
  let b := ⋃ i : ι, (fun u => (Sigma.mk i '' u : Set (Σ i, E i))) '' countableBasis (E i)
  have A : IsTopologicalBasis b := IsTopologicalBasis.sigma fun i => isBasis_countableBasis _
  have B : b.Countable := countable_iUnion fun i => (countable_countableBasis _).image _
  exact A.secondCountableTopology B

end Sigma

section Sum

variable {β : Type*} [TopologicalSpace β]

/-- In a sum space `α ⊕ β`, one can form a topological basis by taking the union of
topological bases on each of the two components. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bases/Variant493185ec0b182c54fa0a77850ae0989a6bccc536f44030b83fb0a654bcb827f3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bases/Variant493185ec0b182c54fa0a77850ae0989a6bccc536f44030b83fb0a654bcb827f3.lean#L1074).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b83ef8435af34618046ecb4b3b0b05f85d68e8f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
