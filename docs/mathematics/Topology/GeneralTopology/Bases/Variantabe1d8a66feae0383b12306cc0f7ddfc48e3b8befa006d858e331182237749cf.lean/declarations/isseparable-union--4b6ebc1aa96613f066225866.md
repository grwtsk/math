## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fea87610-45bb-51ac-c1b5-da599e240a7f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 447–456.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsSeparable.union {s u : Set α} (hs : IsSeparable s) (hu : IsSeparable u) :
    IsSeparable (s ∪ u) := by
  rcases hs with ⟨cs, cs_count, hcs⟩
  rcases hu with ⟨cu, cu_count, hcu⟩
  refine' ⟨cs ∪ cu, cs_count.union cu_count, _⟩
  exact
    union_subset (hcs.trans (closure_mono (subset_union_left _ _)))
      (hcu.trans (closure_mono (subset_union_right _ _)))
#align topological_space.is_separable.union TopologicalSpace.IsSeparable.union

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bases/Variantabe1d8a66feae0383b12306cc0f7ddfc48e3b8befa006d858e331182237749cf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Bases/Variantabe1d8a66feae0383b12306cc0f7ddfc48e3b8befa006d858e331182237749cf.lean#L447).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `98d06395051f49536a70c1b3294eecd50089e4b5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
