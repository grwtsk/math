## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b84b3014-f60b-7b79-ab80-ac5ca8a66a31`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 163–185.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem banach_steinhaus (H : ∀ k x, BddAbove (range fun i ↦ q k (𝓕 i x))) :
    UniformEquicontinuous ((↑) ∘ 𝓕) := by
  -- We just have to prove that `⊔ i, (q k) ∘ (𝓕 i)` is a (well-defined) continuous seminorm
  -- for all `k`.
  refine (hq.uniformEquicontinuous_iff_bddAbove_and_continuous_iSup ((toLinearMap) ∘ 𝓕)).mpr ?_
  intro k
  -- By assumption the supremum `⊔ i, q k (𝓕 i x)` is well-defined for all `x`, hence the
  -- supremum `⊔ i, (q k) ∘ (𝓕 i)` is well defined in the lattice of seminorms.
  have : BddAbove (range fun i ↦ (q k).comp (𝓕 i).toLinearMap) := by
    rw [Seminorm.bddAbove_range_iff]
    exact H k
  -- By definition of the lattice structure on seminorms, `⊔ i, (q k) ∘ (𝓕 i)` is the *pointwise*
  -- supremum of the continuous seminorms `(q k) ∘ (𝓕 i)`. Since `E` is barrelled, this supremum
  -- is continuous.
  exact ⟨this, Seminorm.continuous_iSup _
    (fun i ↦ (hq.continuous_seminorm k).comp (𝓕 i).continuous) this⟩

/-- Given a sequence of continuous linear maps which converges pointwise and for which the
domain is barrelled, the Banach-Steinhaus theorem is used to guarantee that the limit map
is a *continuous* linear map as well.

This actually works for any *countably generated* filter instead of `AtTop : Filter ℕ`,
but the proof ultimately goes back to sequences. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Barrelled/Variante373dd4976d95a44887f80fec8d94dc4708d492d26b1c44582227babb6639463.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Barrelled/Variante373dd4976d95a44887f80fec8d94dc4708d492d26b1c44582227babb6639463.lean#L163).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `04b275fea6ec14a06b23eea6a8c9f88f8bf0de50` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
