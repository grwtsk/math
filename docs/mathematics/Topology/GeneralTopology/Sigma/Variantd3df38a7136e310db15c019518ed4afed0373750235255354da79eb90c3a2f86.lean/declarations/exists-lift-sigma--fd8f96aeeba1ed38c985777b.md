## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8afe6aaf-e532-78c3-3a69-b4a5d581c6ce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 75–86.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_lift_sigma (f : C(X, Σ i, Y i)) : ∃ i g, f = (sigmaMk i).comp g :=
  let ⟨i, g, hg, hfg⟩ := (map_continuous f).exists_lift_sigma
  ⟨i, ⟨g, hg⟩, DFunLike.ext' hfg⟩

variable (X Y)

/-- Homeomorphism between the type `C(X, Σ i, Y i)` of continuous maps from a connected topological
space to the disjoint union of a family of topological spaces and the disjoint union of the types of
continuous maps `C(X, Y i)`.

The inverse map sends `⟨i, g⟩` to `ContinuousMap.comp (ContinuousMap.sigmaMk i) g`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Sigma/Variantd3df38a7136e310db15c019518ed4afed0373750235255354da79eb90c3a2f86.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Sigma/Variantd3df38a7136e310db15c019518ed4afed0373750235255354da79eb90c3a2f86.lean#L75).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ad4916eb4c0f77b01c8b2776cfd0a919b7c76df1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
