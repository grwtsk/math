## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:afae1e08cb15ec90075ef685f07428d1e823fb0eb24da429438f00fb0d4f990e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure IsLittleOTVS (l : Filter α) (f : α → E) (g : α → F) : Prop where
  exists_eventuallyLE_mul : ∀ U ∈ 𝓝 (0 : E), ∃ V ∈ 𝓝 (0 : F), ∀ ε ≠ (0 : ℝ≥0),
    (fun x ↦ egauge 𝕜 U (f x)) ≤ᶠ[l] (fun x ↦ ε * egauge 𝕜 V (g x))

@[inherit_doc]
notation:100 f " =o[" 𝕜 "; " l "] " g:100 => IsLittleOTVS 𝕜 l f g

/-- `f =O[𝕜; l] g` (`IsBigOTVS 𝕜 l f g`) is a generalization of `f =O[l] g` (`IsBigO l f g`)
that works in topological `𝕜`-vector spaces.

Given two functions `f` and `g` taking values in topological vector spaces
over a normed field `𝕜`,
we say that $f = O(g)$ if for any neighborhood of zero `U` in the codomain of `f`
there exists a neighborhood of zero `V` in the codomain of `g`
such that $\operatorname{gauge}_{K, U} (f(x)) \le \operatorname{gauge}_{K, V} (g(x))$,
where $\operatorname{gauge}_{K, U}(y) = \inf \{‖c‖ \mid y ∈ c • U\}$.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/TVS/Variant67f3e675c2a75fa2ead4d60dba9607fd9c0751eed8ec8154738b439a42e897c7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/TVS/Variant67f3e675c2a75fa2ead4d60dba9607fd9c0751eed8ec8154738b439a42e897c7.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5624ae2be391f87ef07b2377952d05a28e73510e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
