## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:afa5d243-cdb9-3b82-4a1d-11b4806245ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsLittleOTVS.exists_eventuallyLE_mul_ennreal (h : f =o[𝕜; l] g) {U : Set E} (hU : U ∈ 𝓝 0) :
    ∃ V ∈ 𝓝 (0 : F), ∀ ε ≠ 0, (fun x ↦ egauge 𝕜 U (f x)) ≤ᶠ[l] (fun x ↦ ε * egauge 𝕜 V (g x)) := by
  obtain ⟨V, hV₀, hV⟩ := h.exists_eventuallyLE_mul U hU
  refine ⟨V, hV₀, fun ε hε ↦ ?_⟩
  cases ε with
  | top => exact (hV 1 one_ne_zero).trans <| .of_forall fun _ ↦ mul_le_mul_right' le_top _
  | coe ε => exact hV ε (mod_cast hε)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/TVS/Variant802f6abe48b4dc96afbb832be0d242376f01abd2edc2dbfcdee7ce34b6794b33.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/TVS/Variant802f6abe48b4dc96afbb832be0d242376f01abd2edc2dbfcdee7ce34b6794b33.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b4d1414f6409bd8837ab6212ea881887616138ca` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
