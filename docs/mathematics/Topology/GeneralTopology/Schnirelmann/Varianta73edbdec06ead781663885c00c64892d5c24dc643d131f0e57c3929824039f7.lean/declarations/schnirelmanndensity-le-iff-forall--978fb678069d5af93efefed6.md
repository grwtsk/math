## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:73e64a38-690f-1ca4-a535-85ce9b0d7f75`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 162–167.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma schnirelmannDensity_le_iff_forall {x : ℝ} :
    schnirelmannDensity A ≤ x ↔
      ∀ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε → ∃ n : ℕ, 0 < n ∧ #{a ∈ Ioc 0 n | a ∈ A} / n < x + ε := by
  rw [le_iff_forall_pos_lt_add]
  simp only [schnirelmannDensity_lt_iff]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Schnirelmann/Varianta73edbdec06ead781663885c00c64892d5c24dc643d131f0e57c3929824039f7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Schnirelmann/Varianta73edbdec06ead781663885c00c64892d5c24dc643d131f0e57c3929824039f7.lean#L162).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1c44341143936b30113df63cb4626bb8d3ede465` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
