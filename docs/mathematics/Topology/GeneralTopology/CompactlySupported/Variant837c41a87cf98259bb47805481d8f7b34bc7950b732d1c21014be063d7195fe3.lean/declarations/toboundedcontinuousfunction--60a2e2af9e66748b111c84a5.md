## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0289ad85d09cba793b6e48dc3e9ab71cf691cb9bbe8dec373dd61b654f6163d9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 162–182.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simps] def toBoundedContinuousFunction {β : Type*} [PseudoMetricSpace β] [Zero β]
    (f : C_c(α, β)) : BoundedContinuousFunction α β where
  toFun := f
  map_bounded' := by
    have : IsCompact (Set.range f) := f.hasCompactSupport.isCompact_range f.continuous
    rcases Metric.isBounded_iff.1 this.isBounded with ⟨C, hC⟩
    exact ⟨C, by grind⟩

end Basics

/-! ### Algebraic structure

Whenever `β` has the structure of continuous additive monoid and a compatible topological structure,
then `C_c(α, β)` inherits a corresponding algebraic structure. The primary exception to this is that
`C_c(α, β)` will not have a multiplicative identity.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactlySupported/Variant837c41a87cf98259bb47805481d8f7b34bc7950b732d1c21014be063d7195fe3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/CompactlySupported/Variant837c41a87cf98259bb47805481d8f7b34bc7950b732d1c21014be063d7195fe3.lean#L162).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `756663c8d2496bfcef23a2d7e7545579bcc4bdf7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
