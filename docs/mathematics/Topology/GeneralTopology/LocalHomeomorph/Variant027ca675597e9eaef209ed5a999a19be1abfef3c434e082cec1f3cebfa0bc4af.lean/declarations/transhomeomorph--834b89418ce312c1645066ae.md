## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:556caa4c0010a6c1d27d8c66e12a58a7e25960e45d4364973c48efb9fd9cc8d1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 911–918.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def transHomeomorph (e' : β ≃ₜ γ) : LocalHomeomorph α γ where
  toLocalEquiv := e.toLocalEquiv.transEquiv e'.toEquiv
  open_source := e.open_source
  open_target := e.open_target.preimage e'.symm.continuous
  continuous_toFun := e'.continuous.comp_continuousOn e.continuousOn
  continuous_invFun := e.symm.continuousOn.comp e'.symm.continuous.continuousOn fun _ => id
#align local_homeomorph.trans_homeomorph LocalHomeomorph.transHomeomorph

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalHomeomorph/Variant027ca675597e9eaef209ed5a999a19be1abfef3c434e082cec1f3cebfa0bc4af.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalHomeomorph/Variant027ca675597e9eaef209ed5a999a19be1abfef3c434e082cec1f3cebfa0bc4af.lean#L911).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4268fa7d860daa2aa74904910f3337891c3a4b4e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
