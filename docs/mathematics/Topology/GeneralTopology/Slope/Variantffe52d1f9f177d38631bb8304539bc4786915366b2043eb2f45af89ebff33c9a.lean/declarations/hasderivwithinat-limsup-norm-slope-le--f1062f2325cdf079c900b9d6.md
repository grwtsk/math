## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3c9397fc-9ba4-16ec-7894-c0b3531fa819`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 132–152.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- If `f` has derivative `f'` within `s` at `x`, then for any `r > ‖f'‖` the ratio
`(‖f z‖ - ‖f x‖) / ‖z - x‖` is less than `r` in some neighborhood of `x` within `s`.
In other words, the limit superior of this ratio as `z` tends to `x` along `s`
is less than or equal to `‖f'‖`.

This lemma is a weaker version of `HasDerivWithinAt.limsup_norm_slope_le`
where `‖f z‖ - ‖f x‖` is replaced by `‖f z - f x‖`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Slope/Variantffe52d1f9f177d38631bb8304539bc4786915366b2043eb2f45af89ebff33c9a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Slope/Variantffe52d1f9f177d38631bb8304539bc4786915366b2043eb2f45af89ebff33c9a.lean#L132).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `379585a1ff78c666b0e0b68f37f83d60e417e80c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
