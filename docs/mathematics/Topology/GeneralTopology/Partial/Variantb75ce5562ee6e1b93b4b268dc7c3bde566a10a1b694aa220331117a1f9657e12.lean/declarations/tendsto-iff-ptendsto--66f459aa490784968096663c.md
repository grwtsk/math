## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ee736a72-c2f6-64b3-fed6-f00b1353950e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 223–226.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_iff_ptendsto (l₁ : Filter α) (l₂ : Filter β) (s : Set α) (f : α → β) :
    Tendsto f (l₁ ⊓ 𝓟 s) l₂ ↔ PTendsto (PFun.res f s) l₁ l₂ := by
  simp only [Tendsto, PTendsto, pmap_res]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Partial/Variantb75ce5562ee6e1b93b4b268dc7c3bde566a10a1b694aa220331117a1f9657e12.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Partial/Variantb75ce5562ee6e1b93b4b268dc7c3bde566a10a1b694aa220331117a1f9657e12.lean#L223).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e1c952f4ea401743a475f2c0df802638a62720a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
