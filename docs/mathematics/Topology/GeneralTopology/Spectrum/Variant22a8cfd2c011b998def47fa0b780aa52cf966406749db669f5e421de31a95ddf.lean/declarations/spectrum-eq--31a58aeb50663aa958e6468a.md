## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eab982ef-ee24-51cd-1edb-28b60756cf4c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 232–246.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma spectrum_eq {a : S} : spectrum ℂ a = spectrum ℂ (a : A) :=
  Set.ext fun _ ↦ S.mem_spectrum_iff

end StarSubalgebra

end ComplexScalars

namespace NonUnitalStarAlgHom

variable {F A B : Type*} [NonUnitalCStarAlgebra A] [NonUnitalCStarAlgebra B]
variable [FunLike F A B] [NonUnitalAlgHomClass F ℂ A B] [StarHomClass F A B]

open Unitization

/-- A non-unital star algebra homomorphism of complex C⋆-algebras is norm contractive. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Spectrum/Variant22a8cfd2c011b998def47fa0b780aa52cf966406749db669f5e421de31a95ddf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Spectrum/Variant22a8cfd2c011b998def47fa0b780aa52cf966406749db669f5e421de31a95ddf.lean#L232).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f5a9603fbf1f74769e0c3ea58cc75febad5722c5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
