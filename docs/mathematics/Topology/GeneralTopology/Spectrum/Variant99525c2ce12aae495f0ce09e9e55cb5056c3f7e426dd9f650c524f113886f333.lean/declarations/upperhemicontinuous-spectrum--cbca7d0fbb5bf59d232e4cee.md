## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1ea44c83-8a8f-ea5a-eab3-4c5317cdba4a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 816–840.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  /- It suffices to use the sequential characterization of upper hemicontinuity.
  Suppose that `a : ℕ → A` converges to `a₀`, `x : ℕ → 𝕜` converges to `x₀`, and for all `n`,
  `x n ∈ spectrum 𝕜 (a n)`. -/

  /- We must show that `spectrum 𝕜 (a n)` is eventually contained in some fixed compact set
  (we've chosen `closedBall 0 ((‖a₀‖ + 1) * ‖(1 : A)‖)`). This follows since the spectrum of any
  `b` is bounded `‖b‖ * ‖1‖` and `a` converges to `a₀`.  -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Spectrum/Variant99525c2ce12aae495f0ce09e9e55cb5056c3f7e426dd9f650c524f113886f333.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Spectrum/Variant99525c2ce12aae495f0ce09e9e55cb5056c3f7e426dd9f650c524f113886f333.lean#L816).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8fc9d56eaa04eb16e57bce8f561607390dfddca9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
