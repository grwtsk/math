## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cd7e3a8d-a9de-3822-18d4-567d7fe67f3d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 219–223.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma mem_spectrum_iff {a : S} {z : ℂ} : z ∈ spectrum ℂ a ↔ z ∈ spectrum ℂ (a : A) :=
  not_iff_not.mpr S.coe_isUnit.symm

/-- **Spectral permanence.** The spectrum of an element is invariant of the (closed)
`StarSubalgebra` in which it is contained. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Spectrum/Variant2e75f5fdebb4726c09751be728427fccae903e5b00a48fd26d1d4533d5f67ce2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Spectrum/Variant2e75f5fdebb4726c09751be728427fccae903e5b00a48fd26d1d4533d5f67ce2.lean#L219).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bf59cb683626bdb1ddf05237d1b6b5508356ead1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
