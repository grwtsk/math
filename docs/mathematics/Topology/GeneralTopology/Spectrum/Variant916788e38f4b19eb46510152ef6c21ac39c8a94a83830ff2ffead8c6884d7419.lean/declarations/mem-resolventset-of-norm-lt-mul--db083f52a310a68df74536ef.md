## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:57fa4aa0-6afa-85fd-54bf-828edf8b42ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 180–190.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  rw [resolventSet, Set.mem_ofPred_eq, Algebra.algebraMap_eq_smul_one]

  have hk : k ≠ 0 :=
    ne_zero_of_norm_ne_zero ((mul_nonneg (norm_nonneg _) (norm_nonneg _)).trans_lt h).ne'
  let ku := Units.map ↑ₐ.toMonoidHom (Units.mk0 k hk)
  rw [← inv_inv ‖(1 : A)‖,
    mul_inv_lt_iff₀' (inv_pos.2 <| norm_pos_iff.2 (one_ne_zero : (1 : A) ≠ 0))] at h
  have hku : ‖-a‖ < ‖(↑ku⁻¹ : A)‖⁻¹ := by simpa [ku, norm_algebraMap] using h
  simpa [ku, sub_eq_add_neg, Algebra.algebraMap_eq_smul_one] using (ku.add (-a) hku).isUnit

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Spectrum/Variant916788e38f4b19eb46510152ef6c21ac39c8a94a83830ff2ffead8c6884d7419.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Spectrum/Variant916788e38f4b19eb46510152ef6c21ac39c8a94a83830ff2ffead8c6884d7419.lean#L180).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9e233120cd3cfbb99ed7a3e2b0a991ebf9a9d8a7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
