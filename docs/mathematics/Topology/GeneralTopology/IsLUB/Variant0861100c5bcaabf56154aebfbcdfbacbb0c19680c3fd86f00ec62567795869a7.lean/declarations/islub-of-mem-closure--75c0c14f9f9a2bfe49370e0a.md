## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:31a471a0-f3c2-519d-b6f2-6e9e885221f3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 83–88.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isLUB_of_mem_closure {s : Set α} {a : α} (hsa : a ∈ upperBounds s) (hsf : a ∈ closure s) :
    IsLUB s a := by
  rw [mem_closure_iff_clusterPt, ClusterPt, inf_comm] at hsf
  exact isLUB_of_mem_nhds hsa (mem_principal_self s)

set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/IsLUB/Variant0861100c5bcaabf56154aebfbcdfbacbb0c19680c3fd86f00ec62567795869a7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/IsLUB/Variant0861100c5bcaabf56154aebfbcdfbacbb0c19680c3fd86f00ec62567795869a7.lean#L83).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb02c1be7a0438ffdde87cc516acc06c3a5b73bd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
