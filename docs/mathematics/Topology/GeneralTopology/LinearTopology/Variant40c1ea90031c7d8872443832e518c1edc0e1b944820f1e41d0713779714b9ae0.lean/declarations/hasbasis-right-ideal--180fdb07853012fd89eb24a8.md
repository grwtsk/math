## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cf35ec47-4ae1-3343-9d57-592a9d53accb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 296–305.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasBasis_right_ideal [IsLinearTopology Rᵐᵒᵖ R] :
    (𝓝 0).HasBasis (fun I : Submodule Rᵐᵒᵖ R ↦ (I : Set R) ∈ 𝓝 0) (fun I ↦ (I : Set R)) :=
  hasBasis_submodule Rᵐᵒᵖ

open Set Pointwise in
/-- If a ring `R` is linearly ordered as a left *and* right module over itself,
then it has a basis of neighborhoods of zero made of *two-sided* ideals.

This is usually called a *linearly topologized ring*, but we do not add a specific spelling:
you should use `[IsLinearTopology R R] [IsLinearTopology Rᵐᵒᵖ R]` instead. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LinearTopology/Variant40c1ea90031c7d8872443832e518c1edc0e1b944820f1e41d0713779714b9ae0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LinearTopology/Variant40c1ea90031c7d8872443832e518c1edc0e1b944820f1e41d0713779714b9ae0.lean#L296).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3798230fe242e60caa151b551e94ef358e22af29` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
