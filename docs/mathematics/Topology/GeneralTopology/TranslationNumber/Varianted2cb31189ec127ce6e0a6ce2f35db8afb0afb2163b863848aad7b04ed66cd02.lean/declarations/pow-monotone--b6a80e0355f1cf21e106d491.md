## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a230ef8c-5ddd-ea40-acf9-1659268af41a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 397–408.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pow_monotone (n : ℕ) : Monotone fun f : CircleDeg1Lift => f ^ n := fun _ _ h => pow_mono h n

/-!
### Estimates on `(f * g) 0`

We prove the estimates `f 0 + ⌊g 0⌋ ≤ f (g 0) ≤ f 0 + ⌈g 0⌉` and some corollaries with added/removed
floors and ceils.

We also prove that for two semiconjugate maps `g₁`, `g₂`, the distance between `g₁ 0` and `g₂ 0`
is less than two.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/TranslationNumber/Varianted2cb31189ec127ce6e0a6ce2f35db8afb0afb2163b863848aad7b04ed66cd02.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/TranslationNumber/Varianted2cb31189ec127ce6e0a6ce2f35db8afb0afb2163b863848aad7b04ed66cd02.lean#L397).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2189cde89d38a940c68fec7aac9732defd94ff80` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
