## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5d4aaab0-af5f-fbf8-7467-9ef0717f6665`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 231–244.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isUnit_iff_bijective {f : CircleDeg1Lift} : IsUnit f ↔ Bijective f :=
  ⟨fun ⟨u, h⟩ => h ▸ (toOrderIso u).bijective, fun h =>
    Units.isUnit
      { val := f
        inv :=
          { toFun := (Equiv.ofBijective f h).symm
            monotone' := fun x y hxy =>
              (f.strictMono_iff_injective.2 h.1).le_iff_le.1
                (by simp only [Equiv.ofBijective_apply_symm_apply f h, hxy])
            map_add_one' := fun x =>
              h.1 <| by simp only [Equiv.ofBijective_apply_symm_apply f, f.map_add_one] }
        val_inv := ext <| Equiv.ofBijective_apply_symm_apply f h
        inv_val := ext <| Equiv.ofBijective_symm_apply_apply f h }⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/TranslationNumber/Varianted2cb31189ec127ce6e0a6ce2f35db8afb0afb2163b863848aad7b04ed66cd02.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/TranslationNumber/Varianted2cb31189ec127ce6e0a6ce2f35db8afb0afb2163b863848aad7b04ed66cd02.lean#L231).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2189cde89d38a940c68fec7aac9732defd94ff80` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
