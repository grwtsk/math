## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:570a33f9-6784-4fae-708c-223fb2653f4e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 412–425.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem continuousWithinAt_Ioc_iff_Iic (h : a < b) :
    ContinuousWithinAt f (Ioc a b) b ↔ ContinuousWithinAt f (Iic b) b := by
  simp only [ContinuousWithinAt, nhdsWithin_Ioc_eq_nhdsLE h]

end LinearOrder

end ClosedIicTopology

section Preorder

variable [TopologicalSpace α] [Preorder α] [ClosedIciTopology α] {f : β → α} {a b : α} {s : Set α}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/OrderClosed/Variantd3e0e53645aef5943499ad4ce2ab430698cb61ddcece18af2055224c66075ed4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/OrderClosed/Variantd3e0e53645aef5943499ad4ce2ab430698cb61ddcece18af2055224c66075ed4.lean#L412).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f6fa8f6051335641899793c88fd959661b7b8d5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
