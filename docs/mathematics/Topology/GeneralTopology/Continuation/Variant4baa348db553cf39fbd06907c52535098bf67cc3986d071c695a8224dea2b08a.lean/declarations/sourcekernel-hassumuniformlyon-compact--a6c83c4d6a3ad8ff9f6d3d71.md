## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8de912ea-2698-3e2e-1199-1703b3fcbb54`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 685–698.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sourceKernel_hasSumUniformlyOn_compact
    (K : Set ℂ) (hK : IsCompact K)
    (hKD : K ⊆ convergenceDomain) :
    HasSumUniformlyOn
      (fun o : ZeroOccurrence ↦
        sourceKernel (shiftedValue o))
      (fun s ↦
        ∑' o : ZeroOccurrence,
          sourceKernel (shiftedValue o) s) K :=
  HasSumUniformlyOn.of_norm_le_summable
    (sourceKernel_compact_norms_summable K hK hKD)
    (fun o s hs ↦
      norm_le_compactKernelNorm K hK hKD o s hs)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuation/Variant4baa348db553cf39fbd06907c52535098bf67cc3986d071c695a8224dea2b08a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuation/Variant4baa348db553cf39fbd06907c52535098bf67cc3986d071c695a8224dea2b08a.lean#L685).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7789990240985152f5d5a5b6958d221afc15a01c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
