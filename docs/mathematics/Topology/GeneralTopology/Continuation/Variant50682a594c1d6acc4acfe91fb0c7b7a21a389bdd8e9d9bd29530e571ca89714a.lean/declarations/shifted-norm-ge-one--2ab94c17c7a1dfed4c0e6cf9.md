## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7766e5c8-6e61-eb5f-f573-47128f4110f4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 354–364.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem shifted_norm_ge_one
    (M : ℝ) (hM : 0 ≤ M)
    (s z : ℂ)
    (hs : ‖s‖ ≤ M)
    (hz : M + 1 ≤ ‖z‖) :
    1 ≤ ‖s - 2 * z‖ := by
  have h := norm_sub_norm_le (2 * z) s
  rw [norm_sub_rev] at h
  norm_num [norm_mul] at h
  linarith

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuation/Variant50682a594c1d6acc4acfe91fb0c7b7a21a389bdd8e9d9bd29530e571ca89714a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Continuation/Variant50682a594c1d6acc4acfe91fb0c7b7a21a389bdd8e9d9bd29530e571ca89714a.lean#L354).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3a3710f13556daec3ffb67a27b3cf5e7c9880df9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
