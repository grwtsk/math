## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b9f53cc9-277c-de01-0295-eb9aae6e07dc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 318–328.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma coprod_inl_inr : ContinuousLinearMap.coprod (.inl R M N) (.inr R M N) = .id R (M × N) :=
  coe_injective <| LinearMap.coprod_inl_inr

/-- Taking the product of two maps with the same codomain is equivalent to taking the product of
their domains.
See note [bundled maps over different rings] for why separate `R` and `S` semirings are used.

TODO: Upgrade this to a `ContinuousLinearEquiv`. This should be true for any topological
vector space over a normed field thanks to `ContinuousLinearMap.precomp` and
`ContinuousLinearMap.postcomp`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LinearMapPiProd/Variant3177f53a0567409c0bcfc5263bf1b180117b00a1a2eab20cd0202afe817e5a68.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LinearMapPiProd/Variant3177f53a0567409c0bcfc5263bf1b180117b00a1a2eab20cd0202afe817e5a68.lean#L318).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0c0cb3744fbde6ff7c1e0c6dfc4495f964f898e8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
