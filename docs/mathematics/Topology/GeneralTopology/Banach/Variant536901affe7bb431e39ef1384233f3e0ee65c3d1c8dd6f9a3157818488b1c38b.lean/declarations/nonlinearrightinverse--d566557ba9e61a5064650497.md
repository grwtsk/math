## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:93e9e49165c22b16b29dc524772a0b3aa7d156028b5aa2f4ac6345ac67077d84`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 38–47.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure NonlinearRightInverse where
  /-- The underlying function.

  Do NOT use directly. Use the coercion instead. -/
  toFun : F → E
  /-- The bound `C` so that `‖inverse x‖ ≤ C * ‖x‖` for all `x`. -/
  nnnorm : ℝ≥0
  bound' : ∀ y, ‖toFun y‖ ≤ nnnorm * ‖y‖
  right_inv' : ∀ y, f (toFun y) = y

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Banach/Variant536901affe7bb431e39ef1384233f3e0ee65c3d1c8dd6f9a3157818488b1c38b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Banach/Variant536901affe7bb431e39ef1384233f3e0ee65c3d1c8dd6f9a3157818488b1c38b.lean#L38).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `66b95fdbaf8dd1f62c28a5a0cd2613ab7d4bcc4b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
