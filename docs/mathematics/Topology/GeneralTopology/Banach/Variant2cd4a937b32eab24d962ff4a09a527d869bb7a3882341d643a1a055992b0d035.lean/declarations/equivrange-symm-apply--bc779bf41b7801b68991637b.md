## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6d5f0e5b-866a-663f-00ff-a856fe451da0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 382–402.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma equivRange_symm_apply (hinj : Injective f) (hclo : IsClosed (range f))
    (x : E) : (f.equivRange hinj hclo).symm ⟨f x, by simp⟩ = x := by
  suffices f ((f.equivRange hinj hclo).symm ⟨f x, by simp⟩) = f x from hinj this
  trans f ((f.equivRange hinj hclo).symm.toLinearEquiv ⟨f x, by simp⟩)
  · rfl -- is there an API lemma for this already?
  dsimp only [equivRange_symm_toLinearEquiv]
  set x' : LinearMap.range f := ⟨f x, by simp⟩
  set f' : E →ₛₗ[σ] F := ↑f
  change f' ((LinearEquiv.ofInjective f' hinj).symm x') = _
  rw [LinearEquiv.ofInjective_symm_apply (f := f') (h := hinj) x']

-- TODO: once mathlib has Fredholm operators, generalise the next two lemmas accordingly

/-- If `f : E →L[𝕜] F` is injective with closed range (and `E` and `F` are Banach spaces),
`f` is anti-Lipschitz. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Banach/Variant2cd4a937b32eab24d962ff4a09a527d869bb7a3882341d643a1a055992b0d035.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Banach/Variant2cd4a937b32eab24d962ff4a09a527d869bb7a3882341d643a1a055992b0d035.lean#L382).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f41c04154ef103edb42079b4c3e5b7a20aa95615` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
