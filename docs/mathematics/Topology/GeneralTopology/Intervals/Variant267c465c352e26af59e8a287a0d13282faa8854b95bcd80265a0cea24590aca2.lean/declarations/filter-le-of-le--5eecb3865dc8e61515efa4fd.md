## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:05a424f1-05ef-0407-5ee3-293a372c5cf4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 205–213.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem filter_le_of_le {n m l : ℕ} (hnl : n ≤ l) :
    ((Ico n m).filter fun x => l ≤ x) = Ico l m := by
  cases' le_total l m with hlm hml
  · rw [← append_consecutive hnl hlm, filter_append, filter_le_of_top_le (le_refl l),
      filter_le_of_le_bot (le_refl l), nil_append]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Intervals/Variant267c465c352e26af59e8a287a0d13282faa8854b95bcd80265a0cea24590aca2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Intervals/Variant267c465c352e26af59e8a287a0d13282faa8854b95bcd80265a0cea24590aca2.lean#L205).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `086e7a7371c6b8d95160c494610cd7dbabcb4836` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
