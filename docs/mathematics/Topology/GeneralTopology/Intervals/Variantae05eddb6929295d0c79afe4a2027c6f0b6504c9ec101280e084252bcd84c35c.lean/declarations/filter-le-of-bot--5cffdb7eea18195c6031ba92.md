## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:81cbcc67-678b-dfee-8882-28edd7ec3f5c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 219–230.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem filter_le_of_bot {n m : ℕ} (hnm : n < m) : ((Ico n m).filter fun x => x ≤ n) = [n] := by
  rw [← filter_lt_of_succ_bot hnm]
  exact filter_congr' fun _ _ => by
    rw [decide_eq_true_eq, decide_eq_true_eq]
    exact lt_succ_iff.symm
#align list.Ico.filter_le_of_bot List.Ico.filter_le_of_bot

/-- For any natural numbers n, a, and b, one of the following holds:
1. n < a
2. n ≥ b
3. n ∈ Ico a b
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Intervals/Variantae05eddb6929295d0c79afe4a2027c6f0b6504c9ec101280e084252bcd84c35c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Intervals/Variantae05eddb6929295d0c79afe4a2027c6f0b6504c9ec101280e084252bcd84c35c.lean#L219).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `25136a1b3a16066820c7d4aeff034a6cc835f3e8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
