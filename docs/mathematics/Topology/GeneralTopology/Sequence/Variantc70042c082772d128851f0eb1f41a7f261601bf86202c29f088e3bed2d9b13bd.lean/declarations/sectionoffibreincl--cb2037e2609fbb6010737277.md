## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4640a177091a705697ee083c47036f189ff6a9fe265e0680ba4309e2e1a89d24`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 133–147.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
def sectionOfFibreIncl (π : T → S × Option X) (σ : Option X → S → T)
    (hσ' : ∀ (x : Option X) (s : S), (π (σ x s)).2 = x) : S → (Prod.snd ∘ π_r π σ) ⁻¹' {none} :=
  fun s ↦ ⟨⟨σ none s, by grind⟩, by grind⟩

/-- Given a map `π : T → S × OnePoint X`, define a new space `S'` and a map `y : S' ⟶ S` which has
the property that in the Cartesian diagram
```
T' -> S' ⨯ OnePoint X
|         |
v         v
T  -> S  ⨯ OnePoint X
```
there are maps `σ x : S' ⟶ T'` for each `x : OnePoint X` such that
`S' ⨯ OnePoint X ⟶ S' ⟶ T' ⟶ S' ⨯ OnePoint X` is the identity for
all points `⟨s, x⟩ : S' ⨯ OnePoint X`. -/
````

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Sequence/Variantc70042c082772d128851f0eb1f41a7f261601bf86202c29f088e3bed2d9b13bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Sequence/Variantc70042c082772d128851f0eb1f41a7f261601bf86202c29f088e3bed2d9b13bd.lean#L133).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6198ecf4cfe62253135d270015027baac93a152e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
