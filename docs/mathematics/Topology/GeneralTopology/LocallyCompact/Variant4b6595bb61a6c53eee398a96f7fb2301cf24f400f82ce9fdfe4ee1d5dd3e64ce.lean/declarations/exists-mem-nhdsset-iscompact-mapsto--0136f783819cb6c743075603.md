## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:77eebd29-4936-eaa8-55c3-5062611bc276`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 158–171.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma exists_mem_nhdsSet_isCompact_mapsTo [LocallyCompactPair X Y] {f : X → Y} {K : Set X}
    {U : Set Y} (hf : Continuous f) (hK : IsCompact K) (hU : IsOpen U) (hKU : MapsTo f K U) :
    ∃ L ∈ 𝓝ˢ K, IsCompact L ∧ MapsTo f L U := by
  choose! V hxV hVc hVU using fun x (hx : x ∈ K) ↦
    exists_mem_nhds_isCompact_mapsTo hf (hU.mem_nhds (hKU hx))
  rcases hK.elim_nhds_subcover_nhdsSet hxV with ⟨s, hsK, hKs⟩
  exact ⟨_, hKs, s.isCompact_biUnion fun x hx ↦ hVc x (hsK x hx), mapsTo_iUnion₂.2 fun x hx ↦
    hVU x (hsK x hx)⟩

/-- In a locally compact space, for every containment `K ⊆ U` of a compact set `K` in an open
  set `U`, there is a compact neighborhood `L` such that `K ⊆ L ⊆ U`: equivalently, there is a
  compact `L` such that `K ⊆ interior L` and `L ⊆ U`.
  See also `exists_compact_closed_between`, in which one guarantees additionally that `L` is closed
  if the space is regular. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyCompact/Variant4b6595bb61a6c53eee398a96f7fb2301cf24f400f82ce9fdfe4ee1d5dd3e64ce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyCompact/Variant4b6595bb61a6c53eee398a96f7fb2301cf24f400f82ce9fdfe4ee1d5dd3e64ce.lean#L158).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a8daae99ac29b2ad06fbe9308dc7fb988c732763` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
