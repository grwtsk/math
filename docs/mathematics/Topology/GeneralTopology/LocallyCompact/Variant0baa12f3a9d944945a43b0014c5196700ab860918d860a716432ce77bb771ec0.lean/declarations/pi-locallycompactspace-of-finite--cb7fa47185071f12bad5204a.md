## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ca20418b83e9babf69e706519d26a70e8850b59eff0f800265f3e4b4024a9369`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Pi.locallyCompactSpace_of_finite [Finite ι] : LocallyCompactSpace (∀ i, X i) :=
  ⟨fun t n hn => by
    rw [nhds_pi, Filter.mem_pi] at hn
    obtain ⟨s, -, n', hn', hsub⟩ := hn
    choose n'' hn'' hsub' hc using fun i =>
      LocallyCompactSpace.local_compact_nhds (t i) (n' i) (hn' i)
    refine ⟨(Set.univ : Set ι).pi n'', ?_, subset_trans (fun _ h => ?_) hsub, isCompact_univ_pi hc⟩
    · exact (set_pi_mem_nhds_iff (@Set.finite_univ ι _) _).mpr fun i _ => hn'' i
    · exact fun i _ => hsub' i (h i trivial)⟩

/-- For spaces that are not Hausdorff. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyCompact/Variant0baa12f3a9d944945a43b0014c5196700ab860918d860a716432ce77bb771ec0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyCompact/Variant0baa12f3a9d944945a43b0014c5196700ab860918d860a716432ce77bb771ec0.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `798e3dd3aa8b3b0f44bcab08fc4522fe989434aa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
