## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9add2ee9-ec1a-2d3f-b2a0-3ee43573bc2d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_compact_subset [LocallyCompactSpace X] {x : X} {U : Set X} (hU : IsOpen U)
    (hx : x ∈ U) : ∃ K : Set X, IsCompact K ∧ x ∈ interior K ∧ K ⊆ U := by
  rcases LocallyCompactSpace.local_compact_nhds x U (hU.mem_nhds hx) with ⟨K, h1K, h2K, h3K⟩
  exact ⟨K, h3K, mem_interior_iff_mem_nhds.2 h1K, h2K⟩

/-- If `f : X → Y` is a continuous map in a locally compact pair of topological spaces,
`K : set X` is a compact set, and `U` is an open neighbourhood of `f '' K`,
then there exists a compact neighbourhood `L` of `K` such that `f` maps `L` to `U`.

This is a generalization of `exists_mem_nhds_isCompact_mapsTo`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyCompact/Variant774235eb3428803b8907dc2b5ace48d1d53ab359a8e312067e0dbb248e52bf1e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyCompact/Variant774235eb3428803b8907dc2b5ace48d1d53ab359a8e312067e0dbb248e52bf1e.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1061572b70778d491c3e7fe9273945f44c588294` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
