## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a3fae965-099c-bed5-ce17-9ac0d0188056`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 122–136.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem MellinLogDerivativeSquare.differentiableOn_residual
    {q : ℕ} [NeZero q] {χ : DirichletCharacter ℂ q}
    (square : MellinLogDerivativeSquare χ)
    (hBound : CenteredTwistedPsiHalfPlusEpsilon χ) :
    DifferentiableOn ℂ square.residual criticalRightHalfPlane := by
  have hL : DifferentiableOn ℂ (poleRemovedLFunction χ)
      criticalRightHalfPlane :=
    (differentiable_poleRemovedLFunction χ).differentiableOn
  have hL' : DifferentiableOn ℂ (deriv (poleRemovedLFunction χ))
      criticalRightHalfPlane :=
    hL.deriv isOpen_criticalRightHalfPlane
  exact hL'.add
    (((square.mellin_differentiableOn hBound).add
      (by fun_prop)).mul hL)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/MellinLogDerivative/Variant40a61249a7d96c6e3ab397ab38994e83e7d81739c6ae6d3d234091023e6dc3c8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/MellinLogDerivative/Variant40a61249a7d96c6e3ab397ab38994e83e7d81739c6ae6d3d234091023e6dc3c8.lean#L122).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `32c78c1ca5afa5ec2c7d74b24b2396be09a9ab85` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
