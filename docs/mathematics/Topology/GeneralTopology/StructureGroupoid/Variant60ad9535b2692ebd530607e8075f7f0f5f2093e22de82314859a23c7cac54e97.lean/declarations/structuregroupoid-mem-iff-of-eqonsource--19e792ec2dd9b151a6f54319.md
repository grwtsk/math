## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8f7fbb62-07ba-598d-eedf-a3f9de92bc45`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 190–194.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem StructureGroupoid.mem_iff_of_eqOnSource {G : StructureGroupoid H}
    {e e' : OpenPartialHomeomorph H H} (h : e ≈ e') : e ∈ G ↔ e' ∈ G :=
  ⟨fun he ↦ G.mem_of_eqOnSource he (Setoid.symm h), fun he' ↦ G.mem_of_eqOnSource he' h⟩

/-- Partial order on the set of groupoids, given by inclusion of the members of the groupoid. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/StructureGroupoid/Variant60ad9535b2692ebd530607e8075f7f0f5f2093e22de82314859a23c7cac54e97.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/StructureGroupoid/Variant60ad9535b2692ebd530607e8075f7f0f5f2093e22de82314859a23c7cac54e97.lean#L190).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
