## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:de41d7529f3fe139b3d645b21e6aa889b44e93c84d2413489d635ea84b0f14cd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 282–299.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Pregroupoid (H : Type*) [TopologicalSpace H] where
  /-- Property describing membership in this groupoid: the pregroupoid "contains"
  all functions `H → H` having the pregroupoid property on some `s : Set H` -/
  property : (H → H) → Set H → Prop
  /-- The pregroupoid property is stable under composition -/
  comp : ∀ {f g u v}, property f u → property g v →
    IsOpen u → IsOpen v → IsOpen (u ∩ f ⁻¹' v) → property (g ∘ f) (u ∩ f ⁻¹' v)
  /-- Pregroupoids contain the identity map (on `univ`) -/
  id_mem : property id univ
  /-- The pregroupoid property is "local", in the sense that `f` has the pregroupoid property on `u`
  iff its restriction to each open subset of `u` has it -/
  locality :
    ∀ {f u}, IsOpen u → (∀ x ∈ u, ∃ v, IsOpen v ∧ x ∈ v ∧ property f (u ∩ v)) → property f u
  /-- If `f = g` on `u` and `property f u`, then `property g u` -/
  congr : ∀ {f g : H → H} {u}, IsOpen u → (∀ x ∈ u, g x = f x) → property f u → property g u

/-- Construct a groupoid of partial homeos for which the map and its inverse have some property,
from a pregroupoid asserting that this property is stable under composition. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/StructureGroupoid/Variant60ad9535b2692ebd530607e8075f7f0f5f2093e22de82314859a23c7cac54e97.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/StructureGroupoid/Variant60ad9535b2692ebd530607e8075f7f0f5f2093e22de82314859a23c7cac54e97.lean#L282).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aa88b98ac85accab9df7b4be012ac92bd37c4ca7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
