## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3a39ee35-458a-16bc-4a5c-cd930469314e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 424–458.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- A version of the **Arzela-Ascoli theorem**.

Let `X, ι` be topological spaces, `𝔖` a covering of `X` by compact subsets, `α` a uniform space,
and `F : ι → (X → α)`. Assume that:
* `F`, viewed as a function `ι → (X →ᵤ[𝔖] α)`, is a closed embedding (in other words, `ι`
  identifies to a closed subset of `X →ᵤ[𝔖] α` through `F`)
* `F` is equicontinuous on each `K ∈ 𝔖`
* For all `x`, the range of `i ↦ F i x` is contained in some fixed compact subset.

Then `ι` is compact. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Ascoli/Varianta898246e2e9b9ab168cead8e3bae9faa3a9325e0bdd9b77df2cad78954de6ea9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
