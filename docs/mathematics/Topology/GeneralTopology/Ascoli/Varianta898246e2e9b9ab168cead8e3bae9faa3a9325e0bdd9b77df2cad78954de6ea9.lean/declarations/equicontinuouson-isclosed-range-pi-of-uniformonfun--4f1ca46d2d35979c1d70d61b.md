## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c419efa2-f66e-e1ef-85b5-68187234edc0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 380–400.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  exact fun f ⟨u, _, hu⟩ ↦ mem_image_of_mem _ <| H.mem_of_tendsto hu <|
    Eventually.of_forall mem_range_self

/-- Let `X` be a topological space, `𝔖` a covering of `X` by compact subsets, and
`α` a uniform space. An equicontinuous subset of `X → α` is closed in the topology of uniform
convergence on all `K ∈ 𝔖` iff it is closed in the topology of pointwise convergence.

This is a specialization of `EquicontinuousOn.isClosed_range_pi_of_uniformOnFun'` to the case where
`𝔖` covers `X`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Ascoli/Varianta898246e2e9b9ab168cead8e3bae9faa3a9325e0bdd9b77df2cad78954de6ea9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Ascoli/Varianta898246e2e9b9ab168cead8e3bae9faa3a9325e0bdd9b77df2cad78954de6ea9.lean#L380).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3c572a02ab48df44a858d10e229ee913611a5b47` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
