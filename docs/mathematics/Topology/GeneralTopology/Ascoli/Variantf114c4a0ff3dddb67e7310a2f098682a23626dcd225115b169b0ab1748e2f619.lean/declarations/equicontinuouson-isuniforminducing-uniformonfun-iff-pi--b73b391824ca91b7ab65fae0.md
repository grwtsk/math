## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0d79864b-254a-04fe-0871-b13343fea2b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 267–282.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma EquicontinuousOn.isUniformInducing_uniformOnFun_iff_pi' [UniformSpace ι]
    {𝔖 : Set (Set X)} (𝔖_compact : ∀ K ∈ 𝔖, IsCompact K)
    (F_eqcont : ∀ K ∈ 𝔖, EquicontinuousOn F K) :
    IsUniformInducing (UniformOnFun.ofFun 𝔖 ∘ F) ↔
    IsUniformInducing ((⋃₀ 𝔖).domRestrict ∘ F) := by
  rw [isUniformInducing_iff_uniformSpace, isUniformInducing_iff_uniformSpace,
      ← EquicontinuousOn.comap_uniformOnFun_eq 𝔖_compact F_eqcont]
  rfl

/-- Let `X` be a topological space, `𝔖` a covering of `X` by compact subsets, `α` a uniform space,
and `F : ι → (X → α)` a family which is equicontinuous on each `K ∈ 𝔖`. Then, the uniform
structures of uniform convergence on `𝔖` and pointwise convergence induce the same
uniform structure on `ι`.

This is a specialization of `EquicontinuousOn.isUniformInducing_uniformOnFun_iff_pi'` to
the case where `𝔖` covers `X`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Ascoli/Variantf114c4a0ff3dddb67e7310a2f098682a23626dcd225115b169b0ab1748e2f619.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Ascoli/Variantf114c4a0ff3dddb67e7310a2f098682a23626dcd225115b169b0ab1748e2f619.lean#L267).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3d4ac426343fe4ca59e27c59cb5a9cb2df6c83c6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
