## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:191c5e021dbbfd8b5144916a98e834df60d61c3996476407654da01707607df6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 213–220.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def transOpenPartialHomeomorph (e : X ≃ₜ Y) (f' : OpenPartialHomeomorph Y Z) :
    OpenPartialHomeomorph X Z where
  toPartialEquiv := e.toEquiv.transPartialEquiv f'.toPartialEquiv
  open_source := f'.open_source.preimage e.continuous
  open_target := f'.open_target
  continuousOn_toFun := f'.continuousOn.comp e.continuous.continuousOn fun _ => id
  continuousOn_invFun := e.symm.continuous.comp_continuousOn f'.symm.continuousOn

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Composition/Variant174598786d605d06f98f702129d1b7f37decc62a852d155137db4b07b4260e4a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Composition/Variant174598786d605d06f98f702129d1b7f37decc62a852d155137db4b07b4260e4a.lean#L213).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `02df1b0d77d6913ab1a12a4e9685376afb0c8a4a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
