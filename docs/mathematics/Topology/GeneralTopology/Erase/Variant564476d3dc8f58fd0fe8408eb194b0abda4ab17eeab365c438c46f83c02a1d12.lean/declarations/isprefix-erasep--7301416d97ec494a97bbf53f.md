## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b8158775-308d-fc54-4f83-41d0c9dfd424`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 240–248.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem IsPrefix.eraseP (h : l₁ <+: l₂) : l₁.eraseP p <+: l₂.eraseP p := by
  rw [IsPrefix] at h
  obtain ⟨t, rfl⟩ := h
  rw [eraseP_append]
  split
  · exact prefix_append (eraseP p l₁) t
  · rw [eraseP_of_forall_not (by simp_all)]
    exact prefix_append l₁ (eraseP p t)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Erase/Variant564476d3dc8f58fd0fe8408eb194b0abda4ab17eeab365c438c46f83c02a1d12.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Erase/Variant564476d3dc8f58fd0fe8408eb194b0abda4ab17eeab365c438c46f83c02a1d12.lean#L240).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `58091872e798159d837f63e09d08455b2f3348c7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
