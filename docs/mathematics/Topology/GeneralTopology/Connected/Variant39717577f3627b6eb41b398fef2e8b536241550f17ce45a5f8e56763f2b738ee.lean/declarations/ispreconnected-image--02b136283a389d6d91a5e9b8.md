## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bb19fa88-03fe-f1bf-c0dd-c5c2e094d923`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 322–343.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem IsPreconnected.image [TopologicalSpace β] {s : Set α} (H : IsPreconnected s)
    (f : α → β) (hf : ContinuousOn f s) : IsPreconnected (f '' s) := by
  -- Unfold/destruct definitions in hypotheses
  rintro u v hu hv huv ⟨_, ⟨x, xs, rfl⟩, xu⟩ ⟨_, ⟨y, ys, rfl⟩, yv⟩
  rcases continuousOn_iff'.1 hf u hu with ⟨u', hu', u'_eq⟩
  rcases continuousOn_iff'.1 hf v hv with ⟨v', hv', v'_eq⟩
  -- Reformulate `huv : f '' s ⊆ u ∪ v` in terms of `u'` and `v'`
  replace huv : s ⊆ u' ∪ v'

    replace huv := subset_inter huv Subset.rfl

    exact (subset_inter_iff.1 huv).1

/-- The image of a connected set is connected as well. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Connected/Variant39717577f3627b6eb41b398fef2e8b536241550f17ce45a5f8e56763f2b738ee.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Connected/Variant39717577f3627b6eb41b398fef2e8b536241550f17ce45a5f8e56763f2b738ee.lean#L322).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b8acb47e4588e836c15e517cee37cb8a60018219` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
