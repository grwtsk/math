## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cae4a016-adb9-e082-33d5-0a4069b63216`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 99–107.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Preperfect.open_inter {U : Set α} (hC : Preperfect C) (hU : IsOpen U) :
    Preperfect (U ∩ C) := by
  rintro x ⟨xU, xC⟩
  apply (hC _ xC).nhds_inter
  exact hU.mem_nhds xU
#align preperfect.open_inter Preperfect.open_inter

/-- The closure of a preperfect set is perfect.
For a converse, see `preperfect_iff_perfect_closure`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Perfect/Variant7ef23810ec88084f968f0d2116e0181ed8d86dc788e98fd5bfd2aacde91e7b4d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Perfect/Variant7ef23810ec88084f968f0d2116e0181ed8d86dc788e98fd5bfd2aacde91e7b4d.lean#L99).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f1351ebd74f06d465d1f865aaa588a6f47ae4bd2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
