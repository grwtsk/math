## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:027dc974-154a-9ab6-cd40-75aff6aa14e5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 37–44.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Submonoid.isOpen_units {M : Type*} [TopologicalSpace M] [Monoid M]
    {U : Submonoid M} (hU : IsOpen (U : Set M)) : IsOpen (U.units : Set Mˣ) :=
  (hU.preimage Units.continuous_val).inter (hU.preimage Units.continuous_coe_inv)

/-- The isomorphism of topological groups between the units of a product and
the product of the units. -/
@[to_additive /-- The isomorphism of topological additive groups between the additive units of a
product and the product of the additive units. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Units/Variantc65499133ab728471d5b9ef7d63e8ea4e2aaa8008ca6e098184e3f551e10c2e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Units/Variantc65499133ab728471d5b9ef7d63e8ea4e2aaa8008ca6e098184e3f551e10c2e7.lean#L37).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `242633a2b01600c8d531baef0f4e1a191297e81e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
