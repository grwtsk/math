## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:76f5a5a5a75a7615a1e4db4c2bb7f63e174a1ca7569515498d60fe64e66a4469`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 37–53.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ContinuousMulEquiv.piUnits {ι : Type*}
    {M : ι → Type*} [(i : ι) → Monoid (M i)] [(i : ι) → TopologicalSpace (M i)] :
    (Π i, M i)ˣ ≃ₜ* Π i, (M i)ˣ where
  __ := MulEquiv.piUnits
  continuous_toFun := continuous_pi fun _ ↦ Units.continuous_iff.mpr
    ⟨continuous_apply _ |>.comp Units.continuous_val,
      continuous_apply _ |>.comp Units.continuous_coe_inv⟩
  continuous_invFun := Units.continuous_iff.mpr
    ⟨continuous_pi fun _ ↦ Units.continuous_val.comp <| continuous_apply _,
      continuous_pi fun _ ↦ Units.continuous_coe_inv.comp <| continuous_apply _⟩

namespace Units

variable {M N : Type*} [TopologicalSpace M] [TopologicalSpace N] [Monoid M] [Monoid N]

/-- Any `ContinuousMulEquiv` induces a `ContinuousMulEquiv` on units. -/
@[simps! apply]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Units/Variantfbd26b700d3dd6a530af859d8345056d8ecdc08891b15a635184f1f8b4b8647e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Units/Variantfbd26b700d3dd6a530af859d8345056d8ecdc08891b15a635184f1f8b4b8647e.lean#L37).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `53f18f912db98510cdac71c94bc5ee125281111f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
