## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1d75d729-3d38-053e-390d-51a38832e3ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 128–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem inverse_one_sub_nth_order (n : ℕ) :
    ∀ᶠ t in 𝓝 0, inverse ((1 : R) - t) = (∑ i ∈ range n, t ^ i) + t ^ n * inverse (1 - t) :=
  Metric.eventually_nhds_iff.2 ⟨1, one_pos, fun t ht ↦ inverse_one_sub_nth_order' n <| by
    rwa [← dist_zero_right]⟩


/-- The formula
`Ring.inverse (x + t) =
  (∑ i ∈ Finset.range n, (- x⁻¹ * t) ^ i) * x⁻¹ + (- x⁻¹ * t) ^ n * Ring.inverse (x + t)`
holds for `t` sufficiently small. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Units/Variant1b3a88f788b8300f63f5fa9939d76df8a3e4f99355590493b59d079015fb735d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Units/Variant1b3a88f788b8300f63f5fa9939d76df8a3e4f99355590493b59d079015fb735d.lean#L128).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1e78b3797df707a3021c48542db40ab62085bbaa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
