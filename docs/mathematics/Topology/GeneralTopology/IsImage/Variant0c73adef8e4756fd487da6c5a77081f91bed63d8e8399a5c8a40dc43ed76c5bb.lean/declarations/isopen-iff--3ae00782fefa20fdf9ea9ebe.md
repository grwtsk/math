## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f610af38-75b7-70ec-8b7b-70100868e379`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 177–182.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isOpen_iff (h : e.IsImage s t) : IsOpen (e.source ∩ s) ↔ IsOpen (e.target ∩ t) :=
  ⟨fun hs => h.symm_preimage_eq' ▸ e.symm.isOpen_inter_preimage hs, fun hs =>
    h.preimage_eq' ▸ e.isOpen_inter_preimage hs⟩

/-- Restrict an `OpenPartialHomeomorph` to a pair of corresponding open sets. -/
@[simps! -fullyApplied apply symm_apply toPartialHomeomorph]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/IsImage/Variant0c73adef8e4756fd487da6c5a77081f91bed63d8e8399a5c8a40dc43ed76c5bb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/IsImage/Variant0c73adef8e4756fd487da6c5a77081f91bed63d8e8399a5c8a40dc43ed76c5bb.lean#L177).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9d2319cc374ce94c6480c63007b04e4c97fd6e22` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
