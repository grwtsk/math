## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:56f18ff1-142d-5f35-b80e-d91f828685b0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 285–295.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem SeqCompactSpace.tendsto_subseq [SeqCompactSpace X] (x : ℕ → X) :
    ∃ (a : X) (φ : ℕ → ℕ), StrictMono φ ∧ Tendsto (x ∘ φ) atTop (𝓝 a) :=
  let ⟨a, _, φ, mono, h⟩ := isSeqCompact_univ fun n => mem_univ (x n)
  ⟨a, φ, mono, h⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Sequences/Variant583a89aeb0e2058524c77137a839d902f2d7a8c3f921bd0c50c86d8bd296b1f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Sequences/Variant583a89aeb0e2058524c77137a839d902f2d7a8c3f921bd0c50c86d8bd296b1f2.lean#L285).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ae9139a6671e75e5e8d2f7fa20c66b31e9a6e1e5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
