## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bd18e13ff3da9e737a76487ddad9b37b554f8fa4051ed3397b2ce8d3a0e81291`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 259–265.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IsSeqCompact (s : Set X) :=
  ∀ ⦃x : ℕ → X⦄, (∀ n, x n ∈ s) → ∃ a ∈ s, ∃ φ : ℕ → ℕ, StrictMono φ ∧ Tendsto (x ∘ φ) atTop (𝓝 a)
#align is_seq_compact IsSeqCompact

/-- A space `X` is sequentially compact if every sequence in `X` has a
converging subsequence. -/
@[mk_iff seqCompactSpace_iff]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Sequences/Variant7dbbdee4930e0e340690fb19d6fe73fa5c65a4bfd2ebe89ee1839614bbb123f3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Sequences/Variant7dbbdee4930e0e340690fb19d6fe73fa5c65a4bfd2ebe89ee1839614bbb123f3.lean#L259).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1b3ec6186dde3020e737d12e81b5d5e1fc6e4f6e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
