## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:21e0e74e-a236-95a3-3985-acddc00199c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 57–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem continuousOn_extendFrom [RegularSpace Y] {f : X → Y} {A B : Set X} (hB : B ⊆ closure A)
    (hf : ∀ x ∈ B, ∃ y, Tendsto f (𝓝[A] x) (𝓝 y)) : ContinuousOn (extendFrom A f) B := by
  set φ := extendFrom A f
  intro x x_in
  suffices ∀ V' ∈ 𝓝 (φ x), IsClosed V' → φ ⁻¹' V' ∈ 𝓝[B] x by
    simpa [ContinuousWithinAt, (closed_nhds_basis (φ x)).tendsto_right_iff]
  intro V' V'_in V'_closed
  obtain ⟨V, V_in, V_op, hV⟩ : ∃ V ∈ 𝓝 x, IsOpen V ∧ V ∩ A ⊆ f ⁻¹' V' := by
    have := tendsto_extendFrom (hf x x_in)
    rcases (nhdsWithin_basis_open x A).tendsto_left_iff.mp this V' V'_in with ⟨V, ⟨hxV, V_op⟩, hV⟩
    exact ⟨V, IsOpen.mem_nhds V_op hxV, V_op, hV⟩
  suffices ∀ y ∈ V ∩ B, φ y ∈ V' from
    mem_of_superset (inter_mem_inf V_in <| mem_principal_self B) this
  rintro y ⟨hyV, hyB⟩
  haveI := mem_closure_iff_nhdsWithin_neBot.mp (hB hyB)
  have limy : Tendsto f (𝓝[A] y) (𝓝 <| φ y) := tendsto_extendFrom (hf y hyB)
  have hVy : V ∈ 𝓝 y := IsOpen.mem_nhds V_op hyV
  have : V ∩ A ∈ 𝓝[A] y := by simpa only [inter_comm] using inter_mem_nhdsWithin A hVy
  exact V'_closed.mem_of_tendsto limy (mem_of_superset this hV)

/-- If a function `f` to a T₃ space `Y` has a limit within a
dense set `A` for any `x`, then `extendFrom A f` is continuous. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ExtendFrom/Variante61c7d8dc9440ad428c1daa9f5ef62e21eb28131f20dbc3390d91bb05bc52c5e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ExtendFrom/Variante61c7d8dc9440ad428c1daa9f5ef62e21eb28131f20dbc3390d91bb05bc52c5e.lean#L57).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `649538b26ec696ad9652b844ae04e2464c8e08a7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
