## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7e8fb84e-eb3e-bad8-2a57-742fce7745a0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 981–989.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem induced_to_pi {X : Type*} (f : X → ∀ i, π i) :
    induced f Pi.topologicalSpace = ⨅ i, induced (f · i) inferInstance := by
  simp_rw [Pi.topologicalSpace, induced_iInf, induced_compose, Function.comp_def]

/-- Suppose `π i` is a family of topological spaces indexed by `i : ι`, and `X` is a type
endowed with a family of maps `f i : X → π i` for every `i : ι`, hence inducing a
map `g : X → Π i, π i`. This lemma shows that infimum of the topologies on `X` induced by
the `f i` as `i : ι` varies is simply the topology on `X` induced by `g : X → Π i, π i`
where `Π i, π i` is endowed with the usual product topology. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Constructions/Variant044b99c15eba5ccb813a4e76bb3c97591a476068f16d274bd1575a6643403783.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Constructions/Variant044b99c15eba5ccb813a4e76bb3c97591a476068f16d274bd1575a6643403783.lean#L981).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ad260d583f2d60ca9a6d9b358f550a8ebd6d220b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
