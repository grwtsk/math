## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:91897584-025d-c4e3-84df-3b462642880f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 177–183.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Prod.left_inv {x : TotalSpace (F₁ × F₂) (E₁ ×ᵇ E₂)}
    (h : x ∈ π (F₁ × F₂) (E₁ ×ᵇ E₂) ⁻¹' (e₁.baseSet ∩ e₂.baseSet)) :
    Prod.invFun' e₁ e₂ (Prod.toFun' e₁ e₂ x) = x := by
  obtain ⟨x, v₁, v₂⟩ := x
  obtain ⟨h₁ : x ∈ e₁.baseSet, h₂ : x ∈ e₂.baseSet⟩ := h
  simp [Prod.toFun', Prod.invFun', h₁, h₂]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Constructions/Variante72455c90aca05549cde6379792384449f300776ffb4d5ac58c63e8357514b81.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Constructions/Variante72455c90aca05549cde6379792384449f300776ffb4d5ac58c63e8357514b81.lean#L177).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cf98b0997bc58e558cb34efbdc86ba74024a7c5f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
