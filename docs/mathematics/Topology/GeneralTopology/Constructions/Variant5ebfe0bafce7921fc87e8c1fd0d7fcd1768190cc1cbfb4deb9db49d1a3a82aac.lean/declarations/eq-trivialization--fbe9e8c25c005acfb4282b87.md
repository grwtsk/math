## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2e9a63b4-c893-1b6f-f76e-cad268893348`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 86–106.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_trivialization (e : Trivialization F (π F (Bundle.Trivial B F)))
    [i : MemTrivializationAtlas e] : e = trivialization B F := i.out

end Trivial

end Bundle

/-! ### Fibrewise product of two bundles -/


section Prod

variable {B : Type*}

section Defs

variable (F₁ : Type*) (E₁ : B → Type*) (F₂ : Type*) (E₂ : B → Type*)
variable [TopologicalSpace (TotalSpace F₁ E₁)] [TopologicalSpace (TotalSpace F₂ E₂)]

/-- Equip the total space of the fiberwise product of two fiber bundles `E₁`, `E₂` with
the induced topology from the diagonal embedding into `TotalSpace F₁ E₁ × TotalSpace F₂ E₂`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Constructions/Variant5ebfe0bafce7921fc87e8c1fd0d7fcd1768190cc1cbfb4deb9db49d1a3a82aac.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Constructions/Variant5ebfe0bafce7921fc87e8c1fd0d7fcd1768190cc1cbfb4deb9db49d1a3a82aac.lean#L86).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bcd731b39e401c04dd74cdfb6242d11ae2852a0a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
