## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:49ea02c9-8dbd-70bd-14e3-d1d8caad4a71`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 745–763.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isOpen_prod_iff' {s : Set α} {t : Set β} :
    IsOpen (s ×ˢ t) ↔ IsOpen s ∧ IsOpen t ∨ s = ∅ ∨ t = ∅ := by
  cases' (s ×ˢ t).eq_empty_or_nonempty with h h
  · simp [h, prod_eq_empty_iff.1 h]
  · have st : s.Nonempty ∧ t.Nonempty := prod_nonempty_iff.1 h
    constructor
    · intro (H : IsOpen (s ×ˢ t))

      show IsOpen s
      · rw [← fst_image_prod s st.2]
        exact isOpenMap_fst _ H
      show IsOpen t
      · rw [← snd_image_prod st.1 t]
        exact isOpenMap_snd _ H
    · intro H
      simp only [st.1.ne_empty, st.2.ne_empty, not_false_iff, or_false_iff] at H
      exact H.1.prod H.2
#align is_open_prod_iff' isOpen_prod_iff'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Constructions/Variant5cd1966caafc0000f476fd308ac5ba7cf48a3c36629b5e8a4f6a73f7b8db23c9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Constructions/Variant5cd1966caafc0000f476fd308ac5ba7cf48a3c36629b5e8a4f6a73f7b8db23c9.lean#L745).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a9c192d25453c8a13928c86bc3a19c4c17859579` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
