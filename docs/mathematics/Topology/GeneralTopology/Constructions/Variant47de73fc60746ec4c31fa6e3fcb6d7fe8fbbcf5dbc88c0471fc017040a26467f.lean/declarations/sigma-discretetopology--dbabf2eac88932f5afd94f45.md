## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a8f8241765a0678b147f0820d0f5cd453c2d9eca311834f2852ce9d43537ad89`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 207–210.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Sigma.discreteTopology {ι : Type*} {Y : ι → Type v} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (Y i)]
    [h : ∀ i, DiscreteTopology (Y i)] : DiscreteTopology (Sigma Y) :=
  ⟨iSup_eq_bot.2 fun _ => by simp only [(h _).eq_bot, coinduced_bot]⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Constructions/Variant47de73fc60746ec4c31fa6e3fcb6d7fe8fbbcf5dbc88c0471fc017040a26467f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Constructions/Variant47de73fc60746ec4c31fa6e3fcb6d7fe8fbbcf5dbc88c0471fc017040a26467f.lean#L207).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `91a7136cc7b39e609f8becbf9e0785069bb2610d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
