## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f288dae5-8f7a-39e7-ba26-89f6f5203138`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 92–100.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exp_square_rescale (x u v : ℝ) :
    Real.exp (-2*x)*(Real.exp x*u-Real.exp (-x)*v)^2 =
      (u-Real.exp (-2*x)*v)^2 := by
  have he : Real.exp (-2*x) = Real.exp (-x)^2 := by
    rw [sq,← Real.exp_add]; congr 1; ring
  have hp : Real.exp (-x)*Real.exp x=1 := by rw [← Real.exp_add,neg_add_cancel,Real.exp_zero]
  rw [he,← mul_pow, mul_sub, ← mul_assoc, hp,one_mul]
  congr 2; ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Attempt06/Variant6d7644ab5b89ec7607e22db1567faa453a9551fc228cf8c2a77a452293add192.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Attempt06/Variant6d7644ab5b89ec7607e22db1567faa453a9551fc228cf8c2a77a452293add192.lean#L92).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e2bd980f3bb785e525ca6d82ceef96253bccd9ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
