## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1a98fbf0787e62f31e1acf803c6b3dfef56c8ef5324ac777d2fdbd8e9ad41f5d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 354–362.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instContinuousConstSMul (M : Type*)
    [Monoid M] [DistribMulAction M F] [SMulCommClass 𝕜₂ M F]
    [TopologicalSpace F] [IsTopologicalAddGroup F] [ContinuousConstSMul M F] (𝔖 : Set (Set E)) :
    ContinuousConstSMul M (E →SLᵤ[σ, 𝔖] F) :=
  let _ := IsTopologicalAddGroup.rightUniformSpace F
  have _ : IsUniformAddGroup F := isUniformAddGroup_of_addCommGroup
  have _ := uniformContinuousConstSMul_of_continuousConstSMul M F
  inferInstance

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformConvergenceCLM/Variant0dd024f67da3fb817d72a2515b5e2c3e0f499525b66c139a0a6519a3f62fcbed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/UniformConvergenceCLM/Variant0dd024f67da3fb817d72a2515b5e2c3e0f499525b66c139a0a6519a3f62fcbed.lean#L354).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2895b3845de48cd019222a498552f7c119aeefe2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
