## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:99497e82573e33c61a110e075981c523918be4926d8933fdad93688ca809dcee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 355–362.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Pi.locallyPathConnectedSpace {Z : ι → Type*} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (Z i)]
    [∀ i, LocallyPathConnectedSpace (Z i)] [∀ i, PathConnectedSpace (Z i)] :
    LocallyPathConnectedSpace (∀ i, Z i) :=
  locallyPathConnectedSpace_of_finite_not_pathConnectedSpace
    (finite_empty.subset fun _ hi ↦ hi inferInstance)

/-- A product of spaces is locally path-connected iff it is empty, or every factor is locally
path-connected and all but finitely many factors are path-connected. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyPathConnected/Variantdd55e708bf89e40f8eb6999505e40fd7aeee3df1ca05de5a4f12e6c125015dee.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocallyPathConnected/Variantdd55e708bf89e40f8eb6999505e40fd7aeee3df1ca05de5a4f12e6c125015dee.lean#L355).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `529d2b347e5e986184d9f08eb1ee17f4994a220e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
