## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f848f048-fd26-f5da-330f-997f8cababe0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 444–455.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma linearGrowthInf_comp_nonneg (h : Monotone u) (h' : u ≠ ⊥) (hv : Tendsto v atTop atTop) :
    0 ≤ linearGrowthInf (u ∘ v) := by
  simp only [ne_eq, funext_iff, Pi.zero_apply, not_forall] at h'
  obtain ⟨m, hum⟩ := h'
  have um_uvn : ∀ᶠ n in atTop, u m ≤ (u ∘ v) n := by
    apply (eventually_map (P := fun n : ℕ ↦ u m ≤ u n)).2
    exact (eventually_atTop.2 ⟨m, fun n m_n ↦ h m_n⟩).filter_mono hv
  apply (linearGrowthInf_eventually_monotone um_uvn).trans'
  rcases eq_or_ne (u m) ⊤ with hum' | hum'
  · rw [hum', ← Pi.top_def, linearGrowthInf_top]; exact le_top
  · rw [linearGrowthInf_const hum hum']

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LinearGrowth/Variantbb6eb43dc56feb32dce1a0c6ea56bb18cec8c6ec4d3d2a123fdb0210d1925a67.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LinearGrowth/Variantbb6eb43dc56feb32dce1a0c6ea56bb18cec8c6ec4d3d2a123fdb0210d1925a67.lean#L444).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b774387bd86b480da7def0ce1e8f3857fbbdf837` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
