## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8adfb762-3309-3f8d-45b8-1e49739b1bf3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 109–122.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem omegaLimit_preimage_subset {α' : Type*} (ϕ : τ → α' → β) (s : Set α') (f : Filter τ)
    (g : α → α') : ω f (fun t x ↦ ϕ t (g x)) (g ⁻¹' s) ⊆ ω f ϕ s :=
  mapsTo_omegaLimit _ (mapsTo_preimage _ _) (fun _t _x ↦ rfl) continuous_id

/-!
### Equivalent definitions of the omega limit

The next few lemmas are various versions of the property
characterising ω-limits:
-/

/-- An element `y` is in the ω-limit set of `s` w.r.t. `f` if the
    preimages of an arbitrary neighbourhood of `y` frequently
    (w.r.t. `f`) intersects of `s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/OmegaLimit/Variant5b42b70140c31605496a70d528fb778deba7e93dba6a71ab29cca69c469d13d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/OmegaLimit/Variant5b42b70140c31605496a70d528fb778deba7e93dba6a71ab29cca69c469d13d7.lean#L109).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `766da83250174660c01cd61b9456d5b65aa6db8a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
