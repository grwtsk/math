## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c6a40cc3-3c7c-8507-b815-5d7cc077019e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 189–200.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem omegaLimit_iUnion (p : ι → Set α) : ⋃ i, ω f ϕ (p i) ⊆ ω f ϕ (⋃ i, p i) := by
  rw [iUnion_subset_iff]
  exact fun i ↦ omegaLimit_mono_right _ _ (subset_iUnion _ _)
#align omega_limit_Union omegaLimit_iUnion

/-!
Different expressions for omega limits, useful for rewrites. In
particular, one may restrict the intersection to sets in `f` which are
subsets of some set `v` also in `f`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/OmegaLimit/Variant6ac372e2812b9d9286b2d4d05963cef4c4e80871a14c6ec471bcd16e7b5d166d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/OmegaLimit/Variant6ac372e2812b9d9286b2d4d05963cef4c4e80871a14c6ec471bcd16e7b5d166d.lean#L189).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cab206f722db59a1d6fdee404ce3b4d80e6eec0e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
