## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2333e4c7-2f84-0a15-e2c9-f9a787119c73`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–59.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma exists_finite_clopen_cover (hU : IsOpenCover U) : ∃ (n : ℕ) (V : Fin n → Clopens X),
    (∀ j, ∃ i, (V j : Set X) ⊆ U i) ∧ univ ⊆ ⋃ j, (V j : Set X) := by
  -- Choose an index `r x` for each point in `X` such that `∀ x, x ∈ U (r x)`.
  choose r hr using hU.exists_mem
  -- Choose a clopen neighbourhood `V x` of each `x` contained in `U (r x)`.
  choose V hV hVx hVU using fun x ↦ compact_exists_isClopen_in_isOpen (U _).isOpen (hr x)
  -- Apply compactness to extract a finite subset of the `V`s which covers `X`.
  obtain ⟨t, ht⟩ : ∃ t, univ ⊆ ⋃ i ∈ t, V i :=
    isCompact_univ.elim_finite_subcover V (fun x ↦ (hV x).2) (fun x _ ↦ mem_iUnion.mpr ⟨x, hVx x⟩)
  -- Biject it noncanonically with `Fin n` for some `n`.
  refine ⟨_, fun j ↦ ⟨_, hV (t.equivFin.symm j)⟩, fun j ↦ ⟨_, hVU _⟩, fun x hx ↦ ?_⟩
  obtain ⟨m, hm, hm'⟩ := mem_iUnion₂.mp (ht hx)
  exact Set.mem_iUnion_of_mem (t.equivFin ⟨m, hm⟩) (by simpa)

/-- Any open cover of a profinite space can be refined to a finite cover by pairwise disjoint
nonempty clopens. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/DisjointCover/Variant56c8fd244790376b845b89a393aa158bcfcce54fbc61fadcf48479c56b30a082.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/DisjointCover/Variant56c8fd244790376b845b89a393aa158bcfcce54fbc61fadcf48479c56b30a082.lean#L44).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a0249b1f29e80cd35378db4149d89b86606dac3a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
