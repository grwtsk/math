## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bb6b0812-ccc1-5841-63d8-e0482d55229e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 451–468.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

      (fun m ↦ TotalSpace.mk' (F₁ →L[𝕜] F₂) (E := fun (x : B) ↦ (E₁ x →L[𝕜] E₂ x)) (b m) (ϕ m)))
    (hv : Continuous (fun m ↦ TotalSpace.mk' F₁ (b m) (v m))) :

/-- Consider `C^n` maps `v : M → E₁` and `v : M → E₂` to vector bundles, over a basemap
`b : M → B`, and bilinear maps `ψ m : E₁ (b m) → E₂ (b m) → E₃ (b m)` depending smoothly on `m`.
One can apply `ψ  m` to `v m` and `w m`, and the resulting map is `C^n`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hom/Variant5d29cc14b53bcbc5511c23a72d441b97a2325fddb40c74d031006749ede2ee9f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hom/Variant5d29cc14b53bcbc5511c23a72d441b97a2325fddb40c74d031006749ede2ee9f.lean#L451).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3bcd60575268952101c9876171e5116af0dc10e3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
