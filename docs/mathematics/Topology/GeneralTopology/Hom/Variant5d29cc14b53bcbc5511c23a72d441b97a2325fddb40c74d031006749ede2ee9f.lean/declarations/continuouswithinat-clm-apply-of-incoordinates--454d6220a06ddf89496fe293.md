## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:68acab55-9033-75c8-acf0-920a4be4718d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 338–374.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Consider a continuous map `v : M → E₁` to a vector bundle, over a base map `b₁ : M → B₁`, and
another basemap `b₂ : M → B₂`. Given linear maps `ϕ m : E₁ (b₁ m) → E₂ (b₂ m)` depending
continuously on `m`, one can apply `ϕ m` to `g m`, and the resulting map is continuous.

Note that the continuity of `ϕ` cannot be always be stated as continuity of a map into a bundle,
as the pullback bundles `b₁ *ᵖ E₁` and `b₂ *ᵖ E₂` only have a nice topology when `b₁` and `b₂` are
globally continuous, but we want to apply this lemma with only local information. Therefore, we
formulate it using continuity of `ϕ` read in coordinates.

Version for `ContinuousAt`. We also give a version for `ContinuousWithinAt`, but no version for
`ContinuousOn` or `Continuous` as our assumption, written in coordinates, only makes sense around
a point.

For a version with `B₁ = B₂` and `b₁ = b₂`, in which continuity can be expressed without
`inCoordinates`, see `ContinuousWithinAt.clm_bundle_apply`

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hom/Variant5d29cc14b53bcbc5511c23a72d441b97a2325fddb40c74d031006749ede2ee9f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Hom/Variant5d29cc14b53bcbc5511c23a72d441b97a2325fddb40c74d031006749ede2ee9f.lean#L338).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
