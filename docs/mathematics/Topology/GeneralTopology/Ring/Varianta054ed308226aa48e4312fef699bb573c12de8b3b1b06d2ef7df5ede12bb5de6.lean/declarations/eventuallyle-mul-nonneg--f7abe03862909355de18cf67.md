## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b29747ac-6b30-19d5-50b4-030ef500dd0e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 43–46.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem EventuallyLE.mul_nonneg [Semiring β] [PartialOrder β] [IsOrderedRing β]
    {l : Filter α} {f g : α → β} (hf : 0 ≤ᶠ[l] f)
    (hg : 0 ≤ᶠ[l] g) : 0 ≤ᶠ[l] f * g := by filter_upwards [hf, hg] with x using _root_.mul_nonneg

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Ring/Varianta054ed308226aa48e4312fef699bb573c12de8b3b1b06d2ef7df5ede12bb5de6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Ring/Varianta054ed308226aa48e4312fef699bb573c12de8b3b1b06d2ef7df5ede12bb5de6.lean#L43).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6712897a6836ac76890490fc4815a9fe144afef9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
