## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4730b8d8-ab16-721e-9340-6a969827274f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–128.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isClosed_image_coe_of_bounded_of_weak_closed {s : Set (E' →SL[σ₁₂] F)} (hb : IsBounded s)
    (hc : ∀ f : E' →SL[σ₁₂] F,
      (⇑f : E' → F) ∈ closure (((↑) : (E' →SL[σ₁₂] F) → E' → F) '' s) → f ∈ s) :
    IsClosed (((↑) : (E' →SL[σ₁₂] F) → E' → F) '' s) :=
  isClosed_of_closure_subset fun f hf =>
    ⟨ofMemClosureImageCoeBounded f hb hf, hc (ofMemClosureImageCoeBounded f hb hf) hf, rfl⟩

/-- If a set `s` of semilinear functions is bounded and is closed in the weak-* topology, then its
image under coercion to functions `E → F` is a compact set. We don't have a name for `E →SL[σ] F`
with weak-* topology in `mathlib`, so we use an equivalent condition (see `isClosed_induced_iff'`).

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Completeness/Variant09c9b95c615c109bf67642fa664963562c31bcac07c32c7bef7842ef67995b5a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Completeness/Variant09c9b95c615c109bf67642fa664963562c31bcac07c32c7bef7842ef67995b5a.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ce89b94bc69ef6160c4384f1fd7e906d5be86167` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
