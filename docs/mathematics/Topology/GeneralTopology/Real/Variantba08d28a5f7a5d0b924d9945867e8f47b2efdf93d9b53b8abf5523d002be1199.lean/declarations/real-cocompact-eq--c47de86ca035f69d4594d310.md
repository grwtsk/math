## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b3bf0029-e40b-6908-d00b-7d552ed51750`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–98.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Real.cocompact_eq : cocompact ℝ = atBot ⊔ atTop := by
  simp only [← comap_dist_right_atTop_eq_cocompact (0 : ℝ), Real.dist_eq, sub_zero,
    comap_abs_atTop]
#align real.cocompact_eq Real.cocompact_eq

/- TODO(Mario): Prove that these are uniform isomorphisms instead of uniform embeddings
lemma uniform_embedding_add_rat {r : ℚ} : uniform_embedding (fun p : ℚ => p + r) :=
_

lemma uniform_embedding_mul_rat {q : ℚ} (hq : q ≠ 0) : uniform_embedding ((*) q) :=
_ -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Real/Variantba08d28a5f7a5d0b924d9945867e8f47b2efdf93d9b53b8abf5523d002be1199.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Real/Variantba08d28a5f7a5d0b924d9945867e8f47b2efdf93d9b53b8abf5523d002be1199.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ff9496f4b89d76855514bfe5199526105c6d8e76` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
