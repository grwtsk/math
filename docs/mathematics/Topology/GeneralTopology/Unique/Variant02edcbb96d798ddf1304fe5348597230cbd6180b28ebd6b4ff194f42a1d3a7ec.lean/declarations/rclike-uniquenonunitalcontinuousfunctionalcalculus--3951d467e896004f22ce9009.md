## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:353e48238efc31f2c22e8086990ca17cf49d66afdc22466ba01328b8b1c2ab37`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 224–245.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance RCLike.uniqueNonUnitalContinuousFunctionalCalculus

    [IsScalarTower 𝕜 A A] [SMulCommClass 𝕜 A A] :

end RCLike

open NNReal

variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [Zero X]

namespace ContinuousMapZero

/-- This map sends `f : C(X, ℝ)` to `Real.toNNReal ∘ f`, bundled as a continuous map `C(X, ℝ≥0)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Unique/Variant02edcbb96d798ddf1304fe5348597230cbd6180b28ebd6b4ff194f42a1d3a7ec.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Unique/Variant02edcbb96d798ddf1304fe5348597230cbd6180b28ebd6b4ff194f42a1d3a7ec.lean#L224).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7b38f1476f3121f8b92478b4bb206ba7f2640c61` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
