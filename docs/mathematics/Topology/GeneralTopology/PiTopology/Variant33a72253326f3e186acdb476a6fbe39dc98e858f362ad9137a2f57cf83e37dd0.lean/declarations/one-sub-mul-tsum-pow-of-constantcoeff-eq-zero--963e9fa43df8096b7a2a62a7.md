## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e9486700-4dee-b182-ef8b-fa48ac577ee8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 321–334.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem one_sub_mul_tsum_pow_of_constantCoeff_eq_zero (h : f.constantCoeff = 0) :
    (1 - f) * ∑' (i : ℕ), f ^ i = 1 :=
  (summable_pow_of_constantCoeff_eq_zero h).one_sub_mul_tsum_pow

end GeomSeries

end Sum

section Prod
variable {σ R : Type*} [TopologicalSpace R] [CommSemiring R]
variable {ι : Type*} {f : ι → MvPowerSeries σ R} [LinearOrder ι] [LocallyFiniteOrderBot ι]

/-- If the weighted order of a family of `MvPowerSeries` tends to infinity, the collection of all
possible products over `Finset` is summable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/PiTopology/Variant33a72253326f3e186acdb476a6fbe39dc98e858f362ad9137a2f57cf83e37dd0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PiTopology/Variant33a72253326f3e186acdb476a6fbe39dc98e858f362ad9137a2f57cf83e37dd0.lean#L321).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e10665a9dabadce1ab7a666247539b1e7d36c827` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
