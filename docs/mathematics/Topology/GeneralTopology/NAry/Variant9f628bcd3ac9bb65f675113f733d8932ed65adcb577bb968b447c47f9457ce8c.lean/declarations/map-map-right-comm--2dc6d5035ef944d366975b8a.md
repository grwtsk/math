## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ac57444c-9e8c-1d4c-e611-fe46a2ccb649`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 220–224.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_map₂_right_comm {m : α → β' → γ} {n : β → β'} {m' : α → β → δ} {n' : δ → γ}
    (h_right_comm : ∀ a b, m a (n b) = n' (m' a b)) : map₂ m f (g.map n) = (map₂ m' f g).map n' :=
  (map_map₂_distrib_right fun a b => (h_right_comm a b).symm).symm

/-- The other direction does not hold because of the `f-f` cross terms on the RHS. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/NAry/Variant9f628bcd3ac9bb65f675113f733d8932ed65adcb577bb968b447c47f9457ce8c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/NAry/Variant9f628bcd3ac9bb65f675113f733d8932ed65adcb577bb968b447c47f9457ce8c.lean#L220).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `be8f8ccd316f36d06e7f650cfcde99f5e7fa500d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
