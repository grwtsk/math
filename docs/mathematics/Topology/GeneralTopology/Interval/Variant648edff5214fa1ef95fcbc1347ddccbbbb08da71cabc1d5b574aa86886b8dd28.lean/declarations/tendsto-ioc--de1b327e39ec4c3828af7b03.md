## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b52eb8d0-6ded-727f-6a5e-d94270ce6406`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 136–140.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem Tendsto.Ioc {l₁ l₂ : Filter α} [TendstoIxxClass Ioc l₁ l₂] {lb : Filter β}
    {u₁ u₂ : β → α} (h₁ : Tendsto u₁ lb l₁) (h₂ : Tendsto u₂ lb l₁) :
    Tendsto (fun x => Ioc (u₁ x) (u₂ x)) lb l₂.smallSets :=
  (@TendstoIxxClass.tendsto_Ixx α Set.Ioc _ _ _).comp <| h₁.prodMk h₂

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Interval/Variant648edff5214fa1ef95fcbc1347ddccbbbb08da71cabc1d5b574aa86886b8dd28.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Interval/Variant648edff5214fa1ef95fcbc1347ddccbbbb08da71cabc1d5b574aa86886b8dd28.lean#L136).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9c2312998c5d84dc832049100ea1651f5548c7a9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
