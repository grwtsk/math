## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e11a30ac-b22c-3cb8-2f4d-edf3b579f4da`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 31–57.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma LogDerivZetaBndAlt :
    ∃ A > 0, ∀ (σ) (_ : σ ∈ Ico ((1 : ℝ) / 2) (1 : ℝ)),
    (fun (t : ℝ) ↦ ζ' (σ + t * I) / ζ (σ + t * I)) =O[cocompact ℝ ⊓
      Filter.principal {t | 1 - A / Real.log |t| ^ 9 < σ}]
        fun t ↦ Real.log |t| ^ 9 := by
  obtain ⟨A, hA, C, _, h⟩ := LogDerivZetaBnd
  refine ⟨A, hA.1, fun σ ⟨σ_ge, σ_lt⟩ ↦ ?_⟩
  -- This could all be done much cleaner; TODO: refactor
  rw [Asymptotics.isBigO_iff]
  use C
  rw [eventually_inf, cocompact_eq_atBot_atTop]
  refine ⟨{t : ℝ | 4 ≤ |t|}, ?_, {t | 1 - A / Real.log |t| ^ 9 < σ},
    fun ⦃a⦄ a ↦ a, fun t ⟨t_ge, ht⟩ ↦ ?_⟩
  · rw [mem_sup]
    refine ⟨?_, ?_⟩
    · simp only [mem_atBot_sets, mem_setOf_eq]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ZetaBoundsUnused/Variant2c965c74b7602a3ef497324ec7d006558fc2a6d7bc9f3e2aaacc9ccd48bd32bb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ZetaBoundsUnused/Variant2c965c74b7602a3ef497324ec7d006558fc2a6d7bc9f3e2aaacc9ccd48bd32bb.lean#L31).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac078b4247fc2c396f0f9aa2bfe2ccc168257b19` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
