## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f9a551c8-8bbc-a463-c4af-7bd2813f0848`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 53–113.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Let `f : Z → C(X, Y)` be a continuous (in the compact open topology) family
of continuous measure preserving maps.
Let `t : Set Y` be a null measurable set of finite measure.
Then for any `s`, the set of parameters `z`
such that the preimage of `t` under `f_z` is a.e. equal to `s`
is a closed set.

In particular, if `X = Y` and `s = t`,
then we see that the a.e. stabilizer of a set is a closed set. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ContinuousPreimage/Variant34b60b9129d81e9e6486d66b933535f2e55dabd2c41b039d17fff63baf935256.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ContinuousPreimage/Variant34b60b9129d81e9e6486d66b933535f2e55dabd2c41b039d17fff63baf935256.lean#L53).
