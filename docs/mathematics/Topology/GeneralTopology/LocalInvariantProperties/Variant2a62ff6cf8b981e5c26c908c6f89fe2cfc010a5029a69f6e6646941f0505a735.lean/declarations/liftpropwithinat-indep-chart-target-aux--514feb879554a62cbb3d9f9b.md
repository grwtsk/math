## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:007ed8b8-8ea2-d64b-4926-b55ed31c017b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 284–300.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem liftPropWithinAt_indep_chart_target_aux {g : X → M'} {e : OpenPartialHomeomorph X H} {x : X}
    {s : Set X} (xe : x ∈ e.source)
    (hf : f ∈ G'.maximalAtlas M') (xf : g x ∈ f.source) (hgs : ContinuousWithinAt g s x) :
    P ((chartAt H' (g x)) ∘ g ∘ e.symm) (e.symm ⁻¹' s) (e x)
      ↔ P (f ∘ g ∘ e.symm) (e.symm ⁻¹' s) (e x) := by
  rw [← e.left_inv xe] at xf hgs
  rw [← hG.liftPropWithinAt_indep_chart_target_aux2 (g ∘ e.symm) hf xf]
  · simp [xe]
  · exact hgs.comp (e.symm.continuousAt <| e.mapsTo xe).continuousWithinAt Subset.rfl

/-- If a property of a germ of function `g` on a pointed set `(s, x)` is invariant under the
structure groupoid (by composition in the source space and in the target space), then
expressing it in charted spaces does not depend on the element of the maximal atlas one uses
both in the source and in the target manifolds, provided they are defined around `x` and `g x`
respectively, and provided `g` is continuous within `s` at `x` (otherwise, the local behavior
of `g` at `x` cannot be captured with a chart in the target). Version where one of the
charts is `chartAt`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalInvariantProperties/Variant2a62ff6cf8b981e5c26c908c6f89fe2cfc010a5029a69f6e6646941f0505a735.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalInvariantProperties/Variant2a62ff6cf8b981e5c26c908c6f89fe2cfc010a5029a69f6e6646941f0505a735.lean#L284).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f5331c9ae9bf2531410ac53149121976f8da9d41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
