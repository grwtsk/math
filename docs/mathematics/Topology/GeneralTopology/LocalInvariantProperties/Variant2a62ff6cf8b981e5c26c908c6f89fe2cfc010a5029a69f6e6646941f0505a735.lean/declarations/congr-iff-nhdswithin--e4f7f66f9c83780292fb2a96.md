## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8e2981ba-805d-a608-9041-52a7b3694e35`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 98–102.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem congr_iff_nhdsWithin {s : Set H} {x : H} {f g : H → H'} (h1 : f =ᶠ[𝓝[s] x] g)
    (h2 : f x = g x) : P f s x ↔ P g s x := by
  simp_rw [hG.is_local_nhds h1]
  exact ⟨hG.congr_of_forall (fun y hy ↦ hy.2) h2, hG.congr_of_forall (fun y hy ↦ hy.2.symm) h2.symm⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalInvariantProperties/Variant2a62ff6cf8b981e5c26c908c6f89fe2cfc010a5029a69f6e6646941f0505a735.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/LocalInvariantProperties/Variant2a62ff6cf8b981e5c26c908c6f89fe2cfc010a5029a69f6e6646941f0505a735.lean#L98).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f5331c9ae9bf2531410ac53149121976f8da9d41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
