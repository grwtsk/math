## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:85c9777b-cf49-6475-7e46-9eb9a0f1c263`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 167–175.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsBoundedUnder.bddAbove_range [Preorder β] [IsDirectedOrder β] {f : ℕ → β}
    (hf : IsBoundedUnder (· ≤ ·) atTop f) : BddAbove (range f) := by
  rw [← Nat.cofinite_eq_atTop] at hf
  exact hf.bddAbove_range_of_cofinite

/-- To check that a filter is frequently bounded, it suffices to have a witness
which bounds `f` at some point for every admissible set.

This is only an implication, as the other direction is wrong for the trivial filter. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/IsBounded/Variant38666f7346e1209e24521fe28c3634a1ffafc2ed5aae39c2fbfeb3c79e7a46fb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/IsBounded/Variant38666f7346e1209e24521fe28c3634a1ffafc2ed5aae39c2fbfeb3c79e7a46fb.lean#L167).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a0632c7969cafd48efce9bb8f5bcd6e44b36284f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
