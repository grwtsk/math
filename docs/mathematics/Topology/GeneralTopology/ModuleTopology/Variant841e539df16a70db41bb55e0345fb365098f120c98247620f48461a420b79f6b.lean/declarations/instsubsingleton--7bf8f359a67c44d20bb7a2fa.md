## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:09c1afea056be03e24d595767ba3e52cf85782b648e55e284c14002820633b39`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 194–206.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instSubsingleton [Subsingleton A] : IsModuleTopology R A where
  eq_moduleTopology' := Subsingleton.elim _ _

end basics

section iso

variable {R : Type*} [τR : TopologicalSpace R] [Semiring R]
variable {A : Type*} [AddCommMonoid A] [Module R A] [τA : TopologicalSpace A] [IsModuleTopology R A]
variable {B : Type*} [AddCommMonoid B] [Module R B] [τB : TopologicalSpace B]

/-- If `A` and `B` are `R`-modules, homeomorphic via an `R`-linear homeomorphism, and if
`A` has the module topology, then so does `B`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ModuleTopology/Variant841e539df16a70db41bb55e0345fb365098f120c98247620f48461a420b79f6b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ModuleTopology/Variant841e539df16a70db41bb55e0345fb365098f120c98247620f48461a420b79f6b.lean#L194).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27dc805877bd08369627e7a2f39843214cd8651c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
