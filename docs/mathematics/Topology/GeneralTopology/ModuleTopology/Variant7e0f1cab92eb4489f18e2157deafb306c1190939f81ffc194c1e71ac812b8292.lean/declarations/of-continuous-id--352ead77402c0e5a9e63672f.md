## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f71147d7-5176-8d1b-1485-dd872b8fafd9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 193–201.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem of_continuous_id [ContinuousAdd A] [ContinuousSMul R A]
    (h : @Continuous A A τA (moduleTopology R A) id) :
    IsModuleTopology R A where
  -- The topologies are equal because each is finer than the other. One inclusion
  -- follows from the continuity hypothesis; the other is because the module topology
  -- is the inf of all the topologies making `A` a topological module.
  eq_moduleTopology' := le_antisymm (continuous_id_iff_le.1 h) (moduleTopology_le _ _)

/-- The zero module has the module topology. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ModuleTopology/Variant7e0f1cab92eb4489f18e2157deafb306c1190939f81ffc194c1e71ac812b8292.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ModuleTopology/Variant7e0f1cab92eb4489f18e2157deafb306c1190939f81ffc194c1e71ac812b8292.lean#L193).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5c5ebb603a580def722fd4c059878cde00d7ab5d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
