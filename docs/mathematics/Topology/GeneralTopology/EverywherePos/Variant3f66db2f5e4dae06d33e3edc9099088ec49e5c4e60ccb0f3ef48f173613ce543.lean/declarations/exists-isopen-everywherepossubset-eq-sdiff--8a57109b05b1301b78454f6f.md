## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f79b0beb-7fee-1d00-f929-66d18bf1c4de`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–92.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    ∃ u, IsOpen u ∧ μ.everywherePosSubset s = s \ u := by
  refine ⟨{x | ∃ n ∈ 𝓝[s] x, μ n = 0}, ?_, by ext x; simp [everywherePosSubset, pos_iff_ne_zero]⟩
  rw [isOpen_iff_mem_nhds]
  intro x ⟨n, ns, hx⟩
  rcases mem_nhdsWithin_iff_exists_mem_nhds_inter.1 ns with ⟨v, vx, hv⟩
  rcases mem_nhds_iff.1 vx with ⟨w, wv, w_open, xw⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/EverywherePos/Variant3f66db2f5e4dae06d33e3edc9099088ec49e5c4e60ccb0f3ef48f173613ce543.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/EverywherePos/Variant3f66db2f5e4dae06d33e3edc9099088ec49e5c4e60ccb0f3ef48f173613ce543.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9803a5400a6aeb655a6bb7b5807be18f4b5253f2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
