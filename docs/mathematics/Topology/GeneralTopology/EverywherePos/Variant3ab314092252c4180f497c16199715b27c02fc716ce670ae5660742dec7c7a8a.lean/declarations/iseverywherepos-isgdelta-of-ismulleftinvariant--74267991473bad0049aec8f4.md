## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:124191ba-6a9d-0841-8830-d3dd9b94d866`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 213–271.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma IsEverywherePos.IsGdelta_of_isMulLeftInvariant
    {k : Set G} (h : μ.IsEverywherePos k) (hk : IsCompact k) (h'k : IsClosed k) :
    IsGδ k := by
  /- Consider a decreasing sequence of open neighborhoods `Vₙ` of the identity, such that `g k \ k`
  has small measure for all `g ∈ Vₙ`. We claim that `k = ⋂ Vₙ k`, which proves
  the lemma as the sets on the right are open. The inclusion `⊆` is trivial.
  Let us show the converse. Take `x` in the intersection. For each `n`, write `x = vₙ yₙ` with
  `vₙ ∈ Vₙ` and `yₙ ∈ k`. Let `z ∈ k` be a cluster value of `yₙ`, by compactness. As multiplication
  by `vₙ = x yₙ⁻¹ ∈ Vₙ` changes the measure of `k` by very little, passing to the limit we get
  `μ (x z⁻¹ k \ k) = 0`. By invariance of the measure under `z x ⁻¹`, we get `μ (k \ z x⁻¹ k) = 0`.
  Assume `x ∉ k`. Then `z ∈ k \ z x⁻¹ k`. Even more, this set is a neighborhood of `z` within `k`
  (as `z x⁻¹ k` is closed), and it has zero measure. This contradicts the fact that `k` has
  positive measure around the point `z`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/EverywherePos/Variant3ab314092252c4180f497c16199715b27c02fc716ce670ae5660742dec7c7a8a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
