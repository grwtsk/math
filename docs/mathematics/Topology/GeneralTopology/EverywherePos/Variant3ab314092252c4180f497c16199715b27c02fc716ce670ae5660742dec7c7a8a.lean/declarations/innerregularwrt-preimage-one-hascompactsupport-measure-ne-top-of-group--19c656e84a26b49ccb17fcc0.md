## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ff8c5953-62c4-34c5-b6b9-7efb7b43bdd3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 272–303.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem innerRegularWRT_preimage_one_hasCompactSupport_measure_ne_top_of_group :
    InnerRegularWRT μ (fun s ↦ ∃ (f : G → ℝ), Continuous f ∧ HasCompactSupport f ∧ s = f ⁻¹' {1})
    (fun s ↦ MeasurableSet s ∧ μ s ≠ ∞) := by
  /- First, approximate a measurable set from inside by a compact closed set `K`. Then notice that
  the everywhere positive subset of `K` is a Gδ,
  by Lemma `IsEverywherePos.IsGdelta_of_isMulLeftInvariant`, and therefore the level set of a
  continuous compactly supported function. Moreover, it has the same measure as `K`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/EverywherePos/Variant3ab314092252c4180f497c16199715b27c02fc716ce670ae5660742dec7c7a8a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/EverywherePos/Variant3ab314092252c4180f497c16199715b27c02fc716ce670ae5660742dec7c7a8a.lean#L272).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a90149218799648593ee2c80984825d7b65add78` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
