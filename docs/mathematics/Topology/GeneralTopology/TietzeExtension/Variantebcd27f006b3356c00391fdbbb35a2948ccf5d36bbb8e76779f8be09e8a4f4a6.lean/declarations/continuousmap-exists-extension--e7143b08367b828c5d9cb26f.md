## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8785a2bc-a9be-488a-6722-b732d262d2f1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 80–92.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContinuousMap.exists_extension (he : IsClosedEmbedding e) (f : C(X₁, Y)) :
    ∃ (g : C(X, Y)), g.comp ⟨e, he.continuous⟩ = f := by
  let e' : X₁ ≃ₜ Set.range e := he.isEmbedding.toHomeomorph
  obtain ⟨g, hg⟩ := (f.comp e'.symm).exists_restrict_eq he.isClosed_range
  exact ⟨g, by ext x; simpa using congr($(hg) ⟨e' x, x, rfl⟩)⟩

/-- **Tietze extension theorem** for `TietzeExtension` spaces. Let `e` be a closed embedding of a
nonempty topological space `X₁` into a normal topological space `X`. Let `f` be a continuous
function on `X₁` with values in a `TietzeExtension` space `Y`. Then there exists a
continuous function `g : C(X, Y)` such that `g ∘ e = f`.

This version is provided for convenience and backwards compatibility. Here the composition is
phrased in terms of bare functions. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/TietzeExtension/Variantebcd27f006b3356c00391fdbbb35a2948ccf5d36bbb8e76779f8be09e8a4f4a6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/TietzeExtension/Variantebcd27f006b3356c00391fdbbb35a2948ccf5d36bbb8e76779f8be09e8a4f4a6.lean#L80).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0d6a245ba8d83c8009f6122661fa19c696a89a22` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
