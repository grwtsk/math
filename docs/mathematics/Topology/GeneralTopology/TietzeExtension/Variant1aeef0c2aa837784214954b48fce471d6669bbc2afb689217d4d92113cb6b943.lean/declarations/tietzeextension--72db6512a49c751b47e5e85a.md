## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:88ba1de903ddea2aa0cd69e67d580c4fd351a00f6ccb96dd00947409924c58ed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 63–75.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class TietzeExtension (Y : Type v) [TopologicalSpace Y] : Prop where
  exists_restrict_eq' {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] [NormalSpace X] (s : Set X)
    (hs : IsClosed s) (f : C(s, Y)) : ∃ (g : C(X, Y)), g.restrict s = f

variable {X₁ : Type u₁} [TopologicalSpace X₁]
variable {X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace X] [NormalSpace X] {s : Set X}
variable {e : X₁ → X}
variable {Y : Type v} [TopologicalSpace Y] [TietzeExtension.{u, v} Y]

/-- **Tietze extension theorem** for `TietzeExtension` spaces, a version for a closed set. Let
`s` be a closed set in a normal topological space `X`. Let `f` be a continuous function
on `s` with values in a `TietzeExtension` space `Y`. Then there exists a continuous function
`g : C(X, Y)` such that `g.restrict s = f`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/TietzeExtension/Variant1aeef0c2aa837784214954b48fce471d6669bbc2afb689217d4d92113cb6b943.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/TietzeExtension/Variant1aeef0c2aa837784214954b48fce471d6669bbc2afb689217d4d92113cb6b943.lean#L63).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0633efa8cd3de9cc199301dabd52fea3bcc6576e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
