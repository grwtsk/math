## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:070bf0dc-ada0-c40d-9c54-9437386227ca`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 282–297.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_norm_eq_domRestrict_eq_of_closed {s : Set Y} (f : s →ᵇ ℝ) (hs : IsClosed s) :
    ∃ g : Y →ᵇ ℝ, ‖g‖ = ‖f‖ ∧ g.domRestrict s = f :=
  exists_extension_norm_eq_of_isClosedEmbedding' f ((ContinuousMap.id _).restrict s)
    hs.isClosedEmbedding_subtypeVal

@[deprecated (since := "2026-07-19")]
alias exists_norm_eq_restrict_eq_of_closed := exists_norm_eq_domRestrict_eq_of_closed

/-- **Tietze extension theorem** for real-valued bounded continuous maps, a version for a closed
embedding and a bounded continuous function that takes values in a non-trivial closed interval.
See also `exists_extension_forall_mem_of_isClosedEmbedding` for a more general statement that works
for any interval (finite or infinite, open or closed).

If `e : X → Y` is a closed embedding and `f : X →ᵇ ℝ` is a bounded continuous function such that
`f x ∈ [a, b]` for all `x`, where `a ≤ b`, then there exists a bounded continuous function
`g : Y →ᵇ ℝ` such that `g y ∈ [a, b]` for all `y` and `g ∘ e = f`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/TietzeExtension/Variantda9df031f3010298f7952de60f7b07a0269563d3926d8209e670892d3a1d410c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/TietzeExtension/Variantda9df031f3010298f7952de60f7b07a0269563d3926d8209e670892d3a1d410c.lean#L282).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9b3db329f400ab296085c00d203ded5f2010274b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
