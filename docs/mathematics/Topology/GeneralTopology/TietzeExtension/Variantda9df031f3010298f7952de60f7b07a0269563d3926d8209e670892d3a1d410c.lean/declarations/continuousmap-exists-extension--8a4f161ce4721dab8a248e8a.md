## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8a009487-237e-50e3-9d4b-15d508773375`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–99.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContinuousMap.exists_extension' (he : IsClosedEmbedding e) (f : C(X₁, Y)) :
    ∃ (g : C(X, Y)), g ∘ e = f :=
  f.exists_extension he |>.imp fun g hg ↦ by ext x; congrm($(hg) x)

/-- This theorem is not intended to be used directly because it is rare for a set alone to
satisfy `[TietzeExtension t]`. For example, `Metric.ball` in `ℝ` only satisfies it when
the radius is strictly positive, so finding this as an instance will fail.

Instead, it is intended to be used as a constructor for theorems about sets which *do* satisfy
`[TietzeExtension t]` under some hypotheses. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/TietzeExtension/Variantda9df031f3010298f7952de60f7b07a0269563d3926d8209e670892d3a1d410c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/TietzeExtension/Variantda9df031f3010298f7952de60f7b07a0269563d3926d8209e670892d3a1d410c.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9b3db329f400ab296085c00d203ded5f2010274b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
