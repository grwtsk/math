## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cc5ece7d-8aa0-40e2-347f-6a04bb0981ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 518–526.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem normal_exists_closure_subset [NormalSpace X] {s t : Set X} (hs : IsClosed s) (ht : IsOpen t)
    (hst : s ⊆ t) : ∃ u, IsOpen u ∧ s ⊆ u ∧ closure u ⊆ t := by
  have : Disjoint s tᶜ := Set.disjoint_left.mpr fun x hxs hxt => hxt (hst hxs)
  rcases normal_separation hs (isClosed_compl_iff.2 ht) this with
    ⟨s', t', hs', ht', hss', htt', hs't'⟩
  refine ⟨s', hs', hss', Subset.trans (closure_minimal ?_ (isClosed_compl_iff.2 ht'))
    (compl_subset_comm.1 htt')⟩
  exact fun x hxs hxt => hs't'.le_bot ⟨hxs, hxt⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Regular/Variantabab93be2c853a6df7bb37575f2a4e9860a6d7aaeb5cd65cb91d9dc6f18225a1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Regular/Variantabab93be2c853a6df7bb37575f2a4e9860a6d7aaeb5cd65cb91d9dc6f18225a1.lean#L518).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `71c36b384d864adad1815ba38d0f8e3435e701eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
