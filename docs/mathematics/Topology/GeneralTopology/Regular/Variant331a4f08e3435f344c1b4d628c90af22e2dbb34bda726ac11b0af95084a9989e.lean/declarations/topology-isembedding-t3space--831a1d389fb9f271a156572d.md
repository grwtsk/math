## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b0a64d87-a66e-5804-68a5-26853d6a45d2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 382–389.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem Topology.IsEmbedding.t3Space [TopologicalSpace Y] [T3Space Y] {f : X → Y}
    (hf : IsEmbedding f) : T3Space X :=
  { toT0Space := hf.t0Space
    toRegularSpace := hf.isInducing.regularSpace }

@[deprecated (since := "2024-10-26")]
alias Embedding.t3Space := IsEmbedding.t3Space

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Regular/Variant331a4f08e3435f344c1b4d628c90af22e2dbb34bda726ac11b0af95084a9989e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Regular/Variant331a4f08e3435f344c1b4d628c90af22e2dbb34bda726ac11b0af95084a9989e.lean#L382).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c1e2d4a00dc1abbada13049b6276cb7f3bfb6445` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
