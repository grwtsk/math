## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:712d7f65-d2d0-6bef-9a33-32abe683a7ed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 321–325.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem disjoint_lift'_closure_nhds [T25Space X] {x y : X} :
    Disjoint ((𝓝 x).lift' closure) ((𝓝 y).lift' closure) ↔ x ≠ y :=
  ⟨fun h hxy => by simp [hxy, nhds_neBot.ne] at h, fun h => T25Space.t2_5 h⟩

-- see Note [lower instance priority]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Regular/Variant331a4f08e3435f344c1b4d628c90af22e2dbb34bda726ac11b0af95084a9989e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Regular/Variant331a4f08e3435f344c1b4d628c90af22e2dbb34bda726ac11b0af95084a9989e.lean#L321).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c1e2d4a00dc1abbada13049b6276cb7f3bfb6445` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
