## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dab88eb4-7f9a-8fc7-3d93-daa3602a25e7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 452–459.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem Topology.IsClosedEmbedding.normalSpace [TopologicalSpace Y] [NormalSpace Y]
    {f : X → Y} (hf : IsClosedEmbedding f) : NormalSpace X where
  normal s t hs ht hst := by
    have H : SeparatedNhds (f '' s) (f '' t) :=
      NormalSpace.normal (f '' s) (f '' t) (hf.isClosedMap s hs) (hf.isClosedMap t ht)
        (disjoint_image_of_injective hf.injective hst)
    exact (H.preimage hf.continuous).mono (subset_preimage_image _ _) (subset_preimage_image _ _)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Regular/Variant331a4f08e3435f344c1b4d628c90af22e2dbb34bda726ac11b0af95084a9989e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Regular/Variant331a4f08e3435f344c1b4d628c90af22e2dbb34bda726ac11b0af95084a9989e.lean#L452).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c1e2d4a00dc1abbada13049b6276cb7f3bfb6445` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
