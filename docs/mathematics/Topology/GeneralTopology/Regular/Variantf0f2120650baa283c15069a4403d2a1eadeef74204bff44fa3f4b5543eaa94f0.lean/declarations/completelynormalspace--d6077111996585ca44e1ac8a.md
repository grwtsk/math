## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ea9c3aded2c7591faea3d2670b25aaad0ef82695b8c766ba968c988e7ffa7b13`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 616–625.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class CompletelyNormalSpace (X : Type u) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop where
  /-- If `closure s` is disjoint with `t`, and `s` is disjoint with `closure t`, then `s` and `t`
  admit disjoint neighbourhoods. -/
  completely_normal :
    ∀ ⦃s t : Set X⦄, Disjoint (closure s) t → Disjoint s (closure t) → Disjoint (𝓝ˢ s) (𝓝ˢ t)

export CompletelyNormalSpace (completely_normal)

-- see Note [lower instance priority]
/-- A completely normal space is a normal space. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Regular/Variantf0f2120650baa283c15069a4403d2a1eadeef74204bff44fa3f4b5543eaa94f0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Regular/Variantf0f2120650baa283c15069a4403d2a1eadeef74204bff44fa3f4b5543eaa94f0.lean#L616).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ab8ac2866c917f921ebfd21ae7c876899707775a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
