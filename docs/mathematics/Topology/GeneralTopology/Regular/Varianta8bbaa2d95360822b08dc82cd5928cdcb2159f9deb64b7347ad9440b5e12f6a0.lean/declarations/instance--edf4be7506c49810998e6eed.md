## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9a7f7b80d2c8eb103fa8a226b95df115738300872c8614e076d03e72f64783a3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 456–462.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) NormalSpace.of_compactSpace_r1Space [CompactSpace X] [R1Space X] :
    NormalSpace X where
  normal _s _t hs ht := .of_isCompact_isCompact_isClosed hs.isCompact ht.isCompact ht

/-- A regular topological space with a Lindelöf topology is a normal space. A consequence of e.g.
Corollaries 20.8 and 20.10 of [Willard's *General Topology*][zbMATH02107988] (without the
assumption of Hausdorff). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Regular/Varianta8bbaa2d95360822b08dc82cd5928cdcb2159f9deb64b7347ad9440b5e12f6a0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Regular/Varianta8bbaa2d95360822b08dc82cd5928cdcb2159f9deb64b7347ad9440b5e12f6a0.lean#L456).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a8b9bb6a7ff7df35d51aee4dba345015529b15de` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
