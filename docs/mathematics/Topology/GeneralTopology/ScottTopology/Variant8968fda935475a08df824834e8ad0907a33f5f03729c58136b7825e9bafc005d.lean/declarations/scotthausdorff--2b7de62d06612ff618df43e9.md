## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3221f54251d2dcbf31f1cfea788ebecef9967cf15e2ff2227edfef70254426dc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–164.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

def scottHausdorff (α : Type*) (D : Set (Set α)) [Preorder α] : TopologicalSpace α where
  IsOpen u := ∀ ⦃d : Set α⦄, d ∈ D → d.Nonempty → DirectedOn (· ≤ ·) d → ∀ ⦃a : α⦄, IsLUB d a →
    a ∈ u → ∃ b ∈ d, Ici b ∩ d ⊆ u

variable (α) (D : Set (Set α)) [Preorder α] [TopologicalSpace α]

/-- Predicate for an ordered topological space to be equipped with its Scott-Hausdorff topology.

A set `u` is open in the Scott-Hausdorff topology iff when the least upper bound of a directed set
`d` lies in `u` then there is a tail of `d` which is a subset of `u`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ScottTopology/Variant8968fda935475a08df824834e8ad0907a33f5f03729c58136b7825e9bafc005d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ScottTopology/Variant8968fda935475a08df824834e8ad0907a33f5f03729c58136b7825e9bafc005d.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0e70ba6638b52955640391a74b81ec8d17a97e53` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
