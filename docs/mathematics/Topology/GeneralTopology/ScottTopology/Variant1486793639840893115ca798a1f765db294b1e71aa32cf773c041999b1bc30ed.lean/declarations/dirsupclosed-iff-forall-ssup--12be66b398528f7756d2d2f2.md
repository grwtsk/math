## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1c9ca70e-f9c4-e962-032e-04841129a61c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 138–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma dirSupClosed_iff_forall_sSup :
    DirSupClosed s ↔ ∀ ⦃d⦄, d.Nonempty → DirectedOn (· ≤ ·) d → d ⊆ s → sSup d ∈ s := by
  simp [DirSupClosed, isLUB_iff_sSup_eq]

namespace Topology

/-! ### Scott-Hausdorff topology -/

section ScottHausdorff

/-- The Scott-Hausdorff topology.

A set `u` is open in the Scott-Hausdorff topology iff when the least upper bound of a directed set
`d` lies in `u` then there is a tail of `d` which is a subset of `u`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ScottTopology/Variant1486793639840893115ca798a1f765db294b1e71aa32cf773c041999b1bc30ed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ScottTopology/Variant1486793639840893115ca798a1f765db294b1e71aa32cf773c041999b1bc30ed.lean#L138).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `43a71df3592ef86ca5339c89a845585e58ae5f93` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
