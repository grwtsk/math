## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3cdbda36-6086-b58b-42ff-541c22cbda78`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 489–503.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem trans_pi_eq_pi_trans (γ₀ : ∀ i, Path (as i) (bs i)) (γ₁ : ∀ i, Path (bs i) (cs i)) :
    (Path.pi γ₀).trans (Path.pi γ₁) = Path.pi fun i => (γ₀ i).trans (γ₁ i) := by
  ext t i
  unfold Path.trans
  simp only [Path.coe_mk_mk, Function.comp_apply, pi_coe]

/-- Pointwise multiplication of paths in a topological group. The additive version is probably more
useful. -/
@[to_additive "Pointwise addition of paths in a topological additive group."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Path/Variant9b9eb0ea3f40e67534e84e061c0ee8bc1fcb3117a4c925780fef61674bd37d23.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Path/Variant9b9eb0ea3f40e67534e84e061c0ee8bc1fcb3117a4c925780fef61674bd37d23.lean#L489).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aec8ccb7153a1169a54f9497118a91927c1439b0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
