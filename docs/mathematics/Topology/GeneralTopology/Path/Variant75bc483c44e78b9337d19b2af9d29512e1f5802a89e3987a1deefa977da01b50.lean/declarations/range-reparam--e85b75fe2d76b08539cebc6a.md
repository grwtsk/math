## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:892dc18a-19cd-d160-e682-4f45f3a2f9d8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 636–649.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem range_reparam (γ : Path x y) {f : I → I} (hfcont : Continuous f) (hf₀ : f 0 = 0)
    (hf₁ : f 1 = 1) : range (γ.reparam f hfcont hf₀ hf₁) = range γ := by
  change range (γ ∘ f) = range γ
  have : range f = univ := by
    rw [range_eq_univ]
    intro t
    have h₁ : Continuous (Set.IccExtend (zero_le_one' ℝ) f) := by fun_prop
    have := intermediate_value_Icc (zero_le_one' ℝ) h₁.continuousOn
    · rw [IccExtend_left, IccExtend_right, Icc.mk_zero, Icc.mk_one, hf₀, hf₁] at this
      rcases this t.2 with ⟨w, hw₁, hw₂⟩
      rw [IccExtend_of_mem _ _ hw₁] at hw₂
      exact ⟨_, hw₂⟩
  rw [range_comp, this, image_univ]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Path/Variant75bc483c44e78b9337d19b2af9d29512e1f5802a89e3987a1deefa977da01b50.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Path/Variant75bc483c44e78b9337d19b2af9d29512e1f5802a89e3987a1deefa977da01b50.lean#L636).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `48625f2f31dd3d25317df6a4a4b43931ae08ecc9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
