## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4078923a-0d33-4abc-450a-7bfb01986216`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 449–459.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem continuous_trans {x y z : X} : Continuous fun ρ : Path x y × Path y z => ρ.1.trans ρ.2 := by
  fun_prop


/-! #### Product of paths -/
section Prod

variable {a₁ a₂ a₃ : X} {b₁ b₂ b₃ : Y}

/-- Given a path in `X` and a path in `Y`, we can take their pointwise product to get a path in
`X × Y`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Path/Varianta06a2be592c1944825e8df4b940609178aa8e186ad44a7e63ce0193b4fb36366.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Path/Varianta06a2be592c1944825e8df4b940609178aa8e186ad44a7e63ce0193b4fb36366.lean#L449).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d03853126d4b7e36b4b1643cb3e3842198d44e75` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
