## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:45237f50-7b9d-f38b-8b3c-e1574cfc9b05`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 555–564.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem truncate_range {a b : X} (γ : Path a b) {t₀ t₁ : ℝ} :
    range (γ.truncate t₀ t₁) ⊆ range γ := by
  rw [← γ.extend_range]
  simp only [range_subset_iff, SetCoe.exists, SetCoe.forall]
  intro x _hx
  simp only [DFunLike.coe, Path.truncate, mem_range_self]

/-- For a path `γ`, `γ.truncate` gives a "continuous family of paths", by which we mean
the uncurried function which maps `(t₀, t₁, s)` to `γ.truncate t₀ t₁ s` is continuous. -/
@[continuity]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Path/Varianta06a2be592c1944825e8df4b940609178aa8e186ad44a7e63ce0193b4fb36366.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Path/Varianta06a2be592c1944825e8df4b940609178aa8e186ad44a7e63ce0193b4fb36366.lean#L555).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d03853126d4b7e36b4b1643cb3e3842198d44e75` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
