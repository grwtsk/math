## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bad6f9cb-8c2d-6d66-b171-4df6ddc95cee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 590–600.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma locallyBoundedVariation_ofDual {f : α → E} {s : Set α} :
    LocallyBoundedVariationOn (f ∘ ofDual) (ofDual ⁻¹' s) ↔ LocallyBoundedVariationOn f s :=
  ⟨fun h ↦ h.ofDual, fun h ↦ h.ofDual⟩

end Monotone

/-! ### Left and right limits of bounded variation functions -/

/-- The variation of a function on `Iic a` is the sum of the variation on `Iio a` and the
contribution of `a`, i.e., the distance between the left limit and the value at `a`.
We give a version relative to a set `s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/BoundedVariation/Variant0fc7f9610eb1d559cc8c30e52de5b7dd8eaa0588ef6bcc505e860417703876ca.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/BoundedVariation/Variant0fc7f9610eb1d559cc8c30e52de5b7dd8eaa0588ef6bcc505e860417703876ca.lean#L590).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d8f3dcfb0b40e8f24ecb0d0b676b5a094265e902` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
