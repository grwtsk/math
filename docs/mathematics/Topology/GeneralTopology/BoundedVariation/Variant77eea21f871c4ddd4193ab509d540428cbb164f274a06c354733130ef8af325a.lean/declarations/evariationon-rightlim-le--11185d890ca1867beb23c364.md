## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b0028f5a-c791-c6a5-2a04-aa6ee92fdc61`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1092–1098.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma eVariationOn_rightLim_le [TopologicalSpace α] [OrderTopology α] {f : α → M}
    {s : Set α} (hs : IsOpen s) :
    eVariationOn f.rightLim s ≤ eVariationOn f s := by
  apply eVariationOn_le_of_mapClusterPt (fun x hx ↦ ?_)
  rw [IsOpen.nhdsWithin_eq hs hx]
  exact (mapClusterPt_rightLim f x).mono nhdsWithin_le_nhds

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/BoundedVariation/Variant77eea21f871c4ddd4193ab509d540428cbb164f274a06c354733130ef8af325a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/BoundedVariation/Variant77eea21f871c4ddd4193ab509d540428cbb164f274a06c354733130ef8af325a.lean#L1092).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b6113d88eb9b6e6624402490680f712822dc8815` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
