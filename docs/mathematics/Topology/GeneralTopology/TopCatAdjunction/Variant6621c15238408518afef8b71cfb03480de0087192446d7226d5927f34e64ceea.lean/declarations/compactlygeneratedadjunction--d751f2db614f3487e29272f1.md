## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:af325a5b95c4aab5914f50d196e4feac6ae5e1691d58f27d6a710b1fd6e9e5fd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 169–178.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def compactlyGeneratedAdjunction :
    condensedSetToCompactlyGenerated ⊣ compactlyGeneratedToCondensedSet :=
  topCatAdjunction.restrictFullyFaithful (iC := 𝟭 _) (iD := compactlyGeneratedToTop)
    (Functor.FullyFaithful.id _) fullyFaithfulCompactlyGeneratedToTop
    (Iso.refl _) (Iso.refl _)

/--
The counit of the adjunction `condensedSetToCompactlyGenerated ⊣ compactlyGeneratedToCondensedSet`
is a homeomorphism.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/TopCatAdjunction/Variant6621c15238408518afef8b71cfb03480de0087192446d7226d5927f34e64ceea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/TopCatAdjunction/Variant6621c15238408518afef8b71cfb03480de0087192446d7226d5927f34e64ceea.lean#L169).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2bfb89ffd408d3c6d85409f0b0baa42964d40190` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
