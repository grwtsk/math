## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7ca6cc99f46d40b24186370e9a7706a6d09e8e948ce4d297ccc836d69c3fe81a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 76–85.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def topCatAdjunctionCounit (X : TopCat.{u}) : X.toLightCondSet.toTopCat ⟶ X :=
  TopCat.ofHom
  { toFun x := x.1 PUnit.unit
    continuous_toFun := by
      rw [continuous_coinduced_dom]
      continuity }

/-- The counit of the adjunction `lightCondSetToTopCat ⊣ topCatToLightCondSet` is always bijective,
but not an isomorphism in general (the inverse isn't continuous unless `X` is sequential).
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/TopCatAdjunction/Variant960a7cbd3c3f3f475dfc734e81835c42ab7aa1521b0641ae2576e44b33cf1120.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/TopCatAdjunction/Variant960a7cbd3c3f3f475dfc734e81835c42ab7aa1521b0641ae2576e44b33cf1120.lean#L76).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27ce1c170de994743e5312b01a4b727da5ab8420` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
