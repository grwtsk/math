## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:196e3370-f945-cd94-6542-d826027bf663`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma topCatAdjunctionCounit_hom_apply (X : TopCat) (x) :
    -- We have to specify here to not infer the `TopologicalSpace` instance on `C(PUnit, X)`,
    -- which suggests type synonyms are being unfolded too far somewhere.
    DFunLike.coe (F := @ContinuousMap C(PUnit, X) X (_) _)
        (TopCat.Hom.hom (topCatAdjunctionCounit X)) x =
      x PUnit.unit := rfl

/-- The counit of the adjunction `condensedSetToTopCat ⊣ topCatToCondensedSet` is always bijective,
but not an isomorphism in general (the inverse isn't continuous unless `X` is compactly generated).
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/TopCatAdjunction/Variantf5a024a7d3a4df05e88128deea3693c2c1ea6118b20fda668bf1b570cf83f3ef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/TopCatAdjunction/Variantf5a024a7d3a4df05e88128deea3693c2c1ea6118b20fda668bf1b570cf83f3ef.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a8cec319605e53783c43e01d50cd5b893844f6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
