## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a7616c53533ac201dad010bfd177a6693fb720b9866d9ad90aee2a11992307db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 35–41.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def CondensedSet.coinducingCoprod :
    (Σ (i : (S : CompHaus.{u}) × X.val.obj ⟨S⟩), i.fst) → X.val.obj ⟨of PUnit⟩ :=
  fun ⟨⟨_, i⟩, s⟩ ↦ X.val.map ((of PUnit.{u + 1}).const s).op i

/-- Let `X` be a condensed set. We define a topology on `X(*)` as the quotient topology of
all the maps from compact Hausdorff `S` spaces to `X(*)`, corresponding to elements of `X(S)`.
In other words, the topology coinduced by the map `CondensedSet.coinducingCoprod` above. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/TopCatAdjunction/Variantf5a024a7d3a4df05e88128deea3693c2c1ea6118b20fda668bf1b570cf83f3ef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/TopCatAdjunction/Variantf5a024a7d3a4df05e88128deea3693c2c1ea6118b20fda668bf1b570cf83f3ef.lean#L35).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a8cec319605e53783c43e01d50cd5b893844f6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
