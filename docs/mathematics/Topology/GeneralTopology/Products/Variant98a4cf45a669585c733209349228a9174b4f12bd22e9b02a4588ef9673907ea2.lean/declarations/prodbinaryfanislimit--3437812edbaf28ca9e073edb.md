## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:71f45950c3a6051c4efab733720e2e65746a6d1c8f3297457e201e34c54467d0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 136–156.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def prodBinaryFanIsLimit (X Y : TopCat.{u}) : IsLimit (prodBinaryFan X Y) where
  lift := fun S : BinaryFan X Y => ofHom {
    toFun := fun s => (S.fst s, S.snd s)
    continuous_toFun := by continuity }
  fac := by
    rintro S (_ | _) <;> {dsimp; ext; rfl}
  uniq := by
    intro S m h
    ext x
    -- Porting note (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/11041): used to be part of `ext x`
    refine Prod.ext ?_ ?_
    · specialize h ⟨WalkingPair.left⟩
      apply_fun fun e => e x at h
      exact h
    · specialize h ⟨WalkingPair.right⟩
      apply_fun fun e => e x at h
      exact h

/-- The homeomorphism between `X ⨯ Y` and the set-theoretic product of `X` and `Y`,
equipped with the product topology.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Products/Variant98a4cf45a669585c733209349228a9174b4f12bd22e9b02a4588ef9673907ea2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Products/Variant98a4cf45a669585c733209349228a9174b4f12bd22e9b02a4588ef9673907ea2.lean#L136).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9c64e66c24f75ba22787954cea811d87b09e00f8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
