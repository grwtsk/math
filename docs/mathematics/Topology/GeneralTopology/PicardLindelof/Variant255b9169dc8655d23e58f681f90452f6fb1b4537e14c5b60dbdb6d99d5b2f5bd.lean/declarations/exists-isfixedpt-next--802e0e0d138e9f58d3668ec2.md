## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a851258e-4e3a-2916-255e-dbd1a8053b5e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 400–414.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma exists_isFixedPt_next [CompleteSpace E] (hf : IsPicardLindelof f t₀ x₀ a r L K)
    (hx : x ∈ closedBall x₀ r) :
    ∃ α : FunSpace t₀ x₀ r L, IsFixedPt (next hf hx) α :=
  let ⟨_, _, h⟩ := exists_contractingWith_iterate_next hf
  ⟨_, h x hx |>.isFixedPt_fixedPoint_iterate⟩

/-! ## Lipschitz continuity of the solution with respect to the initial condition

The proof relies on the fact that the repeated application of `next` to any curve `α` converges to
the fixed point of `next`, so it suffices to bound the distance between `α` and `next^[n] α`. Since
there is some `m : ℕ` such that `next^[m]` is a contracting map, it further suffices to bound the
distance between `α` and `next^[m]^[n] α`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/PicardLindelof/Variant255b9169dc8655d23e58f681f90452f6fb1b4537e14c5b60dbdb6d99d5b2f5bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/PicardLindelof/Variant255b9169dc8655d23e58f681f90452f6fb1b4537e14c5b60dbdb6d99d5b2f5bd.lean#L400).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `914aafa576d0474f49ba074168c387ae6059e2ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
