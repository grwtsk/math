## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d9df4453-775c-5b3a-2f00-4cd17c4ecfa8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 67–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma continuous_deriv_LFunction_horizontal (hχ1 : χ ≠ 1) :
    Continuous (fun σ : ℝ => deriv χ.LFunction (σ + T * I)) := by
  have hγ : Continuous (fun σ : ℝ => (σ : ℂ) + T * I) := by fun_prop
  have hA : AnalyticOnNhd ℂ χ.LFunction univ := LFunction_analyticOnNhd hχ1
  exact hA.deriv.continuousOn.comp_continuous hγ (fun _ => mem_univ _)

/-- `σ ↦ ζ'/ζ(σ+iT)` is continuous on `[1/2,2]` when ζ has no zero on that segment. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/BacklundChi/Variant25f8bee28c0f94d9eb3b9d032367bd83a82c4597f70716ec4bf1963e178208b4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/BacklundChi/Variant25f8bee28c0f94d9eb3b9d032367bd83a82c4597f70716ec4bf1963e178208b4.lean#L67).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `07d5bcacede31f7967ba4ba5a412b8f32dd72556` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
