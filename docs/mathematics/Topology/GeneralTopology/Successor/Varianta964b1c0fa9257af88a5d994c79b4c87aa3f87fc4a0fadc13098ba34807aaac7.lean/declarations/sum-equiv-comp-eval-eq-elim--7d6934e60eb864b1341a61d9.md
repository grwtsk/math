## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f84b74f0-abea-4476-78f3-3a8833e23e61`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 355–383.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
theorem sum_equiv_comp_eval_eq_elim : eval C ∘ (sum_equiv C hsC ho).toFun =
    (Sum.elim (fun (l : GoodProducts (π C (ord I · < o))) ↦ Products.eval C l.1)
    (fun (l : MaxProducts C ho) ↦ Products.eval C l.1)) := by
  ext ⟨_, _⟩ <;> [rfl; rfl]

/-- Let

`N := LocallyConstant (π C (ord I · < o)) ℤ`

`M := LocallyConstant C ℤ`

`P := LocallyConstant (C' C ho) ℤ`

`ι := GoodProducts (π C (ord I · < o))`

`ι' := GoodProducts (C' C ho')`

`v : ι → N := GoodProducts.eval (π C (ord I · < o))`

Then `SumEval C ho` is the map `u` in the diagram below. It is linearly independent if and only if
`GoodProducts.eval C` is, see `linearIndependent_iff_sum`. The top row is the exact sequence given
by `succ_exact` and `succ_mono`. The left square commutes by `GoodProducts.square_commutes`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Successor/Varianta964b1c0fa9257af88a5d994c79b4c87aa3f87fc4a0fadc13098ba34807aaac7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Successor/Varianta964b1c0fa9257af88a5d994c79b4c87aa3f87fc4a0fadc13098ba34807aaac7.lean#L355).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fa01c6e1852d49b0a223015a3ecbf0f081443f62` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
