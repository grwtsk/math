## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8e9d17da-3f8a-6ea6-be84-2b1ce84bf6c6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 257–268.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem Multipliable.tprod_eq_zero_mul [T2Space G] {f : ℕ → G} (hf : Multipliable f) :
    ∏' b, f b = f 0 * ∏' b, f (b + 1) :=
  tprod_eq_zero_mul' <| (multipliable_nat_add_iff 1).2 hf

@[deprecated (since := "2025-04-12")] alias tsum_eq_zero_add := Summable.tsum_eq_zero_add
@[to_additive existing, deprecated (since := "2025-04-12")] alias tprod_eq_zero_mul :=
  Multipliable.tprod_eq_zero_mul

/-- For `f : ℕ → G`, the product `∏' k, f (k + i)` tends to one. This does not require a
multipliability assumption on `f`, as otherwise all such products are one. -/
@[to_additive "For `f : ℕ → G`, the sum `∑' k, f (k + i)` tends to zero. This does not require a
summability assumption on `f`, as otherwise all such sums are zero."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/NatInt/Variant0f445b997a7f48ed998d735b8d260c5470e1fe41af1ef9108b849e5cf5b4e508.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/NatInt/Variant0f445b997a7f48ed998d735b8d260c5470e1fe41af1ef9108b849e5cf5b4e508.lean#L257).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5071414aef3e355f531ae4bd3ccdb26cca49c783` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
