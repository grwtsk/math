## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e8d33302-b397-83c0-05ad-8ed8af213053`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 380–390.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma tprod_of_nat_of_neg_add_one [T2Space M] {f : ℤ → M}
    (hf₁ : Multipliable fun n : ℕ ↦ f n) (hf₂ : Multipliable fun n : ℕ ↦ f (-(n + 1))) :
    ∏' n : ℤ, f n = (∏' n : ℕ, f n) * ∏' n : ℕ, f (-(n + 1)) :=
  (hf₁.hasProd.of_nat_of_neg_add_one hf₂.hasProd).tprod_eq

/-- If `f₀, f₁, f₂, ...` and `g₀, g₁, g₂, ...` have products `a`, `b` respectively, then
the `ℤ`-indexed sequence: `..., g₂, g₁, g₀, f₀, f₁, f₂, ...` (with `f₀` at the `0`-th position) has
product `a * b`. -/
@[to_additive /-- If `f₀, f₁, f₂, ...` and `g₀, g₁, g₂, ...` have sums `a`, `b` respectively, then
the `ℤ`-indexed sequence: `..., g₂, g₁, g₀, f₀, f₁, f₂, ...` (with `f₀` at the `0`-th position) has
sum `a + b`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/NatInt/Variantda65a7ff7616b425f66a159afe4653d9c99269b67503dc8809658bec78e4df1e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/NatInt/Variantda65a7ff7616b425f66a159afe4653d9c99269b67503dc8809658bec78e4df1e.lean#L380).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `624c07c9320fefeeaaa58de5950a512fe2c38641` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
