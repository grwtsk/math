## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c30a2ebc-fcf0-f718-3205-e6252c6169ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 607–614.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[to_additive] lemma ProperlyDiscontinuousSMul.finite_stabilizer [ProperlyDiscontinuousSMul Γ T]
    (x : T) : (MulAction.stabilizer Γ x : Set Γ).Finite :=
  ProperlyDiscontinuousSMul.finite_stabilizer' Γ x

/-- The quotient map by a group action is open, i.e. the quotient by a group action is an open
  quotient. -/
@[to_additive /-- The quotient map by a group action is open, i.e. the quotient by a group
action is an open quotient. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ConstMulAction/Variantf3f7944dcd1459d49e871f7225ae1f8814bfbed6631bdc29d6f8222404d9b4a9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ConstMulAction/Variantf3f7944dcd1459d49e871f7225ae1f8814bfbed6631bdc29d6f8222404d9b4a9.lean#L607).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ab706d218dd7d59f5e2725582a619d833d3670d3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
