## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d25f4a0b-b090-6dfd-982a-5de37fed4a5e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 570–583.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem set_smul_mem_nhds_smul_iff {c : G₀} {s : Set α} {x : α} (hc : c ≠ 0) :
    c • s ∈ 𝓝 (c • x : α) ↔ s ∈ 𝓝 x := by
  refine' ⟨fun h => _, fun h => set_smul_mem_nhds_smul h hc⟩
  rw [← inv_smul_smul₀ hc x, ← inv_smul_smul₀ hc s]
  exact set_smul_mem_nhds_smul h (inv_ne_zero hc)
#align set_smul_mem_nhds_smul_iff set_smul_mem_nhds_smul_iff

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ConstMulAction/Variant7d16a0b4a131485454c60a9c1d15c9316fe8422b2c8816ae7bad2333e762188b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ConstMulAction/Variant7d16a0b4a131485454c60a9c1d15c9316fe8422b2c8816ae7bad2333e762188b.lean#L570).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `05b1fb90ce2c8759e7841b11e51ceaf211b96e95` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
