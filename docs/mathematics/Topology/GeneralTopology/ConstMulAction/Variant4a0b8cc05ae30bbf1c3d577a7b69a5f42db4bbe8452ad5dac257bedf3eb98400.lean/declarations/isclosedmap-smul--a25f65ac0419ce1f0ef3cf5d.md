## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0839eeb8-acc1-545e-45d0-c17e91080ec9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 443–454.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
nonrec theorem isClosedMap_smul (hc : IsUnit c) : IsClosedMap fun x : α => c • x :=
  let ⟨u, hu⟩ := hc
  hu ▸ isClosedMap_smul u
#align is_unit.is_closed_map_smul IsUnit.isClosedMap_smul

end IsUnit

-- porting note: todo: use `Set.Nonempty`
/-- Class `ProperlyDiscontinuousSMul Γ T` says that the scalar multiplication `(•) : Γ → T → T`
is properly discontinuous, that is, for any pair of compact sets `K, L` in `T`, only finitely many
`γ:Γ` move `K` to have nontrivial intersection with `L`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ConstMulAction/Variant4a0b8cc05ae30bbf1c3d577a7b69a5f42db4bbe8452ad5dac257bedf3eb98400.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ConstMulAction/Variant4a0b8cc05ae30bbf1c3d577a7b69a5f42db4bbe8452ad5dac257bedf3eb98400.lean#L443).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4b296a5768b6f6955b4baca1d569971067ae4cc8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
