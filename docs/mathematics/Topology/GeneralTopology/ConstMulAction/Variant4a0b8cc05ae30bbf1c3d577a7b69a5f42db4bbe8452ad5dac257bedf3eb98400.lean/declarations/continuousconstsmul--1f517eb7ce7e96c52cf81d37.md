## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6f4b550121279eeb38cc712a47e0fce231306272dc275bf11b471885e5b50bf9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 53–63.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class ContinuousConstSMul (Γ : Type*) (T : Type*) [TopologicalSpace T] [SMul Γ T] : Prop where
  /-- The scalar multiplication `(•) : Γ → T → T` is continuous in the second argument. -/
  continuous_const_smul : ∀ γ : Γ, Continuous fun x : T => γ • x
#align has_continuous_const_smul ContinuousConstSMul

/-- Class `ContinuousConstVAdd Γ T` says that the additive action `(+ᵥ) : Γ → T → T`
is continuous in the second argument. We use the same class for all kinds of additive actions,
including (semi)modules and algebras.

Note that both `ContinuousConstVAdd α α` and `ContinuousConstVAdd αᵐᵒᵖ α` are
weaker versions of `ContinuousVAdd α`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/ConstMulAction/Variant4a0b8cc05ae30bbf1c3d577a7b69a5f42db4bbe8452ad5dac257bedf3eb98400.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/ConstMulAction/Variant4a0b8cc05ae30bbf1c3d577a7b69a5f42db4bbe8452ad5dac257bedf3eb98400.lean#L53).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4b296a5768b6f6955b4baca1d569971067ae4cc8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
