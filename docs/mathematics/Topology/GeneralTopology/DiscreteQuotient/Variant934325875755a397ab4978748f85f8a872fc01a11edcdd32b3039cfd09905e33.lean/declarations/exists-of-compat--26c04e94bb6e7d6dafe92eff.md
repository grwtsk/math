## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:166a6a2c-5c60-88e9-55cc-ea57aa7ddcb8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 339–352.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (compat : ∀ (A B : DiscreteQuotient X) (h : A ≤ B), ofLE h (Qs _) = Qs _) :
    ∃ x : X, ∀ Q : DiscreteQuotient X, Q.proj x = Qs _ := by
  have H₁ : ∀ Q₁ Q₂, Q₁ ≤ Q₂ → proj Q₁ ⁻¹' {Qs Q₁} ⊆ proj Q₂ ⁻¹' {Qs Q₂} := fun _ _ h => by
    rw [← compat _ _ h]

  obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ : Set.Nonempty (⋂ Q, proj Q ⁻¹' {Qs Q}) :=
    IsCompact.nonempty_iInter_of_directed_nonempty_isCompact_isClosed
      (fun Q : DiscreteQuotient X => Q.proj ⁻¹' {Qs _}) (directed_of_isDirected_ge H₁)
      (fun Q => (singleton_nonempty _).preimage Q.proj_surjective)
      (fun Q => (Q.isClosed_preimage {Qs _}).isCompact) fun Q => Q.isClosed_preimage _
  exact ⟨x, mem_iInter.1 hx⟩

/-- If `X` is a compact space, then any discrete quotient of `X` is finite. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/DiscreteQuotient/Variant934325875755a397ab4978748f85f8a872fc01a11edcdd32b3039cfd09905e33.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/DiscreteQuotient/Variant934325875755a397ab4978748f85f8a872fc01a11edcdd32b3039cfd09905e33.lean#L339).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0ffbc45dfbd9f3c914c99feb2158033f3825d5ca` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
