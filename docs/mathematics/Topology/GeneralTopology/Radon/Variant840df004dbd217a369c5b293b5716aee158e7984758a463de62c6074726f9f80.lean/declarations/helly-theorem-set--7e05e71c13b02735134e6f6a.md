## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:36f1b434-c2fa-952e-edc1-b60737832cc8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 182–197.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem helly_theorem_set {F : Finset (Set E)}
    (h_card : finrank 𝕜 E + 1 ≤ #F)
    (h_convex : ∀ X ∈ F, Convex 𝕜 X)
    (h_inter : ∀ G : Finset (Set E), G ⊆ F → #G = finrank 𝕜 E + 1 → (⋂₀ G : Set E).Nonempty) :
    (⋂₀ (F : Set (Set E))).Nonempty := by
  apply helly_theorem_set' h_convex
  intro I hI_ss hI_card
  obtain ⟨J, _, hJ_ss, hJ_card⟩ := exists_subsuperset_card_eq hI_ss hI_card h_card
  have : ⋂₀ (J : Set (Set E)) ⊆ ⋂₀ I := sInter_mono (by simpa [hI_ss])
  apply Set.Nonempty.mono this
  exact h_inter J hJ_ss (by omega)

/-- **Helly's theorem** for families of compact convex sets.

If `F` is a family of compact convex sets in a vector space of finite dimension `d`, and any
`k ≤ d + 1` sets of `F` intersect nontrivially, then all sets of `F` intersect nontrivially. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Radon/Variant840df004dbd217a369c5b293b5716aee158e7984758a463de62c6074726f9f80.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Radon/Variant840df004dbd217a369c5b293b5716aee158e7984758a463de62c6074726f9f80.lean#L182).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `39f8584d22b685de4c38c088dc1fd6d7892b0bbe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
