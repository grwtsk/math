## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0e2c6314-8249-b71a-7937-5cb8aa9f275b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 292–303.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nhds_mul (x y : G) : 𝓝 (x * y) = 𝓝 x * 𝓝 y :=
  calc
    𝓝 (x * y) = map (x * ·) (map (· * y) (𝓝 1 * 𝓝 1)) := by simp
    _ = map₂ (fun a b => x * (a * b * y)) (𝓝 1) (𝓝 1) := by rw [← map₂_mul, map_map₂, map_map₂]
    _ = map₂ (fun a b => x * a * (b * y)) (𝓝 1) (𝓝 1) := by simp only [mul_assoc]
    _ = 𝓝 x * 𝓝 y := by
      rw [← map_mul_left_nhds_one x, ← map_mul_right_nhds_one y, ← map₂_mul, map₂_map_left,
        map₂_map_right]

/-- On a topological group, `𝓝 : G → Filter G` can be promoted to a `MulHom`. -/
@[to_additive (attr := simps)
  /-- On an additive topological group, `𝓝 : G → Filter G` can be promoted to an `AddHom`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/GeneralTopology/Neighborhood/Variant24d6e10f1236984f53c98c1f2df29766f4b92d8ad7735ac1531d8db116be428b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/GeneralTopology/Neighborhood/Variant24d6e10f1236984f53c98c1f2df29766f4b92d8ad7735ac1531d8db116be428b.lean#L292).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9f001740a81132036b29324daefca70a9d5e64e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
