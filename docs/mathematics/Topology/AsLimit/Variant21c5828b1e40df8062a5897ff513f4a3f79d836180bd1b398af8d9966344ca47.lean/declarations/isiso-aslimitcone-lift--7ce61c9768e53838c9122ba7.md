## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2642f9de9ede090d82a65781f18864f1a9f18805044800ca8efda2fe54d1cadd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–81.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isIso_asLimitCone_lift : IsIso ((limitConeIsLimit.{u, u} X.diagram).lift X.asLimitCone) :=
  CompHausLike.isIso_of_bijective _
    (by
      refine ⟨fun a b h => ?_, fun a => ?_⟩
      · refine DiscreteQuotient.eq_of_forall_proj_eq fun S => ?_
        apply_fun fun f : (limitCone.{u, u} X.diagram).pt => f.val S at h
        exact h
      · obtain ⟨b, hb⟩ :=
          DiscreteQuotient.exists_of_compat (fun S => a.val S) fun _ _ h => a.prop (homOfLE h)
        use b
        -- ext S : 3 -- Porting note (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/11041): `ext` does not work, replaced with following
        -- three lines.
        apply Subtype.ext
        apply funext
        rintro S
        -- Porting note: end replacement block
        apply hb
    )

/-- The isomorphism between `X` and the explicit limit of `X.diagram`,
induced by lifting `X.asLimitCone`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/AsLimit/Variant21c5828b1e40df8062a5897ff513f4a3f79d836180bd1b398af8d9966344ca47.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AsLimit/Variant21c5828b1e40df8062a5897ff513f4a3f79d836180bd1b398af8d9966344ca47.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cdadfa8390608ae51ae4a97c0466322e7709f678` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
