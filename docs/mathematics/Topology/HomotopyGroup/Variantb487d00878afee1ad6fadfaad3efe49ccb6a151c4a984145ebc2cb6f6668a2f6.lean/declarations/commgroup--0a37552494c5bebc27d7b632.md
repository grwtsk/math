## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ca33f3094da9aeae10a8357d1ae5636b7aa61cbf43e473b0e1f3458e9d63d58d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 578–588.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance commGroup [Nontrivial N] : CommGroup (HomotopyGroup N X x) :=
  let h := exists_ne (Classical.arbitrary N)
  @EckmannHilton.commGroup (HomotopyGroup N X x) _ 1 (isUnital_auxGroup <| Classical.choose h) _
    (by
      rintro ⟨a⟩ ⟨b⟩ ⟨c⟩ ⟨d⟩
      apply congr_arg Quotient.mk'
      simp only [fromLoop_trans_toLoop, transAt_distrib <| Classical.choose_spec h, coe_toEquiv,
        loopHomeo_apply, coe_symm_toEquiv, loopHomeo_symm_apply])
#align homotopy_group.comm_group HomotopyGroup.commGroup

end HomotopyGroup
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/HomotopyGroup/Variantb487d00878afee1ad6fadfaad3efe49ccb6a151c4a984145ebc2cb6f6668a2f6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/HomotopyGroup/Variantb487d00878afee1ad6fadfaad3efe49ccb6a151c4a984145ebc2cb6f6668a2f6.lean#L578).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d4486de2bc267c81b7ddb3df318e39c428d07058` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
