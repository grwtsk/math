## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:401b0d82d4ede0657c7ee17ece5a55f162e5138b5009eeecaf12d476b1f83b76`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 201–213.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Profinite.toCompHausEquivalence (X : CompHaus.{u}) (Y : Profinite.{u}) :
    (CompHaus.toProfiniteObj X ⟶ Y) ≃ (X ⟶ profiniteToCompHaus.obj Y) where
  toFun f := f.comp ⟨Quotient.mk'', continuous_quotient_mk'⟩
  invFun g :=
    { toFun := Continuous.connectedComponentsLift g.2
      continuous_toFun := Continuous.connectedComponentsLift_continuous g.2 }
  left_inv _ := ContinuousMap.ext <| ConnectedComponents.surjective_coe.forall.2 fun _ => rfl
  right_inv _ := ContinuousMap.ext fun _ => rfl
#align Profinite.to_CompHaus_equivalence Profinite.toCompHausEquivalence

/-- The connected_components functor from compact Hausdorff spaces to profinite spaces,
left adjoint to the inclusion functor.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/Basic/Variante45406e07a61260dc61fe16cf5cd9278f077b461dbd462d6dd2eddb1e92cbaa9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/Basic/Variante45406e07a61260dc61fe16cf5cd9278f077b461dbd462d6dd2eddb1e92cbaa9.lean#L201).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `33329dc29183a147bda5f16322814cd720709912` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
