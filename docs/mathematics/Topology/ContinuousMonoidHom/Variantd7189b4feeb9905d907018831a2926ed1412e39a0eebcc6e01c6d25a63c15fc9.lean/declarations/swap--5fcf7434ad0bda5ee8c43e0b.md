## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:76f74070d14eb11b1a344543f4c5986855ca6d0f91d2b99c6d58a279f6160ae3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 213–219.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def swap : (A × B) →ₜ* (B × A) := prod (snd A B) (fst A B)

section CommMonoid
variable [CommMonoid E] [TopologicalSpace E] [ContinuousMul E]

/-- The continuous homomorphism given by multiplication. -/
@[to_additive (attr := simps!) "The continuous homomorphism given by addition."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/ContinuousMonoidHom/Variantd7189b4feeb9905d907018831a2926ed1412e39a0eebcc6e01c6d25a63c15fc9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/ContinuousMonoidHom/Variantd7189b4feeb9905d907018831a2926ed1412e39a0eebcc6e01c6d25a63c15fc9.lean#L213).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9e7abbe2bc2b3b6e54145fdb8f069b21ae0f82d6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
