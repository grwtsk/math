## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c2b048fb-4e86-d449-e638-c90fa7049234`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 491–502.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem symm_comp_eq {α : Type*} (e : M ≃ₜ* N) (f : α → M) (g : α → N) :
    e.symm ∘ g = f ↔ g = e ∘ f :=
  e.toEquiv.symm_comp_eq f g

end symm

section trans

variable {L : Type*} [Mul L] [TopologicalSpace L]

/-- The composition of two ContinuousMulEquiv. -/
@[to_additive "The composition of two ContinuousAddEquiv."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/ContinuousMonoidHom/Variantdb636dc0559374b155214e7ad5c4e39d03fb64caa5cf787de0c0cf6cdb742696.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/ContinuousMonoidHom/Variantdb636dc0559374b155214e7ad5c4e39d03fb64caa5cf787de0c0cf6cdb742696.lean#L491).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
