## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:23033f3b-4d1a-6bd4-27e9-5302d7ff86e4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 76–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem component_atoms_are_connected_and_faithful {α : Type*} [TopologicalSpace α]
    (f : α → ℝ) (x : α) :
    IsPreconnected (Function.support (componentAtom f x)) ∧
      Function.support (componentAtom f x) ⊆ Function.support f := by
  rw [component_atom_exact_support]
  exact ⟨isPreconnected_connectedComponentIn, connectedComponentIn_subset _ _⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/NodalPanelMinimality/Variantcbf69987faab15b7dd9ada1317d22979c672588bd4209685443dc4d8af9fd3a9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/NodalPanelMinimality/Variantcbf69987faab15b7dd9ada1317d22979c672588bd4209685443dc4d8af9fd3a9.lean#L76).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f3ee510ea6c745e2b55c5921d7f85b055fba8521` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
