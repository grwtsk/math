## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:678483a3-9330-fd4e-3f6f-a290201fbb64`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 252–266.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem b_start_endpoint_connected (k : ℕ) (h : Handle k) :
    BoundaryConnected k
      (originalCornerPoint k (h, 1))
      (originalCornerPoint k (nextHandle k h, 0)) := by
  have p : BoundaryConnected k
      ((h, 1), (0 : unitInterval))
      ((h, 3), (1 : unitInterval)) := by
    simpa using (Relation.EqvGen.rel _ _
      (BoundaryGluingStep.pairB h (0 : unitInterval)))
  exact Relation.EqvGen.trans _ _ _ p (Relation.EqvGen.rel _ _
    (BoundaryGluingStep.seamNext h))

/-- Every ACTUAL finite direct corner-pairing from #834 is a
CONSEQUENCE of the more primitive topological interval pairings.
No corner identification is silently added as a new axiom. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/SurfacePolygonBoundaryTopology.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/SurfacePolygonBoundaryTopology.lean#L252).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4d0f5d976ef27da7df26ee01540a2bee36c01c8e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
