## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5287f95601cd640572b362f1a5901404f3df320b048d14ee82be4524bdaf17ad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 76–85.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def homotopicMapsNatIso (H : ContinuousMap.Homotopy f g) : map f ⟶ map g where
  app x := ⟦H.evalAt x.as⟧
  naturality := by
    rintro ⟨x⟩ ⟨y⟩ p
    rcases Path.Homotopic.Quotient.mk_surjective p with ⟨p, rfl⟩
    simp only [map_map, Path.Homotopic.Quotient.mk''_eq_mk, comp_eq,
      ← Path.Homotopic.Quotient.mk_map, ← Path.Homotopic.Quotient.mk_trans]
    rw [Path.Homotopic.Quotient.eq]
    exact .map_trans_evalAt _ _

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/InducedMaps/Variant15dff5a1eb0fb22dab2f28263c5b20b12a0c0a58fa010e295beeda4713aed280.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/InducedMaps/Variant15dff5a1eb0fb22dab2f28263c5b20b12a0c0a58fa010e295beeda4713aed280.lean#L76).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f8f221fb4dc2dba0001fd7b22fce06af72d14316` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
