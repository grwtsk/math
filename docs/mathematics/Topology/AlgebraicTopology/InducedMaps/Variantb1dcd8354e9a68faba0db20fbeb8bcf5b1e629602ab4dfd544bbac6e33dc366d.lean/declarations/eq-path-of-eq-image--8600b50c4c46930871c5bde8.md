## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6e37314e-9f32-5b90-b0dc-7e0d57eb6ed5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–204.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

-- We let `X` and `Y` be spaces, and `f` and `g` be homotopic maps between them
variable {X Y : TopCat.{u}} {f g : C(X, Y)} (H : ContinuousMap.Homotopy f g) {x₀ x₁ : X}
  (p : fromTop x₀ ⟶ fromTop x₁)

/-!
These definitions set up the following diagram, for each path `p`:

```
            f(p)
        *--------*
        | \      |
    H₀  |   \ d  |  H₁
        |     \  |
        *--------*
            g(p)
```

Here, `H₀ = H.evalAt x₀` is the path from `f(x₀)` to `g(x₀)`,
and similarly for `H₁`. Similarly, `f(p)` denotes the
path in Y that the induced map `f` takes `p`, and similarly for `g(p)`.

Finally, `d`, the diagonal path, is H(0 ⟶ 1, p), the result of the induced `H` on
`Path.Homotopic.prod (0 ⟶ 1) p`, where `(0 ⟶ 1)` denotes the path from `0` to `1` in `I`.

It is clear that the diagram commutes (`H₀ ≫ g(p) = d = f(p) ≫ H₁`), but unfortunately,
many of the paths do not have defeq starting/ending points, so we end up needing some casting.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/InducedMaps/Variantb1dcd8354e9a68faba0db20fbeb8bcf5b1e629602ab4dfd544bbac6e33dc366d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/InducedMaps/Variantb1dcd8354e9a68faba0db20fbeb8bcf5b1e629602ab4dfd544bbac6e33dc366d.lean#L164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `293583c0136be647b00b520209c95076e78bfd01` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
