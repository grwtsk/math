## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1742a862b18b79d2faf3f7a68d5cc047ff3fb5973ee6a75eb7971adeca4dfdf1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 74–88.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def uhpath01 : @fromTop (TopCat.of <| ULift.{u} I) (ULift.up (0 : I)) ⟶ fromTop (ULift.up 1) :=
  ⟦upath01⟧
#align unit_interval.uhpath01 unitInterval.uhpath01

end unitInterval

namespace ContinuousMap.Homotopy

open unitInterval (uhpath01)

attribute [local instance] Path.Homotopic.setoid

section Casts

/-- Abbreviation for `eqToHom` that accepts points in a topological space -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/InducedMaps/Variantbe1f63d0e0a42ae60eb2d4fcc9ba6394e1f72bf302b0a084da2b780af24c76d8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/InducedMaps/Variantbe1f63d0e0a42ae60eb2d4fcc9ba6394e1f72bf302b0a084da2b780af24c76d8.lean#L74).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `49a237b4cede0ee0e7c24f97693e7805ede89786` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
