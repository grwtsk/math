## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:25cb84cdfb281da6c781a5cf630eef3cc2959a560483785738986924ffaea2d7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 283–303.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [IsCofibrant A] (P P' : Cylinder A) [P.IsGood] [P'.IsGood] :
    (P.trans P').IsGood where
  cofibration_i := by
    let ψ : P.I ⨿ A ⟶ (P.trans P').I := coprod.desc (pushout.inl _ _) (P'.i₁ ≫ pushout.inr _ _)
    rw [show (P.trans P').i = coprod.map P.i₀ (𝟙 A) ≫ ψ by simp [Precylinder.i, ψ]]
    have fac : coprod.map P.i₁ (𝟙 A) ≫ ψ = P'.i ≫ pushout.inr _ _ := by
      ext
      · simp [ψ, pushout.condition]
      · simp [ψ]
    have sq : IsPushout P.i₁ (coprod.inl ≫ P'.i) (coprod.inl ≫ ψ) (pushout.inr _ _) := by
      simpa [ψ] using IsPushout.of_hasPushout P.i₁ P'.i₀
    have : Cofibration ψ := by
      rw [cofibration_iff]
      exact (cofibrations C).of_isPushout
        (IsPushout.of_top sq fac (IsPushout.of_coprod_inl_with_id P.i₁ A).flip)
        (by rw [← cofibration_iff]; infer_instance)
    infer_instance

end Cylinder

end HomotopicalAlgebra
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Cylinder/Variant87ea5f5745daeef0ca23d5835996c5b1c3513082a8228a7fa24a663606778792.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Cylinder/Variant87ea5f5745daeef0ca23d5835996c5b1c3513082a8228a7fa24a663606778792.lean#L283).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b25e4d249a347dccd21f35043353c9b6e71a9ff3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
