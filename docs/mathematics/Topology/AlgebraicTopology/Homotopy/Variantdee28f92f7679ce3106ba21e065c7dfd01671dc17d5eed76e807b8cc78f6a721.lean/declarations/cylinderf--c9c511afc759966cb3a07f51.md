## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fcf38d57ba2975ff7d11cc6e243f6f2a54818bda300f3def85bc0f58d93a8538`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 127–134.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev cylinderf {i : E.I₀} (k : F.I₁ (f.s₀ i) (g.s₀ i)) : cylinderX f g k ⟶ S :=
  pullback.fst _ _ ≫ E.f _

/-- Given two refinement morphisms `f, g : E ⟶ F`, this is a (pre-)`1`-hypercover `W` that
admits a morphism `h : W ⟶ E` such that `h ≫ f` and `h ≫ g` are homotopic. Hence
they become equal after quotienting out by homotopy.
This is a `1`-hypercover, if `E` and `F` are (see `OneHypercover.cylinder`). -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Homotopy/Variantdee28f92f7679ce3106ba21e065c7dfd01671dc17d5eed76e807b8cc78f6a721.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Homotopy/Variantdee28f92f7679ce3106ba21e065c7dfd01671dc17d5eed76e807b8cc78f6a721.lean#L127).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e3a1a1458883e1e8722ecefcbda6610a65933dcc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
