## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a673e3f37364e0770cb651cface39892cef4237636d6d6155ef3a6f99e6b4721`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 325–330.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def prodMap {f₀ f₁ : C(X, Y)} {g₀ g₁ : C(Z, Z')} (F : Homotopy f₀ f₁) (G : Homotopy g₀ g₁) :
    Homotopy (f₀.prodMap g₀) (f₁.prodMap g₁) :=
  .prodMk (.hcomp (.refl .fst) F) (.hcomp (.refl .snd) G)

/-- Given a family of homotopies `F i` between `f₀ i : C(X, Y i)` and `f₁ i : C(X, Y i)`, returns a
homotopy between `ContinuousMap.pi f₀` and `ContinuousMap.pi f₁`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Basic/Variant002bc459649bf04e36905df02015c350afe8b57e49b07c102f8a861d172c9bf6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Basic/Variant002bc459649bf04e36905df02015c350afe8b57e49b07c102f8a861d172c9bf6.lean#L325).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7e3f9222e06f847e83852c3483d9081672cf71c4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
