## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3845f3c6aeb12511bdf76604dfb4c4702132050c8296d8592c957353ed66eea2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 293–299.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def compContinuousMap {g₀ g₁ : C(Y, Z)} (G : Homotopy g₀ g₁) (f : C(X, Y)) :
    Homotopy (g₀.comp f) (g₁.comp f) :=
  G.comp (.refl f)

/-- Let `F` be a homotopy between `f₀ : C(X, Y)` and `f₁ : C(X, Y)`. Let `G` be a homotopy between
`g₀ : C(X, Z)` and `g₁ : C(X, Z)`. Then `F.prodMk G` is the homotopy between `f₀.prodMk g₀` and
`f₁.prodMk g₁` that sends `p` to `(F p, G p)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Basic/Variante983c30f4006516e0e300c887bee86d838abdcc1d8659362abf8d9324eaa912a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Basic/Variante983c30f4006516e0e300c887bee86d838abdcc1d8659362abf8d9324eaa912a.lean#L293).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f9dcf8fadd7028c7849734757a36d41581ec9b52` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
