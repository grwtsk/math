## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:57da08cbd7b503f8c0bc7db90d2ed1aeb1f5f7a09b6e274c9434fbe16c98e801`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 85–96.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Homotopy (f₀ f₁ : C(X, Y)) extends C(I × X, Y) where
  /-- value of the homotopy at 0 -/
  map_zero_left : ∀ x, toFun (0, x) = f₀ x
  /-- value of the homotopy at 1 -/
  map_one_left : ∀ x, toFun (1, x) = f₁ x

section

/-- `ContinuousMap.HomotopyLike F f₀ f₁` states that `F` is a type of homotopies between `f₀` and
`f₁`.

You should extend this class when you extend `ContinuousMap.Homotopy`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Basic/Variant1268a89a72a1d77df969a18dd6b42a54954f63ac13f0b7476dda58b2fd537e73.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Basic/Variant1268a89a72a1d77df969a18dd6b42a54954f63ac13f0b7476dda58b2fd537e73.lean#L85).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `facf33b9f1c51cfde5d40af4e3907cc82a9f8768` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
