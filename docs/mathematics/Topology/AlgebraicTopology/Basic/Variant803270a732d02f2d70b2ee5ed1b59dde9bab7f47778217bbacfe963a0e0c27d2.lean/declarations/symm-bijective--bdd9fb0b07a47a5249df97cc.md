## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1e44d00c-7292-c198-f6f2-ae5ab591aebd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 221–228.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem symm_bijective {f₀ f₁ : C(X, Y)} :
    Function.Bijective (Homotopy.symm : Homotopy f₀ f₁ → Homotopy f₁ f₀) :=
  Function.bijective_iff_has_inverse.mpr ⟨_, symm_symm, symm_symm⟩

/--
Given `Homotopy f₀ f₁` and `Homotopy f₁ f₂`, we can define a `Homotopy f₀ f₂` by putting the first
homotopy on `[0, 1/2]` and the second on `[1/2, 1]`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Basic/Variant803270a732d02f2d70b2ee5ed1b59dde9bab7f47778217bbacfe963a0e0c27d2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Basic/Variant803270a732d02f2d70b2ee5ed1b59dde9bab7f47778217bbacfe963a0e0c27d2.lean#L221).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7f60adcd576773c735b7ae34f34c7c8c1165ebe7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
