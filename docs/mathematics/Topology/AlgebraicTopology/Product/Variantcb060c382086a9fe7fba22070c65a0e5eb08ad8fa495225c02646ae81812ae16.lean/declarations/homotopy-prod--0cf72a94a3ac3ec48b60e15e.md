## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f568adacef8f2ec57725d6d73f862905879674d3159a0488ec27d9139f3809a2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 89–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Homotopy.prod (F : Homotopy f₀ f₁) (G : Homotopy g₀ g₁) :
    Homotopy (ContinuousMap.prodMk f₀ g₀) (ContinuousMap.prodMk f₁ g₁) where
  toFun t := (F t, G t)
  map_zero_left x := by simp only [prod_eval, Homotopy.apply_zero]
  map_one_left x := by simp only [prod_eval, Homotopy.apply_one]

/-- The relative product of homotopies `F` and `G`,
  where `F` takes `f₀` to `f₁` and `G` takes `g₀` to `g₁` -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Product/Variantcb060c382086a9fe7fba22070c65a0e5eb08ad8fa495225c02646ae81812ae16.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Product/Variantcb060c382086a9fe7fba22070c65a0e5eb08ad8fa495225c02646ae81812ae16.lean#L89).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `36b5fa2735105fc09d65b61c644b93defe67c67b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
