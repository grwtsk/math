## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:31dbb0eb408eee5f2bad2be7d2268fdbf4d69117892dc6315b10b9d84c8d3abd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 130–135.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def piHomotopy (γ₀ γ₁ : ∀ i, Path (as i) (bs i)) (H : ∀ i, Path.Homotopy (γ₀ i) (γ₁ i)) :
    Path.Homotopy (Path.pi γ₀) (Path.pi γ₁) :=
  ContinuousMap.HomotopyRel.pi H
#align path.homotopic.pi_homotopy Path.Homotopic.piHomotopy

/-- The product of a family of path homotopy classes. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Product/Variantaa66008e8699b159df6c3e1cda0322f286972cbc1a64586981a6a717e77e4293.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Product/Variantaa66008e8699b159df6c3e1cda0322f286972cbc1a64586981a6a717e77e4293.lean#L130).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9f3f92ffe6771c8d70acb23c76f94f015dcf7edc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
