## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:544d30b1-f7f4-c391-c702-d8165c513b1a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 180–189.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem symm_bijective {f₀ f₁ : X ⟶ Y} :
    Function.Bijective (Homotopy.symm : Homotopy f₀ f₁ → Homotopy f₁ f₀) :=
  Function.bijective_iff_has_inverse.mpr ⟨_, symm_symm, symm_symm⟩

set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency.types false in
/--
Given `Homotopy f₀ f₁` and `Homotopy f₁ f₂`, we can define a `Homotopy f₀ f₂` by
`TopCat.Homotopy.trans` on the first and second components.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/TopPair/Variant092f50e13dacc13ff79dad27d3d29a94e6763b37dad4c60889e0e76437edaaed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/TopPair/Variant092f50e13dacc13ff79dad27d3d29a94e6763b37dad4c60889e0e76437edaaed.lean#L180).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f059a383bf3f5c1c318d8c0cd013e49de406c272` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
