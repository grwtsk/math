## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f650ec99-b75c-fd48-4a1f-9e9550298668`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 328–333.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma ι₃_desc : ι₃ ≫ desc f₀ f₂ f₃ h₁₂ h₁₃ h₂₃ = f₃ := by
  rw [← cancel_epi (stdSimplex.faceSingletonComplIso.{u} 3).inv, ← Category.assoc,
    horn.faceSingletonComplIso_inv_ι]
  exact (horn.isColimit 1).fac _ (.right ⟨3, by simp⟩)

include h₁₂ h₁₃ h₂₃ in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/HornColimits/Variant8169ba80a49586b4c8b59f9b8aed08709cb71ad77bb6a04f325ef2ccd3119b94.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/HornColimits/Variant8169ba80a49586b4c8b59f9b8aed08709cb71ad77bb6a04f325ef2ccd3119b94.lean#L328).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e9acaa429e2253790b6b92d991b07e74ea0d316a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
