## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b3108aab-876d-bdbe-5623-9f3f981947a5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 125–136.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma subcomplex_hasDimensionLT_of_neq_top (h : A ≠ ⊤) :
    HasDimensionLT A n where
  degenerate_eq_top i hi := by
    ext ⟨a, ha⟩
    rw [A.mem_degenerate_iff]
    simp only [Set.top_eq_univ, Set.mem_univ, iff_true]
    obtain hi | rfl := hi.lt_or_eq
    · simp [Δ[n].degenerate_eq_univ_of_hasDimensionLT (n + 1) i]
    · rw [mem_degenerate_iff_notMem_nonDegenerate, nonDegenerate_top_dim]
      rintro rfl
      exact h (le_antisymm (by simp) (by simpa [← ofSimplex_objEquiv_symm_id]))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Boundary/Variantca56d30cf0e28bc1901173c020577b6e0bc7cf7863d2258f0c4027386f705a29.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Boundary/Variantca56d30cf0e28bc1901173c020577b6e0bc7cf7863d2258f0c4027386f705a29.lean#L125).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `491841dd56c58586a976996307814418718fd44a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
