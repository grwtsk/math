## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9ad0cbd8-aecb-6f87-fadb-220ef19c88d3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 137–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma le_boundary_iff :
    A ≤ boundary.{u} n ↔ A ≠ ⊤ := by
  refine ⟨fun h ↦ ?_, fun hA ↦ ?_⟩
  · rintro rfl
    exact lt_irrefl _ (lt_of_le_of_lt h (boundary_lt_top n))
  · have := subcomplex_hasDimensionLT_of_neq_top A hA
    rw [Subcomplex.le_iff_contains_nonDegenerate]
    rintro m ⟨x, h₁⟩ h₂
    dsimp at h₂ ⊢
    by_cases! h₃ : m < n
    · simp [boundary_obj_eq_univ m n h₃]
    · simp [← A.mem_nonDegenerate_iff ⟨x, h₂⟩,
        nonDegenerate_eq_empty_of_hasDimensionLT _ _ _ h₃] at h₁

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Boundary/Variantca56d30cf0e28bc1901173c020577b6e0bc7cf7863d2258f0c4027386f705a29.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Boundary/Variantca56d30cf0e28bc1901173c020577b6e0bc7cf7863d2258f0c4027386f705a29.lean#L137).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `491841dd56c58586a976996307814418718fd44a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
