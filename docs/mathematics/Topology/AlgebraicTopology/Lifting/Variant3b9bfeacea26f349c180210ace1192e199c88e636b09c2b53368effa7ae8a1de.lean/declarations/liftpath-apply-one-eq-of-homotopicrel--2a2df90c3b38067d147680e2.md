## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:81453155-3e85-7e86-3b02-53bab0d7c5d9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 388–396.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem liftPath_apply_one_eq_of_homotopicRel {γ₀ γ₁ : C(I, X)}
    (h : γ₀.HomotopicRel γ₁ {0,1}) (e : E) (h₀ : γ₀ 0 = p e) (h₁ : γ₁ 0 = p e) :
    cov.liftPath γ₀ e h₀ 1 = cov.liftPath γ₁ e h₁ 1 := by
  have := (cov.homotopicRel_liftPath h e h₀ h₁).some
  rw [← this.eq_fst 0 (.inr rfl), ← this.eq_snd 0 (.inr rfl)]

/-- The monodromy of a covering map `p : E → X`, which sends a lift of the starting point of a
  path in `X` to the endpoint of the lifted path in `E`. It only depends on the homotopy class
  of the path. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Lifting/Variant3b9bfeacea26f349c180210ace1192e199c88e636b09c2b53368effa7ae8a1de.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Lifting/Variant3b9bfeacea26f349c180210ace1192e199c88e636b09c2b53368effa7ae8a1de.lean#L388).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2fad44e72ce62dfc5ab7ea4fc07a469842e5b8fa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
