## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:683e4a7142e33ed840e3eebe886c87deeb7e833c1e040df7c48b046722255f7a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 229–236.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def liftHomotopyZeroZero {Y Z : C} {P : ProjectiveResolution Y} {Q : ProjectiveResolution Z}
    (f : P.complex ⟶ Q.complex) (comm : f ≫ Q.π = 0) : P.complex.X 0 ⟶ Q.complex.X 1 :=
  Exact.lift (f.f 0) (Q.complex.d 1 0) (Q.π.f 0) Q.exact₀
    (congr_fun (congr_arg HomologicalComplex.Hom.f comm) 0)
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false in
#align category_theory.ProjectiveResolution.lift_homotopy_zero_zero CategoryTheory.ProjectiveResolution.liftHomotopyZeroZero

/-- An auxiliary definition for `liftHomotopyZero`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/ProjectiveResolution/Variantce0c58043741df9725688403c9594faf4028a1f71bfcb8879b279b85ec53ca73.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/ProjectiveResolution/Variantce0c58043741df9725688403c9594faf4028a1f71bfcb8879b279b85ec53ca73.lean#L229).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ae16bb73f658f03d728903fd47fccf2649c84e6d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
