## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3e00f073a88b5c7a0cdf982d5944769e1ce2bbd72739bf43c2269dd0c1cdbd07`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def liftHomotopyZeroSucc {Y Z : C} {P : ProjectiveResolution Y} {Q : ProjectiveResolution Z}
    (f : P.complex ⟶ Q.complex) (n : ℕ) (g : P.complex.X n ⟶ Q.complex.X (n + 1))
    (g' : P.complex.X (n + 1) ⟶ Q.complex.X (n + 2))
    (w : f.f (n + 1) = P.complex.d (n + 1) n ≫ g + g' ≫ Q.complex.d (n + 2) (n + 1)) :
    P.complex.X (n + 2) ⟶ Q.complex.X (n + 3) :=
  (Q.exact_succ (n + 1)).liftFromProjective (f.f (n + 2) - P.complex.d _ _ ≫ g') (by simp [w])

@[reassoc (attr := simp)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Resolution/Variant7f5796ad9b8c62659e1fa294da887116be61b7c63581cdd8398ba8a35da4c153.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Resolution/Variant7f5796ad9b8c62659e1fa294da887116be61b7c63581cdd8398ba8a35da4c153.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b9701eb8ff5f044393296844860bc916020457c6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
