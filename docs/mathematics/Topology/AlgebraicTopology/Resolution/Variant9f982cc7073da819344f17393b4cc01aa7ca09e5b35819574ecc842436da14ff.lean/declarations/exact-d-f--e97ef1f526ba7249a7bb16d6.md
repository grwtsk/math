## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cda1f72c-f94a-befd-2880-3c64f7e18697`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 256–286.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

namespace ProjectiveResolution

/-!
Our goal is to define `ProjectiveResolution.of Z : ProjectiveResolution Z`.
The `0`-th object in this resolution will just be `Projective.over Z`,
i.e. an arbitrarily chosen projective object with a map to `Z`.
After that, we build the `n+1`-st object as `Projective.syzygies`
applied to the previously constructed morphism,
and the map from the `n`-th object as `Projective.d`.

-- The construction of the projective resolution `of` would be very, very slow

/-- Auxiliary definition for `ProjectiveResolution.of`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Resolution/Variant9f982cc7073da819344f17393b4cc01aa7ca09e5b35819574ecc842436da14ff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Resolution/Variant9f982cc7073da819344f17393b4cc01aa7ca09e5b35819574ecc842436da14ff.lean#L256).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7836ab35befa89fafebc496c65ad11911016cdeb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
