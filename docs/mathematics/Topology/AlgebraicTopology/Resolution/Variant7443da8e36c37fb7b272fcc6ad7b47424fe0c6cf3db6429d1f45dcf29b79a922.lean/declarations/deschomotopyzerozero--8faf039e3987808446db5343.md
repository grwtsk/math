## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:77622ed039ff5a7ed1e922e8dc9412be4943402f77de4c375459be43ba9e8d59`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–111.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def descHomotopyZeroZero {Y Z : C} {I : InjectiveResolution Y} {J : InjectiveResolution Z}
    (f : I.cocomplex ⟶ J.cocomplex) (comm : I.ι ≫ f = 0) : I.cocomplex.X 1 ⟶ J.cocomplex.X 0 :=
  I.exact₀.descToInjective (f.f 0) (congr_fun (congr_arg HomologicalComplex.Hom.f comm) 0)

@[reassoc (attr := simp)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Resolution/Variant7443da8e36c37fb7b272fcc6ad7b47424fe0c6cf3db6429d1f45dcf29b79a922.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Resolution/Variant7443da8e36c37fb7b272fcc6ad7b47424fe0c6cf3db6429d1f45dcf29b79a922.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `53d6753f1f508ffbe2c5450ff7de59e8e71ba6f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
