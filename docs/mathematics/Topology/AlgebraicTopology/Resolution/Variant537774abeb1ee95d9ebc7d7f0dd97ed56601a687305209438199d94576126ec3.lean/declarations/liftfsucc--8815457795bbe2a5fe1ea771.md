## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9eb58d14adc4a91360eabf00cd21e23f01de3da301967320c858ff5c5a8b41f8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 82–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def liftFSucc {Y Z : C} (P : ProjectiveResolution Y) (Q : ProjectiveResolution Z) (n : ℕ)
    (g : P.complex.X n ⟶ Q.complex.X n) (g' : P.complex.X (n + 1) ⟶ Q.complex.X (n + 1))
    (w : g' ≫ Q.complex.d (n + 1) n = P.complex.d (n + 1) n ≫ g) :
    Σ' g'' : P.complex.X (n + 2) ⟶ Q.complex.X (n + 2),
      g'' ≫ Q.complex.d (n + 2) (n + 1) = P.complex.d (n + 2) (n + 1) ≫ g' :=
  ⟨(Q.exact_succ n).liftFromProjective
    (P.complex.d (n + 2) (n + 1) ≫ g') (by simp [w]),
      (Q.exact_succ n).liftFromProjective_comp _ _⟩

/-- A morphism in `C` lifts to a chain map between projective resolutions. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Resolution/Variant537774abeb1ee95d9ebc7d7f0dd97ed56601a687305209438199d94576126ec3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Topology/AlgebraicTopology/Resolution/Variant537774abeb1ee95d9ebc7d7f0dd97ed56601a687305209438199d94576126ec3.lean#L82).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ca3148b0af5f0d56857fae42235e6bf1fa99b76f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
