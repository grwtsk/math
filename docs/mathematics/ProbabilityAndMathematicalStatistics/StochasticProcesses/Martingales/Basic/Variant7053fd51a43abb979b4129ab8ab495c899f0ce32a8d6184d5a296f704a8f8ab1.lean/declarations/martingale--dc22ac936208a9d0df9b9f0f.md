## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1ab88e7edcc13e0de22e0e8ded891bd77f322aaf01290bb4cf060932cc3e6016`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–63.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Martingale (f : ι → Ω → E) (ℱ : Filtration ι m0) (μ : Measure Ω) : Prop :=
  Adapted ℱ f ∧ ∀ i j, i ≤ j → μ[f j|ℱ i] =ᵐ[μ] f i

/-- A family of integrable functions `f : ι → Ω → E` is a supermartingale with respect to a
filtration `ℱ` if `f` is adapted with respect to `ℱ` and for all `i ≤ j`,
`μ[f j | ℱ.le i] ≤ᵐ[μ] f i`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/StochasticProcesses/Martingales/Basic/Variant7053fd51a43abb979b4129ab8ab495c899f0ce32a8d6184d5a296f704a8f8ab1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/StochasticProcesses/Martingales/Basic/Variant7053fd51a43abb979b4129ab8ab495c899f0ce32a8d6184d5a296f704a8f8ab1.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ea1b0afa81bb24d14de7568155f206e4b7b7dd9f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
