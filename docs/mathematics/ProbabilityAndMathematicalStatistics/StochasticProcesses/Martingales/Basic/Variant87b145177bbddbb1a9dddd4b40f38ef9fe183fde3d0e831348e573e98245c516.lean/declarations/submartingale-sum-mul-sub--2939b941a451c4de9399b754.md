## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cbf41fd0-a466-b77c-e3b5-dd144c378005`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 602–610.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Submartingale.sum_mul_sub [IsFiniteMeasure μ] {R : ℝ} {ξ f : ℕ → Ω → ℝ}
    (hf : Submartingale f 𝒢 μ) (hξ : StronglyAdapted 𝒢 ξ) (hbdd : ∀ n ω, ξ n ω ≤ R)
    (hnonneg : ∀ n ω, 0 ≤ ξ n ω) :
    Submartingale (fun n => ∑ k ∈ Finset.range n, ξ k * (f (k + 1) - f k)) 𝒢 μ :=
  hf.sum_smul_sub hξ hbdd hnonneg

/-- Given a discrete submartingale `f` and a predictable process `ξ` (i.e. `ξ (n + 1)` is strongly
adapted) the process defined by `fun n => ∑ k ∈ Finset.range n, ξ (k + 1) * (f (k + 1) - f k)` is
also a submartingale. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/StochasticProcesses/Martingales/Basic/Variant87b145177bbddbb1a9dddd4b40f38ef9fe183fde3d0e831348e573e98245c516.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/StochasticProcesses/Martingales/Basic/Variant87b145177bbddbb1a9dddd4b40f38ef9fe183fde3d0e831348e573e98245c516.lean#L602).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `479a8484ba70fd3cbc5341092c5479a3454b9dfb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
