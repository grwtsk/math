## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fee2a2d9-6d59-dcf7-081e-37abd4fe90b0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 684–718.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Variant of the upcrossing estimate

Now, we would like to prove a variant of the upcrossing estimate obtained by taking the supremum
over $N$ of the original upcrossing estimate. Namely, we want the inequality
$$
  (b - a) \sup_N \mathbb{E}[U_N(a, b)] \le \sup_N \mathbb{E}[f_N].
$$
This inequality is central for the martingale convergence theorem as it provides a uniform bound
for the upcrossings.

We note that on top of taking the supremum on both sides of the inequality, we had also used
the monotone convergence theorem on the left hand side to take the supremum outside of the
integral. To do this, we need to make sure $U_N(a, b)$ is measurable and integrable. Integrability
is easy to check as $U_N(a, b) ≤ N$ and so it suffices to show measurability. Indeed, by
noting that
$$
  U_N(a, b) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \mathbf{1}_{\{U_N(a, b) < N\}}
$$
$U_N(a, b)$ is measurable as $\{U_N(a, b) < N\}$ is a measurable set since $U_N(a, b)$ is a
stopping time.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/StochasticProcesses/Martingales/Upcrossing/Variant3ef021f88be71abcaf3f2c8d6363ec695787828b61e2c8f0653c9b97dcd26d68.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/StochasticProcesses/Martingales/Upcrossing/Variant3ef021f88be71abcaf3f2c8d6363ec695787828b61e2c8f0653c9b97dcd26d68.lean#L684).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fcfc514f5551f7c467d8b2e758743a902e8bbf6e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
