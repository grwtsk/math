## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:62d706f3-17d7-67a4-694c-18125b090c24`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 141–149.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem upcrossings_eq_top_of_frequently_lt (hab : a < b) (h₁ : ∃ᶠ n in atTop, f n ω < a)
    (h₂ : ∃ᶠ n in atTop, b < f n ω) : upcrossings a b f ω = ∞ :=
  by_contradiction fun h => not_frequently_of_upcrossings_lt_top hab h ⟨h₁, h₂⟩

/-- A realization of a stochastic process with bounded upcrossings and bounded limit inferiors is
convergent.

We use the spelling `< ∞` instead of the standard `≠ ∞` in the assumptions since it is not as easy
to change `<` to `≠` under binders. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/StochasticProcesses/Martingales/Convergence/Variant530bdead48975d6edea0b8b8b20239bb0e53baa3eadb81467cfe2c5ae9ec3125.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/StochasticProcesses/Martingales/Convergence/Variant530bdead48975d6edea0b8b8b20239bb0e53baa3eadb81467cfe2c5ae9ec3125.lean#L141).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `238d5ecb63710a9b1c7893e86411c34b930ad73c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
