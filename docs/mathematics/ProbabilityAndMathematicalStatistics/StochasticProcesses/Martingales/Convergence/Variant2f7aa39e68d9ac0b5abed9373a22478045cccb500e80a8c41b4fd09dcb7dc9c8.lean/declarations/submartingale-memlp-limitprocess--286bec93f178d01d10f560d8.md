## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c48eba52-4164-803a-b0c1-ca522b7790da`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 238–318.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### L¹ martingale convergence theorem

We will now prove the L¹ martingale convergence theorems.

The L¹ martingale convergence theorem states that:
(a) if `f` is a uniformly integrable (in the probability sense) submartingale adapted to the
  filtration `ℱ`, it converges in L¹ to an integrable function `g` which is measurable with
  respect to `ℱ∞ := ⨆ n, ℱ n` and
(b) if `f` is actually a martingale, `f n = 𝔼[g | ℱ n]` almost everywhere.
(c) Finally, if `h` is integrable and measurable with respect to `ℱ∞`, `(𝔼[h | ℱ n])ₙ` is a
  uniformly integrable martingale which converges to `h` almost everywhere and in L¹.

The proof is quite simple. (a) follows directly from the a.e. martingale convergence theorem
and the Vitali convergence theorem as our definition of uniform integrability (in the probability
sense) directly implies L¹-uniform boundedness. We note that our definition of uniform
integrability is slightly non-standard but is equivalent to the usual literary definition. This
equivalence is provided by `MeasureTheory.uniformIntegrable_iff`.

(b) follows since given $n$, we have for all $m \ge n$,
$$
  \|f_n - \mathbb{E}[g \mid \mathcal{F}_n]\|_1 =
    \|\mathbb{E}[f_m - g \mid \mathcal{F}_n]\|_1 \le \|\|f_m - g\|_1.
$$
Thus, taking $m \to \infty$ provides the almost everywhere equality.

Finally, to prove (c), we define $f_n := \mathbb{E}[h \mid \mathcal{F}_n]$. It is clear that
$(f_n)_n$ is a martingale by the tower property for conditional expectations. Furthermore,
$(f_n)_n$ is uniformly integrable in the probability sense. Indeed, as a single function is
uniformly integrable in the measure theory sense, for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists some
$\delta > 0$ such that for all measurable set $A$ with $\mu(A) < δ$, we have
$\mathbb{E}|h|\mathbf{1}_A < \epsilon$. So, since for sufficiently large $\lambda$, by the Markov
inequality, we have for all $n$,
$$
  \mu(|f_n| \ge \lambda) \le \lambda^{-1}\mathbb{E}|f_n| \le \lambda^{-1}\mathbb|g| < \delta,
$$
we have for sufficiently large $\lambda$, for all $n$,
$$
  \mathbb{E}|f_n|\mathbf{1}_{|f_n| \ge \lambda} \le
    \mathbb|g|\mathbf{1}_{|f_n| \ge \lambda} < \epsilon,
$$
implying $(f_n)_n$ is uniformly integrable. Now, to prove $f_n \to h$ almost everywhere and in
L¹, it suffices to show that $h = g$ almost everywhere where $g$ is the almost everywhere and L¹
limit of $(f_n)_n$ from part (b) of the theorem. By noting that, for all $s \in \mathcal{F}_n$,
we have
$$
  \mathbb{E}g\mathbf{1}_s = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[g \mid \mathcal{F}_n]\mathbf{1}_s] =
    \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[h \mid \mathcal{F}_n]\mathbf{1}_s] = \mathbb{E}h\mathbf{1}_s
$$
where $\mathbb{E}[g \mid \mathcal{F}_n = \mathbb{E}[h \mid \mathcal{F}_n]$ almost everywhere
by part (b); the equality also holds for all $s \in \mathcal{F}_\infty$ by Dynkin's theorem.
Thus, as both $h$ and $g$ are $\mathcal{F}_\infty$-measurable, $h = g$ almost everywhere as
required.

Similar to the a.e. martingale convergence theorem, rather than showing the existence of the
limiting process, we phrase the L¹-martingale convergence theorem by proving that a submartingale
does converge in L¹ to its `limitProcess`. However, in contrast to the a.e. martingale convergence
theorem, we do not need to introduce an L¹ version of `Filtration.limitProcess` as the L¹ limit
and the a.e. limit of a submartingale coincide.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/StochasticProcesses/Martingales/Convergence/Variant2f7aa39e68d9ac0b5abed9373a22478045cccb500e80a8c41b4fd09dcb7dc9c8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.
