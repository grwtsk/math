## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ee00446b-4830-de89-50af-b909e06c76f3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 182–228.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Lévy's generalization of the Borel-Cantelli lemma

Lévy's generalization of the Borel-Cantelli lemma states that: given a natural number indexed
filtration $(\mathcal{F}_n)$, and a sequence of sets $(s_n)$ such that for all
$n$, $s_n \in \mathcal{F}_n$, $limsup_n s_n$ is almost everywhere equal to the set for which
$\sum_n \mathbb{P}[s_n \mid \mathcal{F}_n] = \infty$.

The proof strategy follows by constructing a martingale satisfying the one sided martingale bound.
In particular, we define
$$
  f_n := \sum_{k < n} \mathbf{1}_{s_{n + 1}} - \mathbb{P}[s_{n + 1} \mid \mathcal{F}_n].
$$
Then, as a martingale is both a sub and a super-martingale, the set for which it is unbounded from
above must agree with the set for which it is unbounded from below almost everywhere. Thus, it
can only converge to $\pm \infty$ with probability 0. Thus, by considering
$$
  \limsup_n s_n = \{\sum_n \mathbf{1}_{s_n} = \infty\}
$$
almost everywhere, the result follows.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/StochasticProcesses/Martingales/BorelCantelli/Variantbd227a7b1c7b90153c013e269fdcb7da1be88847c397f21cf3069ddac6094a82.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/StochasticProcesses/Martingales/BorelCantelli/Variantbd227a7b1c7b90153c013e269fdcb7da1be88847c397f21cf3069ddac6094a82.lean#L182).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
