## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b64a2a0d-a401-9082-b4f3-6e30fbce64cb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 256–262.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem martingalePart_process_ae_eq (ℱ : Filtration ℕ m0) (μ : Measure Ω) (s : ℕ → Set Ω) (n : ℕ) :
    martingalePart (process s) ℱ μ n =
      ∑ k ∈ Finset.range n, ((s (k + 1)).indicator 1 - μ[(s (k + 1)).indicator 1 | ℱ k]) := by
  simp only [martingalePart_eq_sum, process_zero, zero_add]
  refine Finset.sum_congr rfl fun k _ => ?_
  simp only [process, Finset.sum_range_succ_sub_sum]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/StochasticProcesses/Martingales/BorelCantelli/Variant03489151320b65bfee8d32a80e6192cc8e9d5ba855c24e014ea810d31768b892.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/StochasticProcesses/Martingales/BorelCantelli/Variant03489151320b65bfee8d32a80e6192cc8e9d5ba855c24e014ea810d31768b892.lean#L256).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5a82be970be94326018b7b5192b6ace59da9bbe0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
