## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5f954f6d-3afd-58b6-fcca-9f411790b017`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 292–296.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem adapted_process (hs : ∀ n, MeasurableSet[ℱ n] (s n)) : Adapted ℱ (process s) := fun _ =>
  Finset.stronglyMeasurable_sum' _ fun _ hk =>
    stronglyMeasurable_one.indicator <| ℱ.mono (Finset.mem_range.1 hk) _ <| hs _
#align measure_theory.borel_cantelli.adapted_process MeasureTheory.BorelCantelli.adapted_process

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/StochasticProcesses/Martingales/BorelCantelli/Variantac1df3e0fc1b42c6f0f1c1be41066c1ec87a2d193ba48987683d2a34721e11e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/StochasticProcesses/Martingales/BorelCantelli/Variantac1df3e0fc1b42c6f0f1c1be41066c1ec87a2d193ba48987683d2a34721e11e7.lean#L292).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
