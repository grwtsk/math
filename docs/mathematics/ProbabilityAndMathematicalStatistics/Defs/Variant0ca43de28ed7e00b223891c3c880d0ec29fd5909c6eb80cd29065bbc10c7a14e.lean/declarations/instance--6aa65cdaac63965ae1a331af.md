## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:385a440524b37cf385ae853a530fcde8b1b83cbf52017c99eba2140ffb8c291d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 72–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : IsProbabilityMeasure G(V, p) := by
  refine measurableEmbedding_edgeSet.isProbabilityMeasure_comap ?_
  filter_upwards [setBernoulli_ae_subset] with s hs
  refine ⟨.fromEdgeSet s, ?_⟩
  simpa [← Set.disjoint_compl_right_iff_subset, ← Set.compl_ofPred] using hs

variable (V) in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/Defs/Variant0ca43de28ed7e00b223891c3c880d0ec29fd5909c6eb80cd29065bbc10c7a14e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/Defs/Variant0ca43de28ed7e00b223891c3c880d0ec29fd5909c6eb80cd29065bbc10c7a14e.lean#L72).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `96732967a25ac0797fe8104aee5468a5a7804b03` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
