## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:22175f4f-b072-d4e5-f277-2a7150cbd803`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 159–175.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma setBernoulli_empty : setBer((∅ : Set ι), p) = dirac ∅ := by
  ext s hs
  rw [setBernoulli_apply_eq_apply_subsets]
  by_cases h : ∅ ∈ s
  · have : {t | t ∈ s ∧ t ⊆ ∅} = {∅} := by grind
    simp_all
  · have : {t | t ∈ s ∧ t ⊆ ∅} = ∅ := by grind
    rw [this]
    simp_all

end Countable

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/SetBernoulli/Variant35f1d176786ea02b2f1b30bad12f662bef29064a5f72901b0dc90a9e7beb7681.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/SetBernoulli/Variant35f1d176786ea02b2f1b30bad12f662bef29064a5f72901b0dc90a9e7beb7681.lean#L159).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `54a018682f2c53eed414aaad9e201d1a140fef27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
