## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f94680e6-6309-8e5e-f4a0-b08be3822243`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 180–186.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem derivative_shift {n : Nat} (H : Bits n → Bits n)
    (δ x : Bits n) :
    derivative H δ (xorBits x δ) = derivative H δ x := by
  simp only [derivative, xorBits_cancel_self_right]
  exact xorBits_comm _ _

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/Avalanche/Variant2daf0a291e93848b59aba38d1e0a57d241ab03debf127cfd1940f157c39952fa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/Avalanche/Variant2daf0a291e93848b59aba38d1e0a57d241ab03debf127cfd1940f157c39952fa.lean#L180).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2d00ee9c03cd9f493f70e5c4d08c5ded99110181` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
