## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:574a7f3f-01ba-8f3e-e5d3-a0e6486753ec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 481–492.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem bias_sum_le {n : Nat} (H : Bits n → Bits n) :
    (∑ i : Fin n, ∑ j : Fin n, |2 * sacEntry H i j - 1|) ≤
      ((n * n : Nat) : ℚ) := by
  calc
    (∑ i : Fin n, ∑ j : Fin n, |2 * sacEntry H i j - 1|) ≤
        ∑ i : Fin n, ∑ _j : Fin n, (1 : ℚ) := by
          exact Finset.sum_le_sum fun i _ =>
            Finset.sum_le_sum fun j _ =>
              abs_two_mul_sub_one_le_one
                (sacEntry_nonneg H i j) (sacEntry_le_one H i j)
    _ = ((n * n : Nat) : ℚ) := by simp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/Avalanche/Variantc6cc028f62d333ffe4f9c75a7718cc2f6a3e469d992a84506b6fec9708d163f7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/Avalanche/Variantc6cc028f62d333ffe4f9c75a7718cc2f6a3e469d992a84506b6fec9708d163f7.lean#L481).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c839a015cb6d2e047ab5061b171d39f78d52370c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
