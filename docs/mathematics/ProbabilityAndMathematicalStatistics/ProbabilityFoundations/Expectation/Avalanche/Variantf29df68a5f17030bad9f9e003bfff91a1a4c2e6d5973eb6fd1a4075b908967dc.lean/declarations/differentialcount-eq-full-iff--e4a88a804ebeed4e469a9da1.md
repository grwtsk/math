## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:71c1d3ec-5a5f-3b1b-85dc-6615791705ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 237–248.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem differentialCount_eq_full_iff {n : Nat} (H : Bits n → Bits n)
    (δ γ : Bits n) :
    differentialCount H δ γ = 2 ^ n ↔
      ∀ x, derivative H δ x = γ := by
  classical
  rw [differentialCount, ← card_bits n, ← Finset.card_univ]
  simpa using
    (Finset.card_filter_eq_iff
      (s := (Finset.univ : Finset (Bits n)))
      (p := fun x => derivative H δ x = γ))

/-- Probability one is exactly the deterministic differential corridor condition. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/Avalanche/Variantf29df68a5f17030bad9f9e003bfff91a1a4c2e6d5973eb6fd1a4075b908967dc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/Avalanche/Variantf29df68a5f17030bad9f9e003bfff91a1a4c2e6d5973eb6fd1a4075b908967dc.lean#L237).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c38b8f794c2018a4bc6c55e3fb5214c32de20cd4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
