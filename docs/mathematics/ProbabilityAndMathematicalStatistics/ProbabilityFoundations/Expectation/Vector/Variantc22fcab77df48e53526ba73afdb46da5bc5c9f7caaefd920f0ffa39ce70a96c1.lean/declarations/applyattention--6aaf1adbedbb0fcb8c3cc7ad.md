## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c04cd5366fb42d46b4a0def04d8c00d924a72c73a053a94378e05415f595df1d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 197–214.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def applyAttention (weights : AffineVector) (V : List AffineVector) : AffineVector :=
  if V.isEmpty then []
  else
    let d_v := V.head!.length
    -- Initialize with zeros
    let zero := List.replicate d_v AffineForm.zero
    -- Weighted sum
    let weighted := List.zipWith (fun w v_row =>
      v_row.map (AffineForm.scale w.c0)  -- Simplified: use center value
    ) weights V
    weighted.foldl add zero

/-! ## GELU -/

/-- GELU activation: x · Φ(x) ≈ 0.5 · x · (1 + tanh(√(2/π) · (x + 0.044715 · x³)))

    Using affine arithmetic preserves correlations in x · tanh(f(x)).

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/Vector/Variantc22fcab77df48e53526ba73afdb46da5bc5c9f7caaefd920f0ffa39ce70a96c1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/Vector/Variantc22fcab77df48e53526ba73afdb46da5bc5c9f7caaefd920f0ffa39ce70a96c1.lean#L197).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f23ce61f8848de0853a45d35af011df66345fb58` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
