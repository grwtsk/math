## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:664278c9-5ebe-fda8-34da-df3902672be7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 151–160.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ofReal_variance [IsFiniteMeasure μ] (hX : MemLp X 2 μ) :
    .ofReal (variance X μ) = evariance X μ := by
  rw [variance, ENNReal.ofReal_toReal]
  exact evariance_ne_top hX

protected alias _root_.MeasureTheory.MemLp.evariance_lt_top := evariance_lt_top
protected alias _root_.MeasureTheory.MemLp.evariance_ne_top := evariance_ne_top
protected alias _root_.MeasureTheory.MemLp.ofReal_variance_eq := ofReal_variance

variable (X μ) in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/Variance/Variant4bcf6b093579b5bc971df1ce24006a8ef51200c8ccdbefddfc0770c796dcfbb7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/Variance/Variant4bcf6b093579b5bc971df1ce24006a8ef51200c8ccdbefddfc0770c796dcfbb7.lean#L151).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8fb44c5e58fff94c17d9eba7503219c9a0c8b0a1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
