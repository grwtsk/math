## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2e817d4b-f59e-50ff-3ca2-cc03beba0eb0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 591–611.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma integrable_exp_mul (h : HasCondSubgaussianMGF m hm X c μ) (t : ℝ) :
    Integrable (fun ω ↦ exp (t * X ω)) μ :=
  condExpKernel_comp_trim (μ := μ) hm ▸ Kernel.HasSubgaussianMGF.integrable_exp_mul h t

end HasCondSubgaussianMGF

end Conditional

/-! ### Sub-Gaussian moment-generating function -/

variable {Ω : Type*} {m mΩ : MeasurableSpace Ω} {μ : Measure Ω} {X : Ω → ℝ} {c : ℝ≥0}

/-- A random variable `X` has a sub-Gaussian moment-generating function with parameter `c`
with respect to a measure `μ` if for all `t : ℝ`, `exp (t * X)` is `μ`-integrable and
the moment-generating function of `X` is bounded by `exp (c * t ^ 2 / 2)` for all `t : ℝ`.
This implies in particular that `X` has expectation 0.

This is equivalent to `Kernel.HasSubgaussianMGF X c (Kernel.const Unit μ) (Measure.dirac ())`,
as proved in `HasSubgaussianMGF_iff_kernel`.
Properties about sub-Gaussian moment-generating functions should be proved first for
`Kernel.HasSubgaussianMGF` when possible. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/SubGaussian/Variant155d73ea56b5b11c2061fea8b29ff7944b9670e53d495e9f64db679eef32676e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/SubGaussian/Variant155d73ea56b5b11c2061fea8b29ff7944b9670e53d495e9f64db679eef32676e.lean#L591).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0392f56ed0dce14393aa269b42c8ddc86d59f0e2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
