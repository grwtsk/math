## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a176c8df-f31f-de7d-ead6-8a5f18dde252`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 293–298.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem const_div [Div γ] [MeasurableDiv γ] (h : IdentDistrib f g μ ν) (c : γ) :
    IdentDistrib (fun x => c / f x) (fun x => c / g x) μ ν :=
  h.comp (MeasurableDiv.measurable_const_div c)
#align probability_theory.ident_distrib.const_div ProbabilityTheory.IdentDistrib.const_div
#align probability_theory.ident_distrib.const_sub ProbabilityTheory.IdentDistrib.const_sub

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/IdentDistrib/Variant8c1c489ce9c35ad12f7ba1155ac3a0070d7736a95d4cd3cd9c9bbb109faf9853.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/IdentDistrib/Variant8c1c489ce9c35ad12f7ba1155ac3a0070d7736a95d4cd3cd9c9bbb109faf9853.lean#L293).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a344d23c2b3d886fa04ad862a338cab90b98fa07` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
