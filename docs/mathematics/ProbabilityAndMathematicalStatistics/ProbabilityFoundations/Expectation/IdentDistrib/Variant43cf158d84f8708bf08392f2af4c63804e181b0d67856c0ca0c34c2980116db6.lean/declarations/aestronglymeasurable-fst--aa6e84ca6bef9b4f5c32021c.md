## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b9f4a3e7-2a0c-3e33-cdce-c50bd137782e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 147–152.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem aestronglyMeasurable_fst [TopologicalSpace γ] [MetrizableSpace γ] [OpensMeasurableSpace γ]
    [SecondCountableTopology γ] (h : IdentDistrib f g μ ν) : AEStronglyMeasurable f μ :=
  h.aemeasurable_fst.aestronglyMeasurable
#align probability_theory.ident_distrib.ae_strongly_measurable_fst ProbabilityTheory.IdentDistrib.aestronglyMeasurable_fst

/-- If `f` and `g` are identically distributed and `f` is a.e. strongly measurable, so is `g`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/IdentDistrib/Variant43cf158d84f8708bf08392f2af4c63804e181b0d67856c0ca0c34c2980116db6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/IdentDistrib/Variant43cf158d84f8708bf08392f2af4c63804e181b0d67856c0ca0c34c2980116db6.lean#L147).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a5fa8e12c8473a7c4a35bdad80423e933fb810d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
