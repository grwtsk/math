## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:90f3bb39-cc24-815d-9302-b3adfe5c6d8d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 123–131.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measure_mem_eq (h : IdentDistrib f g μ ν) {s : Set γ} (hs : MeasurableSet s) :
    μ (f ⁻¹' s) = ν (g ⁻¹' s) := by
  rw [← Measure.map_apply_of_aemeasurable h.aemeasurable_fst hs, ←
    Measure.map_apply_of_aemeasurable h.aemeasurable_snd hs, h.map_eq]
#align probability_theory.ident_distrib.measure_mem_eq ProbabilityTheory.IdentDistrib.measure_mem_eq

alias measure_preimage_eq := measure_mem_eq
#align probability_theory.ident_distrib.measure_preimage_eq ProbabilityTheory.IdentDistrib.measure_preimage_eq

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/IdentDistrib/Variant43cf158d84f8708bf08392f2af4c63804e181b0d67856c0ca0c34c2980116db6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/IdentDistrib/Variant43cf158d84f8708bf08392f2af4c63804e181b0d67856c0ca0c34c2980116db6.lean#L123).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a5fa8e12c8473a7c4a35bdad80423e933fb810d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
