## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4bef419803e4473e564fa3080ec6d87311a8087e75aded3963e05c01ff190770`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 167–204.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance instCompleteLattice : CompleteLattice (Filtration ι m) where
  le := (· ≤ ·)
  le_refl _ _ := le_rfl
  le_trans _ _ _ h_fg h_gh i := (h_fg i).trans (h_gh i)
  le_antisymm _ _ h_fg h_gf := Filtration.ext <| funext fun i => (h_fg i).antisymm (h_gf i)
  sup := (· ⊔ ·)
  le_sup_left _ _ _ := le_sup_left
  le_sup_right _ _ _ := le_sup_right
  sup_le _ _ _ h_fh h_gh i := sup_le (h_fh i) (h_gh _)
  inf := (· ⊓ ·)
  inf_le_left _ _ _ := inf_le_left
  inf_le_right _ _ _ := inf_le_right
  le_inf _ _ _ h_fg h_fh i := le_inf (h_fg i) (h_fh i)
  sSup := sSup
  le_sSup _ f hf_mem _ := le_sSup ⟨f, hf_mem, rfl⟩
  sSup_le s f h_forall i :=
    sSup_le fun m' hm' => by

      rw [← hfm']

    have hs : s.Nonempty := ⟨f, hf_mem⟩

    exact fun g hg_mem => h_forall g hg_mem i
  top := ⊤
  bot := ⊥
  le_top f i := f.le' i
  bot_le _ _ := bot_le

end Filtration

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/Filtration/Variant44a895daf85439142b4223bee040d51663551a454de93adeaa0dd50c0f1efd13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/Filtration/Variant44a895daf85439142b4223bee040d51663551a454de93adeaa0dd50c0f1efd13.lean#L167).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9f45749d3fc89b982da163f5915bbbdf22be1ee9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
