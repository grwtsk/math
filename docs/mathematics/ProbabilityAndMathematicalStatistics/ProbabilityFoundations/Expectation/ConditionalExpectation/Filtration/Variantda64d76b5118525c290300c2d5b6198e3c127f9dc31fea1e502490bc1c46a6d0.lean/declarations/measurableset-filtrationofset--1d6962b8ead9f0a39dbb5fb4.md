## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d6b514d1-dd2f-a6a1-b9f9-192d2b3e149c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 247–297.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Given a filtration `𝓕`, its **right continuation** is the filtration `𝓕₊` defined as follows:
- If `i` is isolated on the right, then `𝓕₊ i := 𝓕 i`;
- Otherwise, `𝓕₊ i := ⨅ j > i, 𝓕 j`.

It is sometimes simply defined as `𝓕₊ i := ⨅ j > i, 𝓕 j` when the index type is `ℝ`. In the
general case this is not ideal however. If `i` is maximal for instance, then `𝓕₊ i = ⊤`, which
is inconvenient because `𝓕₊` is not a `Filtration ι m` anymore. If the index type
is discrete (such as `ℕ`), then we would have `𝓕 = 𝓕₊` (i.e. `𝓕` is right-continuous) only if
`𝓕` is constant.

To avoid requiring a `TopologicalSpace` instance on `ι` in the definition, we endow `ι` with
the order topology `Preorder.topology` inside the definition. Say you write a statement about
`𝓕₊` which does not require a `TopologicalSpace` structure on `ι`,
but you wish to use a statement which requires a topology (such as `rightCont_apply`).
Then you can endow `ι` with the order topology by writing
```lean
  letI := Preorder.topology ι
  haveI : OrderTopology ι := ⟨rfl⟩
``` -/
noncomputable irreducible_def rightCont [PartialOrder ι] (𝓕 : Filtration ι m) : Filtration ι m :=
  letI : TopologicalSpace ι := Preorder.topology ι

      · exact 𝓕.le i }

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/Filtration/Variantda64d76b5118525c290300c2d5b6198e3c127f9dc31fea1e502490bc1c46a6d0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
