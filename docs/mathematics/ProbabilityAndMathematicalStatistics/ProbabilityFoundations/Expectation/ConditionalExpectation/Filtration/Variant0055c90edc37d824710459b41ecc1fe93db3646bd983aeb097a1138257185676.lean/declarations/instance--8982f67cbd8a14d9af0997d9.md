## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:af4c13b3a603bc25c3b8461434c0c43249e7cbed48458f86685ee41815a3f1ad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 143–161.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance : InfSet (Filtration ι m) :=
  ⟨fun s =>
    { seq := fun i => if Set.Nonempty s then sInf ((fun f : Filtration ι m => f i) '' s) else m
      mono' := fun i j hij => by
        by_cases h_nonempty : Set.Nonempty s
        swap; · simp only [h_nonempty, ite_false, le_refl]
        simp only [h_nonempty, ite_true, le_sInf_iff, Set.mem_image, forall_exists_index, and_imp,
          forall_apply_eq_imp_iff₂]
        refine fun f hf_mem => le_trans ?_ (f.mono hij)
        have hfi_mem : f i ∈ (fun g : Filtration ι m => g i) '' s := ⟨f, hf_mem, rfl⟩
        exact sInf_le hfi_mem
      le' := fun i => by
        by_cases h_nonempty : Set.Nonempty s
        swap; · simp only [h_nonempty, ite_false, le_refl]
        simp only [h_nonempty, ite_true]
        obtain ⟨f, hf_mem⟩ := h_nonempty
        exact le_trans (sInf_le ⟨f, hf_mem, rfl⟩) (f.le i) }⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/Filtration/Variant0055c90edc37d824710459b41ecc1fe93db3646bd983aeb097a1138257185676.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/Filtration/Variant0055c90edc37d824710459b41ecc1fe93db3646bd983aeb097a1138257185676.lean#L143).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ad86d6c454e2d1dd7d3bc5e4a41877be9b6fe9ab` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
