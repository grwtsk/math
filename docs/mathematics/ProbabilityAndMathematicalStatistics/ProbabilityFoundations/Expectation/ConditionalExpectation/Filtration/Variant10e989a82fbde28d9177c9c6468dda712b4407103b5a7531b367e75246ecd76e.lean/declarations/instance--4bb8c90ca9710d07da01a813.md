## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9e129cbc78025a8146a9784017277f391d12709d199891f021f8c0fd2047d68f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 123–140.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : SupSet (Filtration ι m) :=
  ⟨fun s =>
    { seq := fun i => sSup ((fun f : Filtration ι m => f i) '' s)
      mono' := fun i j hij => by
        refine' sSup_le fun m' hm' => _
        rw [Set.mem_image] at hm'
        obtain ⟨f, hf_mem, hfm'⟩ := hm'
        rw [← hfm']
        refine' (f.mono hij).trans _
        have hfj_mem : f j ∈ (fun g : Filtration ι m => g j) '' s := ⟨f, hf_mem, rfl⟩
        exact le_sSup hfj_mem
      le' := fun i => by
        refine' sSup_le fun m' hm' => _
        rw [Set.mem_image] at hm'
        obtain ⟨f, _, hfm'⟩ := hm'
        rw [← hfm']
        exact f.le i }⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/Filtration/Variant10e989a82fbde28d9177c9c6468dda712b4407103b5a7531b367e75246ecd76e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/Filtration/Variant10e989a82fbde28d9177c9c6468dda712b4407103b5a7531b367e75246ecd76e.lean#L123).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d56f65c1c3d6a2f363858e7ab2b8b7da2fe3ea28` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
