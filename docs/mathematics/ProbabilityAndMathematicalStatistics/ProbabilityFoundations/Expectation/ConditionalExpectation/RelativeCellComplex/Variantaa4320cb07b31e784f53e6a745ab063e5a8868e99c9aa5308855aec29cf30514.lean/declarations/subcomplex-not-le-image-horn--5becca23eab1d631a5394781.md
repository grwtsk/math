## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:70c12d4b-3cdd-7169-0cc1-e85328a18124`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–110.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma subcomplex_not_le_image_horn : ¬ c.s.val.subcomplex ≤ c.horn.image c.map := by
  intro h
  simp only [Subfunctor.ofSection_le_iff, image_obj, Set.mem_image] at h
  obtain ⟨x, h₁, h₂⟩ := h
  obtain ⟨g, rfl⟩ := stdSimplex.objEquiv.symm.surjective x
  rw [← stdSimplex.map_objEquiv_op_apply, Equiv.apply_symm_apply] at h₂
  have := mono_of_nonDegenerate (x := ⟨_, c.s.val.nonDegenerate⟩) _ _ _ h₂
  obtain rfl := (P.isUniquelyCodimOneFace c.s).unique rfl _ h₂
  rw [← ofSimplex_le_iff, subcomplex_le_horn_iff, ← stdSimplex.face_singleton_compl] at h₁

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/RelativeCellComplex/Variantaa4320cb07b31e784f53e6a745ab063e5a8868e99c9aa5308855aec29cf30514.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/RelativeCellComplex/Variantaa4320cb07b31e784f53e6a745ab063e5a8868e99c9aa5308855aec29cf30514.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c3c794563aaafa9d6e5e487aca9722e9cd217f1e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
