## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f6809d03-c857-6eae-31df-783532c12eff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–161.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma filtration_monotone : Monotone f.filtration := by
  intro i₁ i₂ h
  conv_lhs => rw [filtration_def]
  simp only [sup_le_iff, iSup_le_iff, le_filtration, true_and]
  intro j hj c
  exact f.subcomplex_le_filtration c (lt_of_lt_of_le hj h)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/RelativeCellComplex/Variantaa4320cb07b31e784f53e6a745ab063e5a8868e99c9aa5308855aec29cf30514.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/RelativeCellComplex/Variantaa4320cb07b31e784f53e6a745ab063e5a8868e99c9aa5308855aec29cf30514.lean#L155).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
