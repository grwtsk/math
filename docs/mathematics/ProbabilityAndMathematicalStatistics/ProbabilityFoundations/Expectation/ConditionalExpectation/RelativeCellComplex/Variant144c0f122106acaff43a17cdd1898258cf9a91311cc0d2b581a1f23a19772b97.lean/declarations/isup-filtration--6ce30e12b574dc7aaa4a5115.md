## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9bce1a48-a840-f827-9d6f-ad32b6e1eee2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 213–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma iSup_filtration [OrderBot ι] [SuccOrder ι] [NoMaxOrder ι] :
    ⨆ (i : ι), f.filtration i = ⊤ := by
  refine le_antisymm (by simp) ?_
  rw [N.subcomplex_le_iff]
  intro s _
  cases s using SSet.Subcomplex.N.cases A with
  | mem s hs => exact hs.trans (le_trans (by simp) (le_iSup _ ⊥))
  | notMem s =>

    refine le_trans ?_
      (le_trans (f.subcomplex_le_filtration ⟨t, rfl⟩ (Order.lt_succ _)) (le_iSup _ _))
    obtain rfl | rfl := ht
    · exact P.le t
    · rfl

variable {f} in
/-- The morphism `Δ[c.dim + 1] ⟶ f.filtration (Order.succ j)` given
by `c : f.Cell j`, when `f` is a rank function for a proper pairing
of a subcomplex of a simplicial set. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/RelativeCellComplex/Variant144c0f122106acaff43a17cdd1898258cf9a91311cc0d2b581a1f23a19772b97.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/RelativeCellComplex/Variant144c0f122106acaff43a17cdd1898258cf9a91311cc0d2b581a1f23a19772b97.lean#L213).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `73179262d2625f5abf16a2c0f2bb57a46866097b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
