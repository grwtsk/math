## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:835fd03d-df2b-8bbe-be03-4338478f7fb4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 122–135.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem setIntegral_abs_condExp_le {s : Set α} (hs : MeasurableSet[m] s) (f : α → E) :
    ∫ x in s, |μ[f | m] x| ∂μ ≤ ∫ x in s, |f x| ∂μ := by
  by_cases! hm : ¬ m ≤ m0
  · simpa [condExp_of_not_le hm] using integral_nonneg (fun x => abs_nonneg f x)
  by_cases! hfint : ¬ Integrable f μ
  · simpa [condExp_of_not_integrable hfint] using integral_nonneg (fun x => abs_nonneg f x)
  by_cases! hsig : ¬ SigmaFinite (μ.trim hm)
  · simpa [condExp_of_not_sigmaFinite hm hsig] using integral_nonneg (fun x => abs_nonneg f x)
  calc
  _ = ∫ x in s, |(μ.restrict s)[f | m] x| ∂μ :=
    (integral_congr_ae ((condExp_restrict_ae_eq_restrict hm hs hfint).fun_comp abs)).symm
  _  ≤ _ := integral_abs_condExp_le f

/-- Note that this is not trivial as we don't assume that `f` is integrable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/Real/Varianta4b7569027222428eeb16f9e573ed55ae49f6b0a60ba58e0b6d3db922c5c8921.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/Real/Varianta4b7569027222428eeb16f9e573ed55ae49f6b0a60ba58e0b6d3db922c5c8921.lean#L122).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2faccd3760ea9e89ba12318c38af1e476d192eff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
