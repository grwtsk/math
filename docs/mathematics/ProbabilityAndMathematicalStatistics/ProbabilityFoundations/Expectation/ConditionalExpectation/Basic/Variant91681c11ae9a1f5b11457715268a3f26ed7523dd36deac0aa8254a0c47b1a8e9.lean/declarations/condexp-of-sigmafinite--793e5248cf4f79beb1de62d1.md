## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a4c1ea49-5e0e-7b62-8aee-bd09858b106e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 142–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem condExp_of_sigmaFinite (hm : m ≤ m₀) [hμm : SigmaFinite (μ.trim hm)] :
    μ[f | m] =
      if Integrable f μ then
        if StronglyMeasurable[m] f then f
        else aestronglyMeasurable_condExpL1.mk (condExpL1 hm μ f)
      else 0 := by
  rw [condExp, dite_eq_left hm]
  grind

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/Basic/Variant91681c11ae9a1f5b11457715268a3f26ed7523dd36deac0aa8254a0c47b1a8e9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/Basic/Variant91681c11ae9a1f5b11457715268a3f26ed7523dd36deac0aa8254a0c47b1a8e9.lean#L142).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2e0dba011dacd639f000caf31a3683da6da1c30e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
