## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d1152e4a-eb02-7dfa-458f-102f2bdb21d4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 253–258.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem condExp_mul_of_stronglyMeasurable_left {f g : Ω → ℝ} (hf : StronglyMeasurable[m] f)
    (hfg : Integrable (f * g) μ) (hg : Integrable g μ) : μ[f * g | m] =ᵐ[μ] f * μ[g | m] :=
  condExp_bilin_of_aestronglyMeasurable_left (.mul ℝ ℝ)
    hf.aestronglyMeasurable hfg hg

/-- Pull-out property of the conditional expectation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/PullOut/Variantb8923262888e6ddbed450045b356fa687c21720d3d660ee3d9ef6230b92e03b1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/ConditionalExpectation/PullOut/Variantb8923262888e6ddbed450045b356fa687c21720d3d660ee3d9ef6230b92e03b1.lean#L253).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ce9732219aad38850f6376c8baed04bfb9f2ddf2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
