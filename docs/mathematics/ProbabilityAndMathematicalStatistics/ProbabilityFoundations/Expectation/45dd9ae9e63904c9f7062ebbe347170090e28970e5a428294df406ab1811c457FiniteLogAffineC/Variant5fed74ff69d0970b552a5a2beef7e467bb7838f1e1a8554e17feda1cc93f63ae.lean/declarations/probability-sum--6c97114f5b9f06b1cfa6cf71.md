## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1a787c65-360b-8c39-1fae-4d6f8c1b2710`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem probability_sum (theta : E) :
    ∑ i : I, F.probability theta i = 1 := by
  classical
  simp_rw [probability]
  rw [← Finset.sum_div]
  change F.partition theta / F.partition theta = 1
  exact div_self (ne_of_gt (F.partition_pos theta))

/-- The centroid covector of the sufficient statistics. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/45dd9ae9e63904c9f7062ebbe347170090e28970e5a428294df406ab1811c457FiniteLogAffineC/Variant5fed74ff69d0970b552a5a2beef7e467bb7838f1e1a8554e17feda1cc93f63ae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/45dd9ae9e63904c9f7062ebbe347170090e28970e5a428294df406ab1811c457FiniteLogAffineC/Variant5fed74ff69d0970b552a5a2beef7e467bb7838f1e1a8554e17feda1cc93f63ae.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e3603574d283ecf5050fe7e0e8cd83f642061c4e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
