## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3af5efe636824c33176ce9a3ebbc60a13c7b4f354b646311a5481e0ab91b21c6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure FiniteLogAffineFamily (I : Type u) (E : Type v)
    [Fintype I] [Nonempty I]
    [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E] where
  baseWeight : I → ℝ
  baseWeight_pos : ∀ i, 0 < baseWeight i
  statistic : I → (E →L[ℝ] ℝ)

namespace FiniteLogAffineFamily

variable (F : FiniteLogAffineFamily I E)

/-- Unnormalized log-affine weight. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/FiniteLogAffineCovariance/Variant7467f4ad1161495675c05f0293118f088ef3700ff13386c82ae94fffd00da773.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/FiniteLogAffineCovariance/Variant7467f4ad1161495675c05f0293118f088ef3700ff13386c82ae94fffd00da773.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `52c648599eb2f7d2b49dd78fe5c27169a13c91a9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
