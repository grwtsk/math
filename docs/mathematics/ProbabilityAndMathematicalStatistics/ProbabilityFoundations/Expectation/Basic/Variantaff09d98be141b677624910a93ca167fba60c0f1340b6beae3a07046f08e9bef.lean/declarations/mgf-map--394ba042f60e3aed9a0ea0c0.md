## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c44f7fed-de44-4252-5093-cb6417983822`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 206–210.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma mgf_map {Ω' : Type*} {mΩ' : MeasurableSpace Ω'} {μ : Measure Ω'} {Y : Ω' → Ω} {X : Ω → ℝ}
    (hY : AEMeasurable Y μ) {t : ℝ} (hX : AEStronglyMeasurable (fun ω ↦ exp (t * X ω)) (μ.map Y)) :
    mgf X (μ.map Y) t = mgf (X ∘ Y) μ t := by
  simp_rw [mgf, integral_map hY hX, Function.comp_apply]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/Basic/Variantaff09d98be141b677624910a93ca167fba60c0f1340b6beae3a07046f08e9bef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/Expectation/Basic/Variantaff09d98be141b677624910a93ca167fba60c0f1340b6beae3a07046f08e9bef.lean#L206).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2b83bf9f6135d20de6cace523778bdbd9c0bdf4e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
