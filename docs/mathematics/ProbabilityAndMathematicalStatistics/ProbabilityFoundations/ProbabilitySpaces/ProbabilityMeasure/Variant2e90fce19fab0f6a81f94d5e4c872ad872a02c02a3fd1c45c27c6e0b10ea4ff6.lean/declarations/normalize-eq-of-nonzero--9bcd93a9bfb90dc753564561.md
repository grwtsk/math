## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:82ecd1a0-b35f-db07-c535-265507821796`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 502–505.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem normalize_eq_of_nonzero (nonzero : μ ≠ 0) (s : Set Ω) : μ.normalize s = μ.mass⁻¹ * μ s := by
  simp only [μ.self_eq_mass_mul_normalize, μ.mass_nonzero_iff.mpr nonzero, inv_mul_cancel_left₀,
    Ne, not_false_iff]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/ProbabilityMeasure/Variant2e90fce19fab0f6a81f94d5e4c872ad872a02c02a3fd1c45c27c6e0b10ea4ff6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/ProbabilityMeasure/Variant2e90fce19fab0f6a81f94d5e4c872ad872a02c02a3fd1c45c27c6e0b10ea4ff6.lean#L502).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9dcd944ac71f1e139e8baba7e4dba96d2cdbf1eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
