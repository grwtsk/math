## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:de10297c-75d4-dff8-de72-57eef9fe0588`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 103–123.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma IsCondKernel.isMarkovKernel [MeasurableSingletonClass α] (hρ : ∀ a, ρ.fst {a} ≠ 0) :
    IsMarkovKernel ρCond := ⟨fun _ ↦ isProbabilityMeasure _ _ (hρ _)⟩

### Disintegration of kernels

This section provides a predicate for a kernel to disintegrate a kernel. It also proves that if `κ`
is an s-finite kernel from a countable `α` such that each measure `κ a` is disintegrated by some
kernel, then `κ` itself is disintegrated by a kernel, namely
`ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.condKernelCountable`.

variable (κ : Kernel α (β × Ω)) (κCond : Kernel (α × β) Ω)

/-! #### Predicate for a kernel to disintegrate a kernel -/

/-- A kernel `κCond` is a conditional kernel for a kernel `κ` if it disintegrates it in the sense
that `κ.fst ⊗ₖ κCond = κ`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Basic/Variant22b3751b204bfac9ef33c84e42240f1db405e383eb9445471aedb50d7bd126a3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Basic/Variant22b3751b204bfac9ef33c84e42240f1db405e383eb9445471aedb50d7bd126a3.lean#L103).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1cb06a703408783f07bcf0bf9f3b5526e9ce4c97` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
