## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:22b2a772-73d6-0afa-1c49-e02b05beb5db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 109–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma prob_compl_eq_one_sub₀ (h : NullMeasurableSet s μ) : μ sᶜ = 1 - μ s := by
  rw [measure_compl₀ h (measure_ne_top _ _), measure_univ]

/-- Note that this is not quite as useful as it looks because the measure takes values in `ℝ≥0∞`.
Thus the subtraction appearing is the truncated subtraction of `ℝ≥0∞`, rather than the
better-behaved subtraction of `ℝ`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Probability/Variant43c8907dbcf8e889dcc3c0c783afc0b0010525664328c8113478b8c9ecf312ab.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Probability/Variant43c8907dbcf8e889dcc3c0c783afc0b0010525664328c8113478b8c9ecf312ab.lean#L109).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `638a39783d1c19a8ead5033b773ca15fc49177f9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
