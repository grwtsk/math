## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:deebf3931504f0afc511ad643a46fe32e690818d8e813af7bb60dd4a56eb8497`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 211–222.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isZeroOrProbabilityMeasureSMul :
    IsZeroOrProbabilityMeasure ((μ univ)⁻¹ • μ) := by
  rcases eq_zero_or_neZero μ with rfl | h
  · rw [Measure.coe_zero, Pi.zero_apply, inv_zero, smul_zero]; infer_instance
  rcases eq_top_or_lt_top (μ univ) with h | h
  · rw [h, inv_top, zero_smul]; infer_instance
  have : IsFiniteMeasure μ := ⟨h⟩
  infer_instance

variable [IsZeroOrProbabilityMeasure μ] {p : α → Prop} {f : β → α}

variable (μ) in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Probability/Variant18f6f140b8eeed5dafb561aeeb80d8d8865b5e4f21ad6a9cba4ff112bc99314a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Probability/Variant18f6f140b8eeed5dafb561aeeb80d8d8865b5e4f21ad6a9cba4ff112bc99314a.lean#L211).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9098952d2a9c06faba83e59ffb391a107a98e7fd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
