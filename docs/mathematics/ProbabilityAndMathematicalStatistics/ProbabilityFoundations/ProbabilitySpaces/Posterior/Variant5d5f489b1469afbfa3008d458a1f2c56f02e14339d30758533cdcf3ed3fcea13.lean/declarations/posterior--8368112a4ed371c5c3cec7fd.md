## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a93a6dfe79751e45294942671302910fd0b476396704366c2798309b6c0a95ea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 78–85.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def posterior (κ : Kernel Ω 𝓧) (μ : Measure Ω) [IsFiniteMeasure μ] [IsFiniteKernel κ] :
    Kernel 𝓧 Ω :=
  ((μ ⊗ₘ κ).map Prod.swap).condKernel

/-- Posterior of the kernel `κ` with respect to the measure `μ`. -/
scoped[ProbabilityTheory] infix:arg "†" => ProbabilityTheory.posterior

/-- The posterior is a Markov kernel. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Posterior/Variant5d5f489b1469afbfa3008d458a1f2c56f02e14339d30758533cdcf3ed3fcea13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Posterior/Variant5d5f489b1469afbfa3008d458a1f2c56f02e14339d30758533cdcf3ed3fcea13.lean#L78).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9de3dc7f7fcc1d7562763981b97023360ea53889` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
