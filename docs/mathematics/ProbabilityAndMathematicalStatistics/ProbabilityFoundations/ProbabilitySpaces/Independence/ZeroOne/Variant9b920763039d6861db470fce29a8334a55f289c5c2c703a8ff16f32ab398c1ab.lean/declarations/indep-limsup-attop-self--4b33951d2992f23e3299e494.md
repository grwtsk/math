## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ceec6772-11ba-74e5-5183-d37ce7ef4d47`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 131–148.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- **Kolmogorov's 0-1 law** : any event in the tail σ-algebra of an independent sequence of
sub-σ-algebras has probability 0 or 1.
The tail σ-algebra `limsup s atTop` is the same as `⋂ n, ⋃ i ≥ n, s i`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/ZeroOne/Variant9b920763039d6861db470fce29a8334a55f289c5c2c703a8ff16f32ab398c1ab.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/ZeroOne/Variant9b920763039d6861db470fce29a8334a55f289c5c2c703a8ff16f32ab398c1ab.lean#L131).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1ce3a12be460d0eecbe3037fc59d88cf78e2db4f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
