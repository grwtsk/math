## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:419f158d51fe0ef1f3870d2be2ba1ac15cd09ca7f1f3cb1e5dda769c721467e1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 169–182.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive VerificationResult (Host EdgeId : Type*)
    [Fintype Host] [DecidableEq Host]
    [Fintype EdgeId] [DecidableEq EdgeId] where
  | admitted (value : AdmittedProposal Host EdgeId)
  | rejected (reason : ProposalRejection)

/-! ## Range-only raw conversion

The existing ingress normalizer additionally checks the normalized color sum.
The verifier must not use that helper at gate 10: otherwise a valid-range value
with a wrong sum would be misclassified as `channelOutOfRange` instead of
reaching the later `colorInvariantViolation` gate.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Transport/Variantafb62a6a73a2874fedc3c47a793bdb7a7d42f6a4f9b807d9d86d85ebf93915ab.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Transport/Variantafb62a6a73a2874fedc3c47a793bdb7a7d42f6a4f9b807d9d86d85ebf93915ab.lean#L169).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e2d1c73fc16413b2ce8880a21ab132bde217a813` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
