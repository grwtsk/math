## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2b37205a-4d83-675d-98ea-fa70d2b5c5ba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 30–40.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem weighted_average :
    unequalWeights.averaging varying = (fun _ _ => (3 : ℝ)) ∧
      unequalWeights.averaging varying ≠ (fun _ _ => (2 : ℝ)) := by
  constructor
  · exact unequal_average
  · rw [unequal_average]
    intro h
    have hvalue := congrFun (congrFun h ()) 0
    norm_num at hvalue

/-- Exact coordinates of the retained packet's residual. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/8b3f578db3beaeb6f57d760364855059dd526c5f7263685e62c3d4091915cc41FiniteAveragingF/Varianta7bfae2be6848bf1703c8aa4cd6065090a247fa2cd2b9a275b7466d5f151bec8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/8b3f578db3beaeb6f57d760364855059dd526c5f7263685e62c3d4091915cc41FiniteAveragingF/Varianta7bfae2be6848bf1703c8aa4cd6065090a247fa2cd2b9a275b7466d5f151bec8.lean#L30).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `86d2cbc8a566d3189690970d1bfe6cde341a5ad8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
