## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:488e6325-e21f-e250-7d31-db0f75e9db00`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 232–238.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IndepSets.bInter {s : ι → Set (Set Ω)} {s' : Set (Set Ω)} {_mΩ : MeasurableSpace Ω}
    {κ : kernel α Ω} {μ : Measure α} {u : Set ι} (h : ∃ n ∈ u, IndepSets (s n) s' κ μ) :
    IndepSets (⋂ n ∈ u, s n) s' κ μ := by
  intro t1 t2 ht1 ht2
  rcases h with ⟨n, hn, h⟩
  exact h t1 t2 (Set.biInter_subset_of_mem hn ht1) ht2

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Kernel/Variantc64b46d331f434eeae290d04d3d673a06d0fdd4aa5a1cb6223e3558e2404f8f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Kernel/Variantc64b46d331f434eeae290d04d3d673a06d0fdd4aa5a1cb6223e3558e2404f8f2.lean#L232).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6b11a3760d5a40fc5cb1c50b429ce8d65e150314` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
