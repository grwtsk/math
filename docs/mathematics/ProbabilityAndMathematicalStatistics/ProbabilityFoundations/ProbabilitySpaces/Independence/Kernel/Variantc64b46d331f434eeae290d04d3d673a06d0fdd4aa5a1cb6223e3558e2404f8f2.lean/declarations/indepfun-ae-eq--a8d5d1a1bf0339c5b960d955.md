## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:087ed513-dc9e-2984-bb4c-875f8279cba0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 724–732.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IndepFun.ae_eq {mβ : MeasurableSpace β} {f g f' g' : Ω → β} (hfg : IndepFun f g κ μ)
    (hf : ∀ᵐ a ∂μ, f =ᵐ[κ a] f') (hg : ∀ᵐ a ∂μ, g =ᵐ[κ a] g') :
    IndepFun f' g' κ μ := by
  rintro _ _ ⟨A, hA, rfl⟩ ⟨B, hB, rfl⟩
  filter_upwards [hf, hg, hfg _ _ ⟨_, hA, rfl⟩ ⟨_, hB, rfl⟩] with a hf' hg' hfg'
  have h1 : f ⁻¹' A =ᵐ[κ a] f' ⁻¹' A := hf'.fun_comp A
  have h2 : g ⁻¹' B =ᵐ[κ a] g' ⁻¹' B := hg'.fun_comp B
  rwa [← measure_congr h1, ← measure_congr h2, ← measure_congr (h1.inter h2)]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Kernel/Variantc64b46d331f434eeae290d04d3d673a06d0fdd4aa5a1cb6223e3558e2404f8f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Kernel/Variantc64b46d331f434eeae290d04d3d673a06d0fdd4aa5a1cb6223e3558e2404f8f2.lean#L724).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6b11a3760d5a40fc5cb1c50b429ce8d65e150314` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
