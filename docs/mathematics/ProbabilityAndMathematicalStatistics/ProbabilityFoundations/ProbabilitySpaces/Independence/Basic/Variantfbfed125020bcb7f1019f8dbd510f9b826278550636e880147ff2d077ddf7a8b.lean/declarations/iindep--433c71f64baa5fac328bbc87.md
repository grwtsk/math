## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:819d2aabdb5c6bf9d0b2444429b8eb1475ac747451d14d9fd19026a2ec72792c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 101–109.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def iIndep (m : ι → MeasurableSpace Ω) [MeasurableSpace Ω] (μ : Measure Ω := by volume_tac) :
    Prop :=
  kernel.iIndep m (kernel.const Unit μ) (Measure.dirac () : Measure Unit)
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false in
#align probability_theory.Indep ProbabilityTheory.iIndep

/-- Two measurable space structures (or σ-algebras) `m₁, m₂` are independent with respect to a
measure `μ` (defined on a third σ-algebra) if for any sets `t₁ ∈ m₁, t₂ ∈ m₂`,
`μ (t₁ ∩ t₂) = μ (t₁) * μ (t₂)` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Basic/Variantfbfed125020bcb7f1019f8dbd510f9b826278550636e880147ff2d077ddf7a8b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Basic/Variantfbfed125020bcb7f1019f8dbd510f9b826278550636e880147ff2d077ddf7a8b.lean#L101).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `671abecd96c1b4876285447fdf0a9fe826bdd396` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
