## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b090f2a4-405c-3c48-6102-ad4f4d4562e3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 131–146.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    [∀ i, MeasurableSpace (𝓧 i)] [MeasurableSpace 𝓨] {X : (i : S) → Ω → 𝓧 i}
    {Y : Ω → 𝓨} (hX : ∀ i, AEMeasurable (X i) (κ ∘ₘ P)) (hY : AEMeasurable Y (κ ∘ₘ P))
    (h : ∀ (I : Finset S), IndepFun (fun ω (i : I) ↦ X i ω) Y κ P) [IsZeroOrMarkovKernel κ] :

  exact fun i ↦ Measure.ae_ae_of_ae_comp (hX i).ae_eq_mk.symm

/-- A random variable $X$ is independent from a stochastic process $(Y_s)_{s \in S}$  if
for all $s_1, ..., s_p \in S$ the variable $Y$ is independent from the family
$(X_{s_1}, ..., X_{s_p})$. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Basic/Variant8ea490b808cf2d687d50a054943ecd8892d9d2541732cd5cc40f391530c45904.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Basic/Variant8ea490b808cf2d687d50a054943ecd8892d9d2541732cd5cc40f391530c45904.lean#L131).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2362a7c914b9f8a3015e4c5c2628628019deb82e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
