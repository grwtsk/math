## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a1245a43-84ac-371e-ea8d-b98f899afbc5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 607–613.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem indepFun_iff_indepSet_preimage {mβ : MeasurableSpace β} {mβ' : MeasurableSpace β'}
    [IsZeroOrProbabilityMeasure μ] (hf : Measurable f) (hg : Measurable g) :
    IndepFun f g μ ↔
      ∀ s t, MeasurableSet s → MeasurableSet t → IndepSet (f ⁻¹' s) (g ⁻¹' t) μ := by
  simp only [IndepFun, IndepSet, Kernel.indepFun_iff_indepSet_preimage hf hg, ae_dirac_eq,
    Filter.eventually_pure, Kernel.const_apply]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Basic/Variant269c90032d81e9495fd77a294a48fc65d5ff6fb1973fd8d9d1c4c6a949bb4454.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Basic/Variant269c90032d81e9495fd77a294a48fc65d5ff6fb1973fd8d9d1c4c6a949bb4454.lean#L607).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dd9f6056ca677b04410cddb6e833f2e207564ab7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
