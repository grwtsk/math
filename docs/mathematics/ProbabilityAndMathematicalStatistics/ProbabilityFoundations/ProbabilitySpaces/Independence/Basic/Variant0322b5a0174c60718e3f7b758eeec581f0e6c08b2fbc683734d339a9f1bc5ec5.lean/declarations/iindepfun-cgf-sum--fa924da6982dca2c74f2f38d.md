## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:767cf9a4-1388-d119-5b64-5ec596516e2b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 391–400.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem iIndepFun.cgf_sum₀ {X : ι → Ω → ℝ}
    (h_indep : iIndepFun X μ) (h_meas : ∀ i, AEMeasurable (X i) μ)
    {s : Finset ι} (h_int : ∀ i ∈ s, Integrable (fun ω => exp (t * X i ω)) μ) :
    cgf (∑ i ∈ s, X i) μ t = ∑ i ∈ s, cgf (X i) μ t := by
  have : IsProbabilityMeasure μ := h_indep.isProbabilityMeasure
  simp_rw [cgf]
  rw [← log_prod fun j hj => ?_]
  · rw [h_indep.mgf_sum₀ h_meas]
  · exact (mgf_pos (h_int j hj)).ne'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Basic/Variant0322b5a0174c60718e3f7b758eeec581f0e6c08b2fbc683734d339a9f1bc5ec5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Basic/Variant0322b5a0174c60718e3f7b758eeec581f0e6c08b2fbc683734d339a9f1bc5ec5.lean#L391).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9a701e09e3611df6e6c139606cc62b2397d2c20a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
