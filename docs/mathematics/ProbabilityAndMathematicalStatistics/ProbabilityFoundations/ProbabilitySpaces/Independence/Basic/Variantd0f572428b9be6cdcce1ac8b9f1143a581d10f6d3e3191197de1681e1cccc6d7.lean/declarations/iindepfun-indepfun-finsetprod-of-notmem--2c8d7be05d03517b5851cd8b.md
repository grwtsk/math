## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:031a661a-ea96-57d1-fca6-3d7ebc811daa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1001–1012.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma iIndepFun.indepFun_finsetProd_of_notMem (hf_Indep : iIndepFun f μ)
    (hf_meas : ∀ i, Measurable (f i)) {s : Finset ι} {i : ι} (hi : i ∉ s) :
    IndepFun (∏ j ∈ s, f j) (f i) μ :=
  Kernel.iIndepFun.indepFun_finsetProd_of_notMem hf_Indep hf_meas hi

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Basic/Variantd0f572428b9be6cdcce1ac8b9f1143a581d10f6d3e3191197de1681e1cccc6d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Basic/Variantd0f572428b9be6cdcce1ac8b9f1143a581d10f6d3e3191197de1681e1cccc6d7.lean#L1001).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `85ec99af5f0329fa116611e43c504dc386f66128` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
