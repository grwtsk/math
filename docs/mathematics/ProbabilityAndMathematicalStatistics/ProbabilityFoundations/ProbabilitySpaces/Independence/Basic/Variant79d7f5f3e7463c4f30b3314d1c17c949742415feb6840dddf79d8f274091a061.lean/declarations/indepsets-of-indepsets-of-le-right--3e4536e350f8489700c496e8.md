## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:975868f1-845c-6c52-1946-5433b33d9c75`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 366–370.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem indepSets_of_indepSets_of_le_right {s₁ s₂ s₃ : Set (Set Ω)}
    (h_indep : IndepSets s₁ s₂ μ) (h32 : s₃ ⊆ s₂) :
    IndepSets s₁ s₃ μ :=
  Kernel.indepSets_of_indepSets_of_le_right h_indep h32

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Basic/Variant79d7f5f3e7463c4f30b3314d1c17c949742415feb6840dddf79d8f274091a061.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Basic/Variant79d7f5f3e7463c4f30b3314d1c17c949742415feb6840dddf79d8f274091a061.lean#L366).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3f348954b4478a5a81be29aaff1bb761d4eb197b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
