## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:52ccbd34-9c78-3c15-5f8e-229f5c2aa210`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 123–132.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma iIndepFun_iff_hasLaw_Pi_infinitePi [IsProbabilityMeasure P] {μ : (i : ι) → Measure (𝓧 i)}
    (hX : ∀ i, HasLaw (X i) (μ i) P) (hm : AEMeasurable (fun ω i ↦ X i ω) P) :
    iIndepFun X P ↔ HasLaw (fun ω i ↦ X i ω) (infinitePi μ) P where
  mp h := h.hasLaw_infinitePi hX hm
  mpr h := by
    rw [iIndepFun_iff_map_fun_eq_infinitePi_map₀ hm, h.map_eq]
    simp_rw [fun i ↦ (hX i).map_eq]

/-- Given random variables `X i : Ω i → 𝓧 i`, they are independent when viewed as random
variables defined on the product space `Π i, Ω i`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/InfinitePi/Variant2039e6cfcd497cecfa76deb9e2bd9f4987c599bce3aa72ee94bc82e40ee75360.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/InfinitePi/Variant2039e6cfcd497cecfa76deb9e2bd9f4987c599bce3aa72ee94bc82e40ee75360.lean#L123).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6b5eecbb1a02572e83ab1891c92c24df4f92f720` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
