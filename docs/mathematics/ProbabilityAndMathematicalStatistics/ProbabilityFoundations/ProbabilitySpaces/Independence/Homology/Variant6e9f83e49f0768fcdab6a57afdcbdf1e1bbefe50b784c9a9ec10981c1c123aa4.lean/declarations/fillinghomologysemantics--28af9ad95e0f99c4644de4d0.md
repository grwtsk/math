## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:116c5ed0f74dfcbbba078b51da3eded33b0adb18f15f6229449b60ea605719ba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 50–66.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure FillingHomologySemantics
    (T : OrientedKnotFillingTheory.{u}) where
  FirstHomology : T.ClosedManifold → Type v
  HasCode : Type v → Option Nat → Prop
  manifoldCode : T.ClosedManifold → Option Nat
  manifold_code_represents_first_homology : ∀ M,
    HasCode (FirstHomology M) (manifoldCode M)
  filling_code : ∀ {K : T.Knot} (r : T.Slope K),
    manifoldCode (T.Filling K r) = fillingFirstHomologyCode T r
  oriented_homeomorphism_invariant : ∀ {M N : T.ClosedManifold},
    T.OrientedHomeomorphism M N → manifoldCode M = manifoldCode N

namespace FillingHomologySemantics

variable {T : OrientedKnotFillingTheory.{u}}

/-- Oriented-homeomorphic fillings have equal first-homology codes. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Homology/Variant6e9f83e49f0768fcdab6a57afdcbdf1e1bbefe50b784c9a9ec10981c1c123aa4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Homology/Variant6e9f83e49f0768fcdab6a57afdcbdf1e1bbefe50b784c9a9ec10981c1c123aa4.lean#L50).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `40f3445756099b99755163c4b0f42fd171c84298` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
