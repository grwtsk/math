## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c85a5020d5a187bae47e789d32bab6b3d3af810091c210b9e5cb9f34bc376e23`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 169–189.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def reverse
    {count : Nat} {left right : Equiv.Perm (Fin count)}
    (step : AdjacentSwapWitness left right) :
    AdjacentSwapWitness right left where
  lower := step.lower
  upper := step.upper
  consecutive := step.consecutive
  right_eq := by
    let swap := Equiv.swap step.lower step.upper
    change left = right * swap
    calc
      left = (left * swap) * swap := by simp [swap, mul_assoc]
      _ = right * swap := congrArg (fun order ↦ order * swap) step.right_eq.symm

end AdjacentSwapWitness

/--
A concrete Coxeter square for swaps at separated adjacent index pairs.
The index equations ensure the lower and upper routes perform the same two
generators in opposite orders; `separated` encodes distance greater than one.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/DisjointCommutation/Variant90406d0efd443954f691fb9dc7ff33fb996854aa505b350d6e74ac81c023bef5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/DisjointCommutation/Variant90406d0efd443954f691fb9dc7ff33fb996854aa505b350d6e74ac81c023bef5.lean#L169).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `788bb292b942216576cd9910f6dcc0a7c730f88a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
