## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4316ecd2-409e-f421-c21f-92a56241f4ce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 96–107.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem two_site_commutes
    {p q p' q' : Nat} {M : T.Manifold}
    (left : T.FramedEmbedding p q M)
    (right : T.FramedEmbedding p' q' M)
    (hleft : T.Disjoint left right)
    (hright : T.Disjoint right left) :
    T.RelBoundaryDiffeomorphic
      (T.surgery (D.transportAfter left right hleft))
      (T.surgery (D.transportAfter right left hright)) :=
  G.sound (D.swap left right hleft hright)

/-- The selected transported copy satisfies the concrete model's naturality predicate. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/DisjointCommutation/Variant90406d0efd443954f691fb9dc7ff33fb996854aa505b350d6e74ac81c023bef5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/DisjointCommutation/Variant90406d0efd443954f691fb9dc7ff33fb996854aa505b350d6e74ac81c023bef5.lean#L96).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `788bb292b942216576cd9910f6dcc0a7c730f88a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
