## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7472a0c3e459a8b9f0f33439d9e5f39626efbead20b6e8d35e3c3f372e583c3c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 267–287.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure OrderedDisjointExecution
    {T : SmoothFramedSurgeryTheory}
    {M : T.Manifold} {count : Nat}
    (family : FiniteDisjointFramedFamily T M count)
    (semantics : DisjointExecutionSemantics T family)
    (order : Equiv.Perm (Fin count)) where
  manifoldAt : Fin (count + 1) → T.Manifold
  initial_eq : manifoldAt ⟨0, Nat.zero_lt_succ count⟩ = M
  embeddingAt : (step : Fin count) →
    T.FramedEmbedding
      (family.p (order step)) (family.q (order step))
      (manifoldAt (executionStateIndex step))
  transported_from_source : ∀ step,
    semantics.TransportedCopy (order step)
      (family.embedding (order step)) (embeddingAt step)
  next_eq : ∀ step,
    manifoldAt (executionNextStateIndex step) = T.surgery (embeddingAt step)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/DisjointCommutation/Variant20fc3a00132322fe37a9b12048333096f21287a7ce8c08217c09320fe6d5a99f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/DisjointCommutation/Variant20fc3a00132322fe37a9b12048333096f21287a7ce8c08217c09320fe6d5a99f.lean#L267).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0d45d62ae6b2df5d11d53027dcbb1857423189dc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
