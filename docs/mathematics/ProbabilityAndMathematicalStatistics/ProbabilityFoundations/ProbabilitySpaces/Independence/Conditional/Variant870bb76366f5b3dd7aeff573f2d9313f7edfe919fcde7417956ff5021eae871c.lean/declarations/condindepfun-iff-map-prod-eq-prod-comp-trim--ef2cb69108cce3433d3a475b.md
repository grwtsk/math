## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b6bb0b04-d39c-1bdf-cc22-4cee162f9c77`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 807–821.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma condIndepFun_iff_map_prod_eq_prod_comp_trim
    {mβ : MeasurableSpace β} {mβ' : MeasurableSpace β'} (hf : Measurable f) (hg : Measurable g) :
    CondIndepFun m' hm' f g μ
      ↔ @Measure.map _ _ _ (m'.prod _) (fun ω ↦ (ω, f ω, g ω)) μ
        = (Kernel.id ×ₖ ((condExpKernel μ m').map f ×ₖ (condExpKernel μ m').map g))
          ∘ₘ μ.trim hm' := by
  rw [condIndepFun_iff_compProd_map_prod_eq_compProd_prod_map_map hf hg]

  · rw [Measure.compProd_map (by fun_prop), compProd_trim_condExpKernel]
    exact Measure.map_map (by fun_prop) ((measurable_id.mono le_rfl hm').prodMk measurable_id)
  · rw [Measure.compProd_eq_comp_prod]

/-- Two random variables `f, g` are conditionally independent given a third `k` iff the
joint distribution of `k, f, g` factors into a product of their conditional distributions
given `k`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Conditional/Variant870bb76366f5b3dd7aeff573f2d9313f7edfe919fcde7417956ff5021eae871c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Conditional/Variant870bb76366f5b3dd7aeff573f2d9313f7edfe919fcde7417956ff5021eae871c.lean#L807).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8943eee9b4e0db33c8e019ea8f2dfb1f805d1890` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
