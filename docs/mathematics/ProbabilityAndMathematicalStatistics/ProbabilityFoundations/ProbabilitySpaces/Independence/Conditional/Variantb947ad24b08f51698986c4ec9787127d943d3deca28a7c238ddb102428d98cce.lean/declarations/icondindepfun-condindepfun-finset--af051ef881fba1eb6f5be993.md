## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fa357ba5-a644-8a1f-eef0-2e8eb71e5339`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 727–732.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem iCondIndepFun.condIndepFun_finset {β : ι → Type*}
    {m : ∀ i, MeasurableSpace (β i)} {f : ∀ i, Ω → β i} (S T : Finset ι) (hST : Disjoint S T)
    (hf_Indep : iCondIndepFun m' hm' f μ) (hf_meas : ∀ i, Measurable (f i)) :
    CondIndepFun m' hm' (fun a (i : S) => f i a) (fun a (i : T) => f i a) μ :=
  Kernel.iIndepFun.indepFun_finset S T hST hf_Indep hf_meas

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Conditional/Variantb947ad24b08f51698986c4ec9787127d943d3deca28a7c238ddb102428d98cce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Conditional/Variantb947ad24b08f51698986c4ec9787127d943d3deca28a7c238ddb102428d98cce.lean#L727).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bba1f952f5c27b2c95bc2c9689fae0e7ad2ff3fd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
