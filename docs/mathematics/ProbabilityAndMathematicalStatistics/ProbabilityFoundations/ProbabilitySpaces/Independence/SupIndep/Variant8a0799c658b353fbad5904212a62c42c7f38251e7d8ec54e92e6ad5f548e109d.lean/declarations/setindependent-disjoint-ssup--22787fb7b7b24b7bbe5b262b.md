## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a4cac99a-3c26-de7e-aade-2c09e269eb12`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 331–347.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

#align complete_lattice.set_independent.disjoint_Sup CompleteLattice.SetIndependent.disjoint_sSup

/-- An independent indexed family of elements in a complete lattice is one in which every element
  is disjoint from the `iSup` of the rest.

  Example: an indexed family of non-zero elements in a
  vector space is linearly independent iff the indexed family of subspaces they generate is
  independent in this sense.

  Example: an indexed family of submodules of a module is independent in this sense if
  and only the natural map from the direct sum of the submodules to the module is injective. -/
-- Porting note: needed to use `_H`
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/SupIndep/Variant8a0799c658b353fbad5904212a62c42c7f38251e7d8ec54e92e6ad5f548e109d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/SupIndep/Variant8a0799c658b353fbad5904212a62c42c7f38251e7d8ec54e92e6ad5f548e109d.lean#L331).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f725cd9f73e9cc2af80959c45c6e4773c278e2d0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
