## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:25f4a8c6c34c135e28f27c4e009807d642fcae5ab75ac8eb384ffd0947fd4259`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 485–493.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def evaluate
    {State : Type u}
    {decomposition : FiniteDecomposition}
    {objective : SurgicalObjective State decomposition.Piece}
    (trace : ReductiveSiteSelectionTrace State decomposition objective)
    (_hints : ReductiveExecutionHints) : Finset decomposition.Piece :=
  trace.finalCandidates

/-- RED-10: runtime evaluation order cannot change the semantic result. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/ReductiveSelectionTrace/Variant34edc21b807e87908350a79b4e759a1cbd72177dd2656624b519a4db784bf0f7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/ReductiveSelectionTrace/Variant34edc21b807e87908350a79b4e759a1cbd72177dd2656624b519a4db784bf0f7.lean#L485).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `17bbe6245649677aa2e16a6d02e067ffb4ea18fc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
