## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:685c81cd-90d5-59a9-41c2-3592adf7997a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 675–681.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem indep_iSup_of_monotone [SemilatticeSup ι] {Ω} {m : ι → MeasurableSpace Ω}
    {m' m0 : MeasurableSpace Ω} {κ : Kernel α Ω} {μ : Measure α} [IsZeroOrMarkovKernel κ]
    (h_indep : ∀ i, Indep (m i) m' κ μ) (h_le : ∀ i, m i ≤ m0) (h_le' : m' ≤ m0)

    Indep (⨆ i, m i) m' κ μ :=
  indep_iSup_of_directed_le h_indep h_le h_le' (Monotone.directed_le hm)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Indep/Variantd9c3136790ec0274b717e74ad5c479ea93433bf32d1590aabf9561aabefb1ecc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/Indep/Variantd9c3136790ec0274b717e74ad5c479ea93433bf32d1590aabf9561aabefb1ecc.lean#L675).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `60e1c1d99577d0d05b70058457fdf179d3f01227` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
