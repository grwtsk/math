## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e012cf88-772e-22aa-3b3d-289a29ef8ca9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 249–257.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IndepFun.comp {mβ : MeasurableSpace β} {mβ' : MeasurableSpace β'}
    {mγ : MeasurableSpace γ} {mγ' : MeasurableSpace γ'} {φ : β → γ} {ψ : β' → γ'}
    (hfg : IndepFun f g κ μ) (hφ : Measurable φ) (hψ : Measurable ψ) :
    IndepFun (φ ∘ f) (ψ ∘ g) κ μ := by
  rintro _ _ ⟨A, hA, rfl⟩ ⟨B, hB, rfl⟩
  apply hfg
  · exact ⟨φ ⁻¹' A, hφ hA, Set.preimage_comp.symm⟩
  · exact ⟨ψ ⁻¹' B, hψ hB, Set.preimage_comp.symm⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/IndepFun/Variant5ec87c8603c6b829c9c935f62eaf3626080bf03872f39df4fef51e6f6b1a3990.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Independence/IndepFun/Variant5ec87c8603c6b829c9c935f62eaf3626080bf03872f39df4fef51e6f6b1a3990.lean#L249).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `428ee49d927019dc40db5400fd6c5c1aa80440c2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
