## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c3232253-f9a0-453e-cd11-55cfd46a2aa4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 387–400.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    ∃ rs : ℕ → ℝ,
      Tendsto rs atTop (𝓝 0) ∧ ∀ n, 0 < rs n ∧ μ (frontier (Metric.thickening (rs n) s)) = 0 := by
  rcases exists_seq_strictAnti_tendsto (0 : ℝ) with ⟨Rs, ⟨_, ⟨Rs_pos, Rs_lim⟩⟩⟩
  have obs := fun n : ℕ => exists_null_frontier_thickening μ s (Rs_pos n)
  refine ⟨fun n : ℕ => (obs n).choose, ⟨?_, ?_⟩⟩

  · exact fun n ↦ ⟨(obs n).choose_spec.1.1, (obs n).choose_spec.2⟩

/-- One implication of the portmanteau theorem:
Assuming that for all Borel sets E whose boundary ∂E carries no probability mass under a
candidate limit probability measure μ we have convergence of the measures μsᵢ(E) to μ(E),
then for all closed sets F we have the limsup condition limsup μsᵢ(F) ≤ μ(F). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Portmanteau/Variant4855ee4f403c2a0b75db34fadbd9a6f871e875f5680ad754d225fe28e9b04f92.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Portmanteau/Variant4855ee4f403c2a0b75db34fadbd9a6f871e875f5680ad754d225fe28e9b04f92.lean#L387).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `43fb3b36318342ccebfc328ef04127c70f6e2ea4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
