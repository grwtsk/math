## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:898032cb-0bde-895f-fdea-91c421ff4a8b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 589–599.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_of_forall_isOpen_le_liminf' {ι : Type*} {μ : ProbabilityMeasure Ω}
    {μs : ι → ProbabilityMeasure Ω} {L : Filter ι} [L.IsCountablyGenerated]
    (h_opens : ∀ G, IsOpen G → (μ : Measure Ω) G ≤ L.liminf (fun i ↦ (μs i : Measure Ω) G)) :
    L.Tendsto (fun i ↦ μs i) (𝓝 μ) := by
  apply Filter.tendsto_of_seq_tendsto fun u hu ↦ ?_
  apply tendsto_of_forall_isOpen_le_liminf_nat' fun G hG ↦ ?_
  exact (h_opens G hG).trans (liminf_le_liminf_of_le hu)

/-- One implication of the portmanteau theorem: if for all open sets `G` we have the liminf
condition `μ(G) ≤ liminf μsₙ(G)`, then the measures `μsₙ` converge weakly to the measure `μ`.
Formulated here for countably generated filters. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Portmanteau/Variantb340f946455e0f30cee6cb2e9d0345ef55ec59b887574223098c8d9c611da5b6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Portmanteau/Variantb340f946455e0f30cee6cb2e9d0345ef55ec59b887574223098c8d9c611da5b6.lean#L589).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cd4a6d1837c264488b6cefcf7402bf52a1549d8d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
