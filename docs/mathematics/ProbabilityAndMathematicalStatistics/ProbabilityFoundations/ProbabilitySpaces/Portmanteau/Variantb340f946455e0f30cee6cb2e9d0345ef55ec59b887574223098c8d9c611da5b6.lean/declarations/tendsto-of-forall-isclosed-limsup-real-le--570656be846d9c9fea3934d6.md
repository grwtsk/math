## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:31578f27-07d0-acc4-65bc-3ef9ee928869`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 656–662.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma tendsto_of_forall_isClosed_limsup_real_le' {L : Filter ι} [L.IsCountablyGenerated]
    (h : ∀ F : Set Ω, IsClosed F →
      limsup (fun i ↦ (μs i : Measure Ω).real F) L ≤ (μ : Measure Ω).real F) :
    Tendsto μs L (𝓝 μ) := tendsto_of_forall_isClosed_limsup_le (by simpa using h)

/-- A different version of the (C) → (T) implication of the portmanteau theorem:
If the set of measures is tight, a `limsup` inequality for compact sets implies weak convergence. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Portmanteau/Variantb340f946455e0f30cee6cb2e9d0345ef55ec59b887574223098c8d9c611da5b6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Portmanteau/Variantb340f946455e0f30cee6cb2e9d0345ef55ec59b887574223098c8d9c611da5b6.lean#L656).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cd4a6d1837c264488b6cefcf7402bf52a1549d8d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
