## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5e73edea-339c-704a-3412-70890b8cb565`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 168–203.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-! ### Portmanteau: limit of measures of Borel sets whose boundary carries no mass in the limit

In this section we prove that for a sequence of Borel probability measures on a topological space
and its candidate limit measure, either of the following equivalent conditions:

  (C) For any closed set F, the limsup of the measures of F under μs is at most
      the measure of F under μ, i.e., limsupᵢ μsᵢ(F) ≤ μ(F);
  (O) For any open set G, the liminf of the measures of G under μs is at least
      the measure of G under μ, i.e., μ(G) ≤ liminfᵢ μsᵢ(G).

implies that

  (B) For any Borel set B whose boundary carries no mass under μ, i.e. μ(∂B) = 0,
      the measures of B under μs tend to the measure of B under μ, i.e., limᵢ μsᵢ(B) = μ(B).

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Portmanteau/Varianta75e2c16d72e4c9022cce0d9fe66df8a5ba63c6ebe837147113bbda628ed9766.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Portmanteau/Varianta75e2c16d72e4c9022cce0d9fe66df8a5ba63c6ebe837147113bbda628ed9766.lean#L168).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `14bfefe7634f73bf560897022dc579d3b9efc875` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
