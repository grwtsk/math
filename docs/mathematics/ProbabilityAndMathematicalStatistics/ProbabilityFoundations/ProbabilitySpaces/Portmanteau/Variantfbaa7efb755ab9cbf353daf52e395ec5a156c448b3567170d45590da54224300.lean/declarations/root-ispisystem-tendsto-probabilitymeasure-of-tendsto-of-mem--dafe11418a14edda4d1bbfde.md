## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a2751181-758e-f702-051f-a36df2e1c70f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 831–866.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma _root_.IsPiSystem.tendsto_probabilityMeasure_of_tendsto_of_mem
    [TopologicalSpace Ω] [SecondCountableTopology Ω] [OpensMeasurableSpace Ω]

    {l : Filter ι} [l.IsCountablyGenerated]
    (hmeas : ∀ s ∈ S, MeasurableSet s)
    (h : ∀ (u : Set Ω), IsOpen u → ∀ x ∈ u, ∃ s ∈ S, s ∈ 𝓝 x ∧ s ⊆ u)
    (h' : ∀ s ∈ S, Tendsto (fun i ↦ μ i s) l (𝓝 (ν s))) :
    Tendsto μ l (𝓝 ν) := by
  /- We apply the portmanteau theorem: it suffices to show that, given an open set `G`
  and `r < ν G`, then for large `i` one has `r < μᵢ G`. For this, we approximate `G` from inside by
  a finite union `G'` of elements of `S`, still with measure `> r`, by Lemma
  `ProbabilityMeasure.exists_lt_measure_biUnion_of_isOpen`. If we have `μᵢ G' → ν G'`,
  then we deduce `r < μᵢ G'` for large `i`, and therefore `r < μᵢ G`.

  Our assumption does not give directly `μᵢ G' → ν G'`, as `G'` does not belong to the π-system `S`.
  However, the inclusion-exclusion formula makes it possible to express `μᵢ G'` and `ν G'` in terms
  of the measures of intersections of elements of `S`, for which we have the convergence. It follows
  that `μᵢ G' → ν G'` holds, concluding the proof. This second step is already formalized in the
  lemma `IsPiSystem.tendsto_probabilityMeasure_biUnion`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Portmanteau/Variantfbaa7efb755ab9cbf353daf52e395ec5a156c448b3567170d45590da54224300.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Portmanteau/Variantfbaa7efb755ab9cbf353daf52e395ec5a156c448b3567170d45590da54224300.lean#L831).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1f294c28555f406334e7150d6c9bad95a2eeda0d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
