## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f5677f91-fd27-e2d1-7500-e50eadc9a9eb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 228–242.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma IsPreBrownianReal.smul (hB : IsPreBrownianReal B P) {c : ℝ≥0} (hc : c ≠ 0) :
    IsPreBrownianReal (fun t ω ↦ (√c)⁻¹ * B (c * t) ω) P := by
  refine IsGaussianProcess.isPreBrownianReal_of_covariance ?_ (fun t ↦ ?_) (fun s t hst ↦ ?_)
  · have this t ω : (√c)⁻¹ * B (c * t) ω = (√c)⁻¹ • ((B ∘ (c * ·)) t ω) := rfl
    simp_rw [this]
    exact (hB.isGaussianProcess.comp_right _).smul _
  · rw [integral_const_mul, hB.integral_eval, mul_zero]
  · rw [covariance_const_mul_left, covariance_const_mul_right, hB.covariance_eval, min_eq_left]
    · simp [field]
    · exact mul_le_mul_right hst c

/-- **Weak Markov property**: If `B` is a pre-Brownian motion, then
`t ↦ B (t₀ + t) - B t₀` is a pre-Brownian motion which is independent from `(B t, t ≤ t₀)`.
This is the proof that it is pre-Brownian,
see `IsPreBrownianReal.indepFun_shift` for independence. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/Basic/Variantbe4a882831a064198b182550534104b0b9d06fb33adea4ca750161a794051831.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/Basic/Variantbe4a882831a064198b182550534104b0b9d06fb33adea4ca750161a794051831.lean#L228).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dbd5a9638d2326fb2d19e0230681fb41d06e191e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
