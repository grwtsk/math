## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:52cca7d2-c449-ac7f-6bc4-d813e3f03673`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 219–227.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma IsPreBrownianReal.neg (hB : IsPreBrownianReal B P) : IsPreBrownianReal (-B) P := by
  refine HasIndepIncrements.isPreBrownianReal_of_hasLaw (fun t ↦ ?_) (fun n t ht ↦ ?_)
  · simpa using gaussianReal_neg (hB.hasLaw_eval t)
  convert (hB.hasIndepIncrements n t ht).comp (fun _ x ↦ -x) (by fun_prop)
  simp
  grind

/-- If `B` is a pre-Brownian motion and `c > 0`, then
`t ↦ (√c)⁻¹ B (c t)` is a pre-Brownian motion. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/Basic/Variantbe4a882831a064198b182550534104b0b9d06fb33adea4ca750161a794051831.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/Basic/Variantbe4a882831a064198b182550534104b0b9d06fb33adea4ca750161a794051831.lean#L219).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dbd5a9638d2326fb2d19e0230681fb41d06e191e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
