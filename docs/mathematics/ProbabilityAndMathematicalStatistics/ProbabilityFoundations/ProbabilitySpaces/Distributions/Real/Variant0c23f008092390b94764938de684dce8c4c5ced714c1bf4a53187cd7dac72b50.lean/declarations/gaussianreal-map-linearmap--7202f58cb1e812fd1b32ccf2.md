## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b83fc85c-c332-ce48-9b16-41c3ecac4295`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 556–566.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma gaussianReal_map_linearMap (L : ℝ →ₗ[ℝ] ℝ) :
    (gaussianReal μ v).map L = gaussianReal (L μ) ((L 1 ^ 2).toNNReal * v) := by
  have : (L : ℝ → ℝ) = fun x ↦ L 1 * x := by
    ext x
    have : x = x • 1 := by simp
    conv_lhs => rw [this, L.map_smul, smul_eq_mul, mul_comm]
  rw [this, gaussianReal_map_const_mul]

  simp only [mul_one, left_eq_sup]
  positivity

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/Real/Variant0c23f008092390b94764938de684dce8c4c5ced714c1bf4a53187cd7dac72b50.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/Real/Variant0c23f008092390b94764938de684dce8c4c5ced714c1bf4a53187cd7dac72b50.lean#L556).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a73616cd867487e32bb70b077d764bc71cc2e187` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
