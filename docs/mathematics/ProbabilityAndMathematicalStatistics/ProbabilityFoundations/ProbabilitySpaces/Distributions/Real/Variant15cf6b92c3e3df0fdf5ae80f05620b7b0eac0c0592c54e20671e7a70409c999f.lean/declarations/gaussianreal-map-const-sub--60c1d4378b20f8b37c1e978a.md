## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9ebcad4d-0d3a-860c-7ed9-6af16ae45094`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 382–392.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma gaussianReal_map_const_sub (y : ℝ) :
    (gaussianReal μ v).map (y - ·) = gaussianReal (y - μ) v := by
  simp_rw [sub_eq_add_neg]
  have : (fun x ↦ y + -x) = (fun x ↦ y + x) ∘ fun x ↦ -x := by ext; simp
  rw [this, ← Measure.map_map (by fun_prop) (by fun_prop), gaussianReal_map_neg,
    gaussianReal_map_const_add, add_comm]

variable {Ω : Type*} {mΩ : MeasurableSpace Ω} {P : Measure Ω} {X : Ω → ℝ}

/-- If `X` is a real random variable with Gaussian law with mean `μ` and variance `v`, then `X + y`
has Gaussian law with mean `μ + y` and variance `v`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/Real/Variant15cf6b92c3e3df0fdf5ae80f05620b7b0eac0c0592c54e20671e7a70409c999f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/Real/Variant15cf6b92c3e3df0fdf5ae80f05620b7b0eac0c0592c54e20671e7a70409c999f.lean#L382).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3aa9f1f04d6844c6765be50edbf1a536c3da4a27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
