## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0ad1cc2c-b2b0-bda2-a2ba-1fcce4c5afaf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 545–554.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma integral_id_gaussianReal : ∫ x, x ∂gaussianReal μ v = μ := by
  rw [← deriv_mgf_zero (by simp), mgf_fun_id_gaussianReal, _root_.deriv_exp (by fun_prop)]
  simp only [mul_zero, ne_eq, OfNat.ofNat_ne_zero, not_false_eq_true, zero_pow, zero_div,
    add_zero, Real.exp_zero, one_mul]
  rw [deriv_fun_add (by fun_prop) (by fun_prop), deriv_fun_mul (by fun_prop) (by fun_prop)]
  simp

/-- The variance of a real Gaussian distribution `gaussianReal μ v` is
its variance parameter `v`. -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/Real/Variant15cf6b92c3e3df0fdf5ae80f05620b7b0eac0c0592c54e20671e7a70409c999f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/Real/Variant15cf6b92c3e3df0fdf5ae80f05620b7b0eac0c0592c54e20671e7a70409c999f.lean#L545).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3aa9f1f04d6844c6765be50edbf1a536c3da4a27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
