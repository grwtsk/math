## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2cef7b449657e51527d955cdabfc7562a018ec8f3506c7a77afa3f068a60b994`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 249–256.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def normalize (f : α → ℝ≥0∞) (hf0 : tsum f ≠ 0) (hf : tsum f ≠ ∞) : Pmf α :=
  ⟨fun a => f a * (∑' x, f x)⁻¹,
    ENNReal.summable.hasSum_iff.2 (ENNReal.tsum_mul_right.trans (ENNReal.mul_inv_cancel hf0 hf))⟩
#align pmf.normalize Pmf.normalize

variable {f : α → ℝ≥0∞} (hf0 : tsum f ≠ 0) (hf : tsum f ≠ ∞)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/Constructions/Variant3a7f79bc62e3c5a5a24f288a74a9195723a22fc5a81996dfed95b7e91c4f45f8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/Constructions/Variant3a7f79bc62e3c5a5a24f288a74a9195723a22fc5a81996dfed95b7e91c4f45f8.lean#L249).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ddbd418075a574abf5a6a5ef3f63afaa1515eb7a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
