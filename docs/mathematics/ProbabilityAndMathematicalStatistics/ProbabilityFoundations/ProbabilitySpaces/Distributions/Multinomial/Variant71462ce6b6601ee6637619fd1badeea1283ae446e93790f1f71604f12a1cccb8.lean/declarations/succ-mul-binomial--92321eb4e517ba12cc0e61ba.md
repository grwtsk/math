## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:377ca045-4d3b-23db-5c54-a592db02f876`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 179–188.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem succ_mul_binomial [DecidableEq α] (h : a ≠ b) :
    (f a + f b).succ * multinomial {a, b} f =
      (f a).succ * multinomial {a, b} (Function.update f a (f a).succ) := by
  rw [binomial_eq_choose h, binomial_eq_choose h, mul_comm (f a).succ, Function.update_self,
    Function.update_of_ne h.symm]
  rw [succ_eq_add_one, add_one_mul_choose_eq (f a + f b) (f a), succ_add (f a) (f b)]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/Multinomial/Variant71462ce6b6601ee6637619fd1badeea1283ae446e93790f1f71604f12a1cccb8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/Multinomial/Variant71462ce6b6601ee6637619fd1badeea1283ae446e93790f1f71604f12a1cccb8.lean#L179).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a2836454d7dbbdabbb4dd186e4e838521febb27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
