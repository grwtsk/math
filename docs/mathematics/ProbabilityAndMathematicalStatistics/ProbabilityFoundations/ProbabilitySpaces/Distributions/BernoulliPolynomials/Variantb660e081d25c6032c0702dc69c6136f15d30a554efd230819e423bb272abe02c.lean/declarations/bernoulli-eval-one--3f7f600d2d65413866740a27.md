## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:54572f22-742b-c994-f993-6a2c5cea38bf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 80–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem bernoulli_eval_one (n : ℕ) : (bernoulli n).eval 1 = bernoulli' n := by
  simp only [bernoulli, eval_finset_sum]
  simp only [← succ_eq_add_one, sum_range_succ, mul_one, cast_one, choose_self,
    (_root_.bernoulli _).mul_comm, sum_bernoulli, one_pow, mul_one, eval_C, eval_monomial, one_mul]
  by_cases h : n = 1
  · norm_num [h]
  · simp [h, bernoulli_eq_bernoulli'_of_ne_one h]

end Examples

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/BernoulliPolynomials/Variantb660e081d25c6032c0702dc69c6136f15d30a554efd230819e423bb272abe02c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Distributions/BernoulliPolynomials/Variantb660e081d25c6032c0702dc69c6136f15d30a554efd230819e423bb272abe02c.lean#L80).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `36c75d1b52a290fee20d1d40bdd35295d5dbdffa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
