## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d5dd18259d4f5fc9e5c2da40b8b69ca023fe337eda03d962bd84f97b4892b3c6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 105–112.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IndepSet {_mΩ : MeasurableSpace Ω} (s t : Set Ω) (κ : Kernel α Ω)
    (μ : Measure α := by volume_tac) : Prop :=
  Indep (generateFrom {s}) (generateFrom {t}) κ μ

/-- A family of functions defined on the same space `Ω` and taking values in possibly different
spaces, each with a measurable space structure, is independent if the family of measurable space
structures they generate on `Ω` is independent. For a function `g` with codomain having measurable
space structure `m`, the generated measurable space structure is `MeasurableSpace.comap g m`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Kernel/Variant428db988d73bb10b67d43da6ce80f0257490563146b9547216028dd35b053969.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/Kernel/Variant428db988d73bb10b67d43da6ce80f0257490563146b9547216028dd35b053969.lean#L105).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c4d62da9c247988144f392f1a1386e6f6c34bc36` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
