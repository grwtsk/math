## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a6aea81e-cb2a-ee24-806d-7504133d4c6b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 302–315.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma sum_meas_smul_cond_fiber {X : Ω → α} (hX : Measurable X) (μ : Measure Ω) [IsFiniteMeasure μ] :
    ∑ x, μ (X ⁻¹' {x}) • μ[|X ← x] = μ := by
  ext E hE
  calc
    _ = ∑ x, μ (X ⁻¹' {x} ∩ E) := by
      simp only [Measure.coe_finset_sum, Measure.coe_smul, Finset.sum_apply,
        Pi.smul_apply, smul_eq_mul]
      simp_rw [mul_comm (μ _), cond_mul_eq_inter (hX (.singleton _))]
    _ = _ := by
      have : ⋃ x ∈ Finset.univ, X ⁻¹' {x} ∩ E = E := by ext; simp
      rw [← measure_biUnion_finset _ fun _ _ ↦ (hX (.singleton _)).inter hE, this]
      aesop (add simp [PairwiseDisjoint, Set.Pairwise, Function.onFun, disjoint_left])

end ProbabilityTheory
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/ConditionalProbability/Varianta6f0922c68ad55628f6b585531e73e9c258b8cdfe6f0ad1d41a5b863b8e359f6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/ProbabilitySpaces/ConditionalProbability/Varianta6f0922c68ad55628f6b585531e73e9c258b8cdfe6f0ad1d41a5b863b8e359f6.lean#L302).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bdb344a93c1e042c1c8391d95a22db68441bd00f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
