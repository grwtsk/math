## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f034a71d-bba0-c4c3-5e26-7ee7e815fe90`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 103–120.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem countedUsedInDegree_insert
    (m : ℕ) (c : BinaryEdgeWord m → ℕ)
    (used : Finset (CountedBinaryEdge m c))
    (e : CountedBinaryEdge m c) (fresh : e ∉ used)
    (v : Fin m → Bool) :
    countedUsedInDegree m c (insert e used) v =
      countedUsedInDegree m c used v +
        (if countedEdgeTarget m c e = v then 1 else 0) := by
  classical
  unfold countedUsedInDegree
  by_cases hv : countedEdgeTarget m c e = v
  · simp [Finset.filter_insert, hv, Finset.card_insert_of_not_mem,
      fresh]
  · simp [Finset.filter_insert, hv]

/-- The finite used-edge imbalance of an actual fresh counted trail
is exactly its starting indicator minus its terminal indicator.
This is the endpoint conservation identity needed by Hierholzer. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/FiniteCountedEulerDegreeBalance.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/FiniteCountedEulerDegreeBalance.lean#L103).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `348c0913ceb094c6e774cab53e6dfe8f5213162f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
