## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0bf94b04-31ed-ed59-98c4-22e4a0330e8e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 364–377.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem CountedWalk.factor_of_visits
    {m : ℕ} {c : BinaryEdgeWord m → ℕ}
    {a b v : Fin m → Bool}
    (T : CountedWalk m c a b)
    (hv : T.Visits v) :
    ∃ (P : CountedWalk m c a v)
      (Q : CountedWalk m c v b),
      T.edges.toFinset = P.edges.toFinset ∪ Q.edges.toFinset := by
  obtain ⟨P, Q, hlist⟩ := hv
  refine ⟨P, Q, ?_⟩
  rw [hlist, List.toFinset_append]
  exact Finset.union_comm _ _

/-- Every directed walk visits its terminal vertex. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/FiniteCountedEulerWalkConcat.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/ProbabilityAndMathematicalStatistics/ProbabilityFoundations/FiniteCountedEulerWalkConcat.lean#L364).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b3aaa6b1f7b042d1548fb141708399427e99b3b5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
