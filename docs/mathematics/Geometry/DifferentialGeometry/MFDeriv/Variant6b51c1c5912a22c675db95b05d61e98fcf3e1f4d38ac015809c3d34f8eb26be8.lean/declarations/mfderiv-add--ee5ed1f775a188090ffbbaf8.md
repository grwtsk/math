## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b3c944fe-43d3-7dc4-a74a-0cd2b86b5443`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1614–1620.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mfderiv_add (hf : MDifferentiableAt I 𝓘(𝕜, E') f z)
    (hg : MDifferentiableAt I 𝓘(𝕜, E') g z) :
    (mfderiv I 𝓘(𝕜, E') (f + g) z : TangentSpace I z →L[𝕜] E') =
      @Add.add (TangentSpace I z →L[𝕜] E') _ (mfderiv I 𝓘(𝕜, E') f z) (mfderiv I 𝓘(𝕜, E') g z) :=
  (hf.hasMFDerivAt.add hg.hasMFDerivAt).mfderiv
#align mfderiv_add mfderiv_add

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/MFDeriv/Variant6b51c1c5912a22c675db95b05d61e98fcf3e1f4d38ac015809c3d34f8eb26be8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/MFDeriv/Variant6b51c1c5912a22c675db95b05d61e98fcf3e1f4d38ac015809c3d34f8eb26be8.lean#L1614).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3059d261aa559865c043589ed73a1c3e5078e16d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
