## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7d32186880cd247c95041bb3738643d48792832ac3c98b5c0cb126ab5d8259a2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 253–272.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def isCLMReduciblyDefeqCoefficients (e : Expr) : TermElabM <| Expr × Expr × Expr := do
  match_expr e with
  | ContinuousLinearMap k S _ _ σ E _ _ F _ _ _ _ =>
    trace[Elab.DiffGeo.MDiff] "`{e}` is a space of continuous (semi-)linear maps"
    unless ← withReducible <| pureIsDefEq k S do
      throwError "Coefficients `{k}` and `{S}` of `{e}` are not reducibly definitionally equal"
    match_expr ← whnfR σ with
    | RingHom.id _ _ => return (k, E, F)
    | _ => throwError "`{e}` is a space of continuous (semi-)linear maps over `{σ}`, \
      which is not the identity"
  | _ => throwError "`{e}` is not a space of continuous linear maps"

/--
Captures information when a model with corners is the trivial model on a normed space
(or on an inner product space, which is also a normed space):
contains the expressions describing the normed space and its base field.

Searching for a model with corners will return an `Option NormedSpaceInfo`,
which is `some` if and only if the trivial model on a normed space was found.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Notation/Variant3f73b4d6e098bdbab48f6155b4d3cbeb2b7249b03cc1b62682c6ef3249daa772.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Notation/Variant3f73b4d6e098bdbab48f6155b4d3cbeb2b7249b03cc1b62682c6ef3249daa772.lean#L253).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `82bafcdb5b5220b506995e1568afb2cfeb7853c6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
