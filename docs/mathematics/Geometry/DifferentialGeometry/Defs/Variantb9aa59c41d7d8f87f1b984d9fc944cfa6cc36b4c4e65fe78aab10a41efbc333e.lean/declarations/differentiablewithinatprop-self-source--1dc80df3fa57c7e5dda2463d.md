## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:44a8d573-32fe-d298-2c4d-e2fc48f204d4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 133–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem differentiableWithinAtProp_self_source {f : E → H'} {s : Set E} {x : E} :
    DifferentiableWithinAtProp 𝓘(𝕜, E) I' f s x ↔ DifferentiableWithinAt 𝕜 (I' ∘ f) s x := by
  simp_rw [DifferentiableWithinAtProp, modelWithCornersSelf_coe, range_id, inter_univ,
    modelWithCornersSelf_coe_symm, CompTriple.comp_eq, preimage_id_eq, id_eq]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Defs/Variantb9aa59c41d7d8f87f1b984d9fc944cfa6cc36b4c4e65fe78aab10a41efbc333e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Defs/Variantb9aa59c41d7d8f87f1b984d9fc944cfa6cc36b4c4e65fe78aab10a41efbc333e.lean#L133).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e4a5653f1c80fac7aa9fa904409bcada1d6759d4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
