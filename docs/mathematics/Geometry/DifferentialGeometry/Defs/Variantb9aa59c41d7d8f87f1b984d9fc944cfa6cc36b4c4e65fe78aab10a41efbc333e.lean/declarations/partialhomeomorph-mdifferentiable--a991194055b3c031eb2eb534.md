## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2637586928bff4fa73fe53f5d800718e5f5d992e23cd8bcd6d1b414aef39774e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 279–293.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def PartialHomeomorph.MDifferentiable (f : PartialHomeomorph M M') :=
  MDifferentiableOn I I' f f.source ∧ MDifferentiableOn I' I f.symm f.target

variable (I I') in
/-- `HasMFDerivWithinAt I I' f s x f'` indicates that the function `f` between manifolds
has, at the point `x` and within the set `s`, the derivative `f'`. Here, `f'` is a continuous linear
map from the tangent space at `x` to the tangent space at `f x`.

This is a generalization of `HasFDerivWithinAt` to manifolds (as indicated by the prefix `m`).
The order of arguments is changed as the type of the derivative `f'` depends on the choice of `x`.

We require continuity in the definition, as otherwise points close to `x` in `s` could be sent by
`f` outside of the chart domain around `f x`. Then the chart could do anything to the image points,
and in particular by coincidence `writtenInExtChartAt I I' x f` could be differentiable, while
this would not mean anything relevant. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Defs/Variantb9aa59c41d7d8f87f1b984d9fc944cfa6cc36b4c4e65fe78aab10a41efbc333e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Defs/Variantb9aa59c41d7d8f87f1b984d9fc944cfa6cc36b4c4e65fe78aab10a41efbc333e.lean#L279).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e4a5653f1c80fac7aa9fa904409bcada1d6759d4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
