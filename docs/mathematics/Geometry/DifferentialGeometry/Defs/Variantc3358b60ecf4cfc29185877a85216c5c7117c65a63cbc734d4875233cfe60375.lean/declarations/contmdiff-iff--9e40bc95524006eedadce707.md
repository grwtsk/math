## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3b67dbb0-3a72-f7fb-28f3-facce81b12f5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 576–586.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem contMDiff_iff :
    ContMDiff I I' n f ↔
      Continuous f ∧
        ∀ (x : M) (y : M'),
          ContDiffOn 𝕜 n (extChartAt I' y ∘ f ∘ (extChartAt I x).symm)
            ((extChartAt I x).target ∩
              (extChartAt I x).symm ⁻¹' (f ⁻¹' (extChartAt I' y).source)) := by
  simp [← contMDiffOn_univ, contMDiffOn_iff, continuous_iff_continuousOn_univ]

/-- One can reformulate being `C^n` as continuity and being `C^n` in any extended chart in the
target. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Defs/Variantc3358b60ecf4cfc29185877a85216c5c7117c65a63cbc734d4875233cfe60375.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Defs/Variantc3358b60ecf4cfc29185877a85216c5c7117c65a63cbc734d4875233cfe60375.lean#L576).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a09ef88902e31effc13a32653c4edc052505d3be` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
