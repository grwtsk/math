## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:66781a09-27af-5f43-a259-409f82ae5653`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 266–274.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem MDifferentiableAt.differentiableWithinAt_writtenInExtChartAt {f : M → M'} {x : M}
    (hf : MDifferentiableAt I I' f x) :
    DifferentiableWithinAt 𝕜 (writtenInExtChartAt I I' x f) (range I) ((extChartAt I x) x) :=
  mdifferentiableAt_iff .. |>.1 hf |>.2

variable (I I') in
/-- `MDifferentiableOn I I' f s` indicates that the function `f` between manifolds
has a derivative within `s` at all points of `s`.
This is a generalization of `DifferentiableOn` to manifolds. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Defs/Variantfcee05306398fccc214cdd3f780d980da4f29cd57143aec694b403bfd7b864c3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Defs/Variantfcee05306398fccc214cdd3f780d980da4f29cd57143aec694b403bfd7b864c3.lean#L266).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f7b06aec9c2f5d2ae4645ff68085386565fcf2ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
