## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a4037f7d-8e1c-79e8-cb8f-9a0049086368`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 192–207.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem contMDiffAt_iff {n : ℕ∞ω} {f : M → M'} {x : M} :
    ContMDiffAt I I' n f x ↔
      ContinuousAt f x ∧
        ContDiffWithinAt 𝕜 n (extChartAt I' (f x) ∘ f ∘ (extChartAt I x).symm) (range I)
          (extChartAt I x x) :=
  liftPropAt_iff.trans <| by rw [ContDiffWithinAtProp, preimage_univ, univ_inter]; rfl

variable (I I') in
/-- `ContMDiffOn I I' n f s` indicates that the function `f : M → M'` between manifolds
is `n` times continuously differentiable in a set `s : Set M`.

`f` is `n` times continuously differentiable on `s` if it is continuous on `s` and,
for any pair of points, it is `n` times continuously differentiable `s` in the charts
around these points.
The parameter `n` belongs to `ℕ∞ω` (accessible in the `ContDiff` scope), i.e. it can be a natural
number, `∞`, or `ω`, where `C^ω` corresponds to analytic functions. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Defs/Variantfe6dca179bbcf7589829e29effc901ba3909515aa94e20a02c69ecc2cf2acfe2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Defs/Variantfe6dca179bbcf7589829e29effc901ba3909515aa94e20a02c69ecc2cf2acfe2.lean#L192).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3a8fd08a24c8d264cab038a5aa88f876ff523695` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
