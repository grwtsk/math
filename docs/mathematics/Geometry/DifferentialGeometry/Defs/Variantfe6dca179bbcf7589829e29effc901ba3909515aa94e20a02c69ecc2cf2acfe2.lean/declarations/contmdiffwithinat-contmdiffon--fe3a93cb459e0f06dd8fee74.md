## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ccf6d3ab-f868-3b46-594b-57d9ec54287c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 827–836.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContMDiffWithinAt.contMDiffOn
    [IsManifold I n M] [IsManifold I' n M']
    (hm : m ≤ n) (h' : m = ∞ → n = ω)
    (h : ContMDiffWithinAt I I' n f s x) :
    ∃ u ∈ 𝓝[insert x s] x, u ⊆ insert x s ∧ ContMDiffOn I I' m f u := by
  let ⟨_u, uo, xu, h⟩ := h.contMDiffOn' hm h'
  exact ⟨_, inter_mem_nhdsWithin _ (uo.mem_nhds xu), inter_subset_left, h⟩

/-- A function is `C^n` at a point, for `n : ℕ`, if and only if it is `C^n` on
a neighborhood of this point. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Defs/Variantfe6dca179bbcf7589829e29effc901ba3909515aa94e20a02c69ecc2cf2acfe2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Defs/Variantfe6dca179bbcf7589829e29effc901ba3909515aa94e20a02c69ecc2cf2acfe2.lean#L827).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3a8fd08a24c8d264cab038a5aa88f876ff523695` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
