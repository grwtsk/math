## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:967f4b86a301cf5a52e453d86b632bed0d6b47c05f9634cf77873d753a492881`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 516–522.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def single (i : ι) (s : Set M) : SmoothPartitionOfUnity ι I M s :=
  (BumpCovering.single i s).toSmoothPartitionOfUnity fun j => by
    rcases eq_or_ne j i with (rfl | h)
    · simp only [smooth_one, ContinuousMap.coe_one, BumpCovering.coe_single, Pi.single_eq_same]
    · simp only [smooth_zero, BumpCovering.coe_single, Pi.single_eq_of_ne h, ContinuousMap.coe_zero]
#align smooth_partition_of_unity.single SmoothPartitionOfUnity.single

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/PartitionOfUnity/Variantcacd753a0ce6c5147cd92b7a128509652297d366a34dc3477018c7bff8251852.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/PartitionOfUnity/Variantcacd753a0ce6c5147cd92b7a128509652297d366a34dc3477018c7bff8251852.lean#L516).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4fbe80846490fa0ce645fa8807e372f696f7cdaf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
