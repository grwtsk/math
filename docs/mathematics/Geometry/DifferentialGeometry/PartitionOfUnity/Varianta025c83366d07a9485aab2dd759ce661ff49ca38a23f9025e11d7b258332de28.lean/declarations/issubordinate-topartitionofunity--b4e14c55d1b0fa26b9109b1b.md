## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1d813661-3ddf-2386-b818-5aa07e037856`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 286–294.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isSubordinate_toPartitionOfUnity :
    f.toPartitionOfUnity.IsSubordinate U ↔ f.IsSubordinate U :=
  Iff.rfl

alias ⟨_, IsSubordinate.toPartitionOfUnity⟩ := isSubordinate_toPartitionOfUnity

/-- If `f` is a smooth partition of unity on a set `s : Set M` subordinate to a family of open sets
`U : ι → Set M` and `g : ι → M → F` is a family of functions such that `g i` is $C^n$ smooth on
`U i`, then the sum `fun x ↦ ∑ᶠ i, f i x • g i x` is $C^n$ smooth on the whole manifold. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/PartitionOfUnity/Varianta025c83366d07a9485aab2dd759ce661ff49ca38a23f9025e11d7b258332de28.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/PartitionOfUnity/Varianta025c83366d07a9485aab2dd759ce661ff49ca38a23f9025e11d7b258332de28.lean#L286).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8ad678ee53933a200bc5596ae5ba6c8963edf22d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
