## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e78488eb-3c78-09a4-1a0b-8c56820c4c44`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 663–672.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem exists_contMDiffMap_forall_mem_convex_of_local_const (ht : ∀ x, Convex ℝ (t x))
    (Hloc : ∀ x : M, ∃ c : F, ∀ᶠ y in 𝓝 x, c ∈ t y) : ∃ g : C^n⟮I, M; 𝓘(ℝ, F), F⟯, ∀ x, g x ∈ t x :=
  exists_contMDiffMap_forall_mem_convex_of_local I ht fun x =>
    let ⟨c, hc⟩ := Hloc x
    ⟨_, hc, fun _ => c, contMDiffOn_const, fun _ => id⟩

/-- Let `M` be a smooth σ-compact manifold with extended distance. Let `K : ι → Set M` be a locally
finite family of closed sets, let `U : ι → Set M` be a family of open sets such that `K i ⊆ U i` for
all `i`. Then there exists a positive smooth function `δ : M → ℝ≥0` such that for any `i` and
`x ∈ K i`, we have `Metric.closedEBall x (δ x) ⊆ U i`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/PartitionOfUnity/Varianta025c83366d07a9485aab2dd759ce661ff49ca38a23f9025e11d7b258332de28.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/PartitionOfUnity/Varianta025c83366d07a9485aab2dd759ce661ff49ca38a23f9025e11d7b258332de28.lean#L663).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8ad678ee53933a200bc5596ae5ba6c8963edf22d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
