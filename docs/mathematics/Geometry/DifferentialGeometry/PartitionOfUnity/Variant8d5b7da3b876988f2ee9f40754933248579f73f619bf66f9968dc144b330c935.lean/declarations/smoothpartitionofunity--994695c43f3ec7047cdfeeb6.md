## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:eb37d677a154e67a14a4a9225d347a13f202ad27d8c0537402529de0be4297cb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 117–134.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure SmoothPartitionOfUnity (s : Set M := univ) where
  /-- The family of functions forming the partition of unity. -/
  toFun : ι → C^∞⟮I, M; 𝓘(ℝ), ℝ⟯
  /-- Around each point, there are only finitely many nonzero functions in the family. -/
  locallyFinite' : LocallyFinite fun i => support (toFun i)
  /-- All the functions in the partition of unity are nonnegative. -/
  nonneg' : ∀ i x, 0 ≤ toFun i x
  /-- The functions in the partition of unity add up to `1` at any point of `s`. -/
  sum_eq_one' : ∀ x ∈ s, ∑ᶠ i, toFun i x = 1
  /-- The functions in the partition of unity add up to at most `1` everywhere. -/
  sum_le_one' : ∀ x, ∑ᶠ i, toFun i x ≤ 1

variable {ι I M}

namespace SmoothPartitionOfUnity

variable {s : Set M} (f : SmoothPartitionOfUnity ι I M s) {n : ℕ∞}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/PartitionOfUnity/Variant8d5b7da3b876988f2ee9f40754933248579f73f619bf66f9968dc144b330c935.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/PartitionOfUnity/Variant8d5b7da3b876988f2ee9f40754933248579f73f619bf66f9968dc144b330c935.lean#L117).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a10cf6138007c00b7943e6b7829b868308b749d9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
