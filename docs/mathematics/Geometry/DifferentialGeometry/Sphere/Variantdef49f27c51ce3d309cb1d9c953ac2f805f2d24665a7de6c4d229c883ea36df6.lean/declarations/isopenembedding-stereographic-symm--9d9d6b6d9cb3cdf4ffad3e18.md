## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2077edc0-5ade-7ec6-a51d-7fa850231aef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 315–344.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Charted space structure on the sphere

In this section we construct a charted space structure on the unit sphere in a finite-dimensional
real inner product space `E`; that is, we show that it is locally homeomorphic to the Euclidean
space of dimension one less than `E`.

The restriction to finite dimension is for convenience.  The most natural `ChartedSpace`
structure for the sphere uses the stereographic projection from the antipodes of a point as the
canonical chart at this point.  However, the codomain of the stereographic projection constructed
in the previous section is `(ℝ ∙ v)ᗮ`, the orthogonal complement of the vector `v` in `E` which is
the "north pole" of the projection, so a priori these charts all have different codomains.

So it is necessary to prove that these codomains are all continuously linearly equivalent to a
fixed normed space.  This could be proved in general by a simple case of Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization, but in the finite-dimensional case it follows more easily by dimension-counting.

/-- Variant of the stereographic projection, for the sphere in an `n + 1`-dimensional inner product
space `E`.  This version has codomain the Euclidean space of dimension `n`, and is obtained by
composing the original stereographic projection (`stereographic`) with an arbitrary linear isometry
from `(ℝ ∙ v)ᗮ` to the Euclidean space. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Sphere/Variantdef49f27c51ce3d309cb1d9c953ac2f805f2d24665a7de6c4d229c883ea36df6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
