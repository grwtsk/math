## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8b5761dacaedbda8f172ea7a8609d6bd800fcb668442f159f9e57ed7a2b24c6a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 376–383.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def stereographic' (n : ℕ) [Fact (finrank ℝ E = n + 1)] (v : sphere (0 : E) 1) :
    LocalHomeomorph (sphere (0 : E) 1) (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)) :=
  stereographic (norm_eq_of_mem_sphere v) ≫ₕ
    (OrthonormalBasis.fromOrthogonalSpanSingleton n
            (ne_zero_of_mem_unit_sphere v)).repr.toHomeomorph.toLocalHomeomorph
#align stereographic' stereographic'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Sphere/Variantf58491a5407bd31d6cf7872080af24030b27930819c5b33a44e9ede4554c03d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Sphere/Variantf58491a5407bd31d6cf7872080af24030b27930819c5b33a44e9ede4554c03d7.lean#L376).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b3bea2732c79c6b5954fccb03aede9c3303635cb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
