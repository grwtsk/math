## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9a9763f47f78655a4fc772804e9d5983e9cd6aac189ebfff78cab1d5b19f0a72`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 245–266.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def stereographic (hv : ‖v‖ = 1) : PartialHomeomorph (sphere (0 : E) 1) (ℝ ∙ v)ᗮ where
  toFun := stereoToFun v ∘ (↑)
  invFun := stereoInvFun hv
  source := {⟨v, by simp [hv]⟩}ᶜ
  target := Set.univ
  map_source' := by simp
  map_target' {w} _ := fun h => (stereoInvFun_ne_north_pole hv w) (Set.eq_of_mem_singleton h)
  left_inv' x hx := stereo_left_inv hv fun h => hx (by
    rw [← h] at hv
    apply Subtype.ext
    dsimp
    exact h)
  right_inv' w _ := stereo_right_inv hv w
  open_source := isOpen_compl_singleton
  open_target := isOpen_univ
  continuousOn_toFun :=
    continuousOn_stereoToFun.comp continuous_subtype_val.continuousOn fun w h => by
      dsimp
      exact
        h ∘ Subtype.ext ∘ Eq.symm ∘ (inner_eq_one_iff_of_norm_one hv (by simp)).mp
  continuousOn_invFun := (continuous_stereoInvFun hv).continuousOn

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Sphere/Variant2e5b287c02f2583b816692cc8647df3e4548bb2fe1e7d238a8883c90173f8153.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Sphere/Variant2e5b287c02f2583b816692cc8647df3e4548bb2fe1e7d238a8883c90173f8153.lean#L245).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4988d581da34e5f744eddcce5caeb0ccd62c7df7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
