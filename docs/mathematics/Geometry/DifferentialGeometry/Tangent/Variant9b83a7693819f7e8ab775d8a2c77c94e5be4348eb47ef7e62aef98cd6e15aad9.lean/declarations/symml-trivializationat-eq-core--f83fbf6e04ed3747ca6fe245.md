## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7af1ba27-43f9-ec8b-8120-7ab04d47df93`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 287–294.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem symmL_trivializationAt_eq_core {b₀ b : M} (hb : b ∈ (chartAt H b₀).source) :
    (trivializationAt E (TangentSpace I) b₀).symmL 𝕜 b =
      (tangentBundleCore I M).coordChange (achart H b₀) (achart H b) b := by
  simp [hb]

/-! The lemmas below have high priority because `simp` simplifies the LHS to `.id _ _`;
we prefer `1` as the simp-normal form. -/
@[simp high, mfld_simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Tangent/Variant9b83a7693819f7e8ab775d8a2c77c94e5be4348eb47ef7e62aef98cd6e15aad9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Tangent/Variant9b83a7693819f7e8ab775d8a2c77c94e5be4348eb47ef7e62aef98cd6e15aad9.lean#L287).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `01c1c4ba331ffb253513292547acb94c281ae8f0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
