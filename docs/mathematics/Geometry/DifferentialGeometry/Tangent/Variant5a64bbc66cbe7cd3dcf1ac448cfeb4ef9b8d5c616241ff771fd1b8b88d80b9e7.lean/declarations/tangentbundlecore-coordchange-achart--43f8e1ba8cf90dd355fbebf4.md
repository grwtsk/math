## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:88759de0-1836-9e70-e497-7c6b766126d2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 129–142.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tangentBundleCore_coordChange_achart (x x' z : M) :
    (tangentBundleCore I M).coordChange (achart H x) (achart H x') z =
      fderivWithin 𝕜 (extChartAt I x' ∘ (extChartAt I x).symm) (range I) (extChartAt I x z) :=
  rfl

section tangentCoordChange

variable (I) in
/-- In a manifold `M`, given two preferred charts indexed by `x y : M`, `tangentCoordChange I x y`
is the family of derivatives of the corresponding change-of-coordinates map. It takes junk values
outside the intersection of the sources of the two charts.

Note that this definition takes advantage of the fact that `tangentBundleCore` has the same base
sets as the preferred charts of the base manifold. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Tangent/Variant5a64bbc66cbe7cd3dcf1ac448cfeb4ef9b8d5c616241ff771fd1b8b88d80b9e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Tangent/Variant5a64bbc66cbe7cd3dcf1ac448cfeb4ef9b8d5c616241ff771fd1b8b88d80b9e7.lean#L129).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `934fab2dbf638b2530ee925d6b60e4b199bd04f4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
