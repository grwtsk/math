## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e5af77be-91ac-69cb-8ccf-a9d1a2919bd7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 249–263.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContMDiffAt.mfderiv_const {x₀ : M} {f : M → M'} (hf : CMDiffAt n f x₀)
    (hmn : m + 1 ≤ n) :
    CMDiffAt m (inTangentCoordinates I I' id f (mfderiv% f) x₀) x₀ :=
  haveI : CMDiffAt n (fun x : M × M ↦ f x.2) (x₀, x₀) :=
    ContMDiffAt.comp (x₀, x₀) hf contMDiffAt_snd
  this.mfderiv (fun _ ↦ f) id contMDiffAt_id hmn

/-- The function that sends `x` to the `y`-derivative of `f(x,y)` at `g(x)` applied to `g₂(x)` is
`C^n` at `x₀`, where the derivative is taken as a continuous linear map.
We have to assume that `f` is `C^(n+1)` at `(x₀, g(x₀))` and `g` is `C^n` at `x₀`.
We have to insert a coordinate change from `x₀` to `g₁(x)` to make the derivative sensible.

This is similar to `ContMDiffAt.mfderiv`, but where the continuous linear map is applied to a
(variable) vector.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/ContMDiffMFDeriv/Variantc33c3134f6d94bc451e2fde2d1544f4370cff892a7e8355424de58d700e80adb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/ContMDiffMFDeriv/Variantc33c3134f6d94bc451e2fde2d1544f4370cff892a7e8355424de58d700e80adb.lean#L249).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `25a8536f3f108b876025898888e11534f91450da` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
