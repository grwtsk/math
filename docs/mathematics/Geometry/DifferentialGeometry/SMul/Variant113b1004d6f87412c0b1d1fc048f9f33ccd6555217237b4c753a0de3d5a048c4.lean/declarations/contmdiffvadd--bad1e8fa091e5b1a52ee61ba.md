## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ded7017fb429c1ff7547fd482ba21d3090f16e659d0a018347d7ad2ca07211a1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 59–75.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class ContMDiffVAdd {𝕜 : Type*} [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜] {H : Type*} [TopologicalSpace H]
    {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace 𝕜 E] (I : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E H)
    {H' : Type*} [TopologicalSpace H'] {E' : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E'] [NormedSpace 𝕜 E']
    (I' : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E' H') (n : ℕ∞ω)
    (G : Type*) [TopologicalSpace G] [ChartedSpace H G]
    (M : Type*) [TopologicalSpace M] [ChartedSpace H' M] [VAdd G M] : Prop where
  contMDiff_vadd : CMDiff n fun p : G × M ↦ p.1 +ᵥ p.2

/-- Basic typeclass stating that the action of `G` on `M` is Cⁿ as a function `G × M → M`.
Unlike with `ContMDiffMul` (the class stating that multiplication `G × G → G` within a single type
`G` is Cⁿ), we do not extend `IsManifold` because `ContMDiffSMul` contains more
explicit arguments than `IsManifold` and so `ContMDiffSMul.toIsManifold` could not be an instance
anyway: this means that in order for `ContMDiffSMul` to be meaningful, smoothness of `G` and `M`
have to be required separately. For example, to state that `G` is a Cⁿ Lie group with a Cⁿ action on
a Cⁿ manifold `M`, one can use the typeclasses
`[LieGroup I n G] [IsManifold I' n M] [ContMDiffSMul I I' n G M]`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/SMul/Variant113b1004d6f87412c0b1d1fc048f9f33ccd6555217237b4c753a0de3d5a048c4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/SMul/Variant113b1004d6f87412c0b1d1fc048f9f33ccd6555217237b4c753a0de3d5a048c4.lean#L59).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f96c1a941b583f142a956cae85c952405c26f96d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
