## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6e2986d97dcacb658af38b16064fb9915d3621f83d3836b43ad1bc5dc51bfffc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 397–415.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def transDiffeomorph : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E' H where
  toPartialEquiv := I.toPartialEquiv.trans e.toEquiv.toPartialEquiv
  source_eq := by simp
  uniqueDiffOn' := by
    have hn : 1 ≤ n := ENat.one_le_iff_ne_zero_withTop.mpr (NeZero.ne n)
    simp [I.uniqueDiffOn, hn]
  target_subset_closure_interior := by
    simp only [PartialEquiv.trans_target, Equiv.toPartialEquiv_target,
      Equiv.toPartialEquiv_symm_apply, Diffeomorph.toEquiv_coe_symm, target_eq, univ_inter]
    change e.toHomeomorph.symm ⁻¹' _ ⊆ closure (interior (e.toHomeomorph.symm ⁻¹' (range I)))
    rw [← e.toHomeomorph.symm.isOpenMap.preimage_interior_eq_interior_preimage
      e.toHomeomorph.continuous_symm,
      ← e.toHomeomorph.symm.isOpenMap.preimage_closure_eq_closure_preimage
      e.toHomeomorph.continuous_symm]

  continuous_toFun := e.continuous.comp I.continuous
  continuous_invFun := I.continuous_symm.comp e.symm.continuous

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Diffeomorph/Variantdc73e09e3c104d9971b1da03868c8cc193b955f6c4e7d758b77f43ec9c9de6ad.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Diffeomorph/Variantdc73e09e3c104d9971b1da03868c8cc193b955f6c4e7d758b77f43ec9c9de6ad.lean#L397).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `580997ba3ae378113e1ed2f2cf5d817c247fd0be` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
