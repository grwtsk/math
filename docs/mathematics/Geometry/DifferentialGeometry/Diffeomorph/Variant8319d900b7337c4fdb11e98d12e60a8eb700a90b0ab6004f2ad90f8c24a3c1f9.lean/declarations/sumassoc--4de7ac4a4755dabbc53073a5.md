## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:441b2016bd5f2600090a8aa87adc87dc588846c05212bdb36eb6f1702cfc4329`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 646–657.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def sumAssoc : Diffeomorph I I ((M ⊕ M') ⊕ M'') (M ⊕ (M' ⊕ M'')) n where
  toEquiv := Equiv.sumAssoc M M' M''
  contMDiff_toFun := by
    apply ContMDiff.sumElim
    · exact contMDiff_id.sumMap ContMDiff.inl
    · exact ContMDiff.inr.comp ContMDiff.inr
  contMDiff_invFun := by
    apply ContMDiff.sumElim
    · exact ContMDiff.inl.comp ContMDiff.inl
    · exact ContMDiff.inr.sumMap contMDiff_id

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Diffeomorph/Variant8319d900b7337c4fdb11e98d12e60a8eb700a90b0ab6004f2ad90f8c24a3c1f9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Diffeomorph/Variant8319d900b7337c4fdb11e98d12e60a8eb700a90b0ab6004f2ad90f8c24a3c1f9.lean#L646).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e6bff92c7d5200919e5eff534b1098eced622e85` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
