## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:124ef44a9ef695ffd1c3d7cfe5354354f9f397f7066abb230d5d4912c041e92b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 51–64.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class ContMDiffAdd {𝕜 : Type*} [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜] {H : Type*} [TopologicalSpace H]
    {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace 𝕜 E]
    (I : ModelWithCorners 𝕜 E H) (n : WithTop ℕ∞)
    (G : Type*) [Add G] [TopologicalSpace G] [ChartedSpace H G] : Prop
    extends IsManifold I n G where
  contMDiff_add : ContMDiff (I.prod I) I n fun p : G × G => p.1 + p.2

@[deprecated (since := "2025-01-09")] alias SmoothAdd := ContMDiffAdd

-- See note [Design choices about smooth algebraic structures]
/-- Basic hypothesis to talk about a `C^n` (Lie) monoid or a `C^n` semigroup.
A `C^n` monoid over `G`, for example, is obtained by requiring both the instances `Monoid G`
and `ContMDiffMul I n G`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Monoid/Variant91e12c8f569649fdcd59eedcdd23f29504c827e73560cd52042b6d0bdc5bb77b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Monoid/Variant91e12c8f569649fdcd59eedcdd23f29504c827e73560cd52042b6d0bdc5bb77b.lean#L51).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `213cc287878b1c187e497b34f5b2e951c1d848c3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
