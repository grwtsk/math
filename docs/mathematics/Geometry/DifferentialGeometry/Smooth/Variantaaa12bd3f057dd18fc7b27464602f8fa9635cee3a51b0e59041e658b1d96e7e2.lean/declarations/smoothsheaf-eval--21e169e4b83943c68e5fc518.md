## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:309f6d4e161df47ba457000afb215a7304d2205162ec7a931a8ee41c443e8d80`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 112–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def smoothSheaf.eval (x : M) : (smoothSheaf IM I M N).presheaf.stalk x → N :=
  TopCat.stalkToFiber (StructureGroupoid.LocalInvariantProp.localPredicate M N _) x

/-- Canonical map from the stalk of `smoothSheaf IM I M N` at `x` to `N`, given by evaluating
sections at `x`, considered as a morphism in the category of types. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Smooth/Variantaaa12bd3f057dd18fc7b27464602f8fa9635cee3a51b0e59041e658b1d96e7e2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Smooth/Variantaaa12bd3f057dd18fc7b27464602f8fa9635cee3a51b0e59041e658b1d96e7e2.lean#L112).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `476f47d527c0d340cae23555ab99e7d80b527abe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
