## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7ea66edc-7010-8898-5c65-3bcbd2fa5ecb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–85.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma mdifferentiableAt_iff {f : ℍ → ℂ} {τ : ℍ} :
    MDiffAt f τ ↔ DifferentiableAt ℂ (f ∘ ofComplex) ↑τ := by
  rw [← mdifferentiableAt_iff_differentiableAt]
  refine ⟨fun hf ↦ ?_, fun hf ↦ ?_⟩
  · exact (ofComplex_apply τ ▸ hf).comp _ (mdifferentiableAt_ofComplex τ.im_pos)
  · simpa only [Function.comp_def, ofComplex_apply] using hf.comp τ (mdifferentiable_coe τ)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Manifold/Variant4e6a7b963d7e1b7a612b63182910dcad586443e55aa118890058627a1532b977.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Manifold/Variant4e6a7b963d7e1b7a612b63182910dcad586443e55aa118890058627a1532b977.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `99f59935cef06f0fcf1929639d48e29a7f138b40` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
