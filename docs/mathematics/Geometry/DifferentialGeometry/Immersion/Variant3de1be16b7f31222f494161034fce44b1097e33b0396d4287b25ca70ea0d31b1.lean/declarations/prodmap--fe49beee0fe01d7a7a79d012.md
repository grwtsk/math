## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ab129b3f-2e64-0ab0-8b75-9f9f5c701d5d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 841–852.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem prodMap {f : M → N} {g : M' → N'}
    [IsManifold I n M] [IsManifold I' n M'] [IsManifold J n N] [IsManifold J' n N']
    (h : IsImmersionOfComplement F I J n f) (h' : IsImmersionOfComplement F' I' J' n g) :
    IsImmersionOfComplement (F × F') (I.prod I') (J.prod J') n (Prod.map f g) :=
  fun ⟨x, x'⟩ ↦ (h x).prodMap (h' x')

/-- If `f` is an immersion w.r.t. some complement `F`, it is an immersion.

Note that the proof contains a small formalisation-related subtlety: `F` can live in any universe,
while being an immersion requires the existence of a complement in the same universe as
the model normed space of `N`. This is solved by `smallComplement` and `smallEquiv`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Immersion/Variant3de1be16b7f31222f494161034fce44b1097e33b0396d4287b25ca70ea0d31b1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Immersion/Variant3de1be16b7f31222f494161034fce44b1097e33b0396d4287b25ca70ea0d31b1.lean#L841).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `23c6443c76265e8edb72ffe0f16497aae96eaf1a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
