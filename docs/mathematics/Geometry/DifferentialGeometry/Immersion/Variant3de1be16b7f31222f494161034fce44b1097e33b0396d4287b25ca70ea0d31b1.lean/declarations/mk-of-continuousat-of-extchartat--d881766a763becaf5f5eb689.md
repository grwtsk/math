## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:36c20638-ef87-f4f1-73a4-6c1b011f3891`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 239–251.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma mk_of_continuousAt_of_extChartAt [IsManifold I n M] [IsManifold J n N]
    {f : M → N} {x : M} (hf : ContinuousAt f x) (equiv : (E × F) ≃L[𝕜] E'')
    (hwrittenInExtend : EqOn ((extChartAt J (f x)) ∘ f ∘ (extChartAt I x).symm) (equiv ∘ (·, 0))
      (extChartAt I x).target) : IsImmersionAtOfComplement F I J n f x :=
  mk_of_continuousAt hf equiv (chartAt H x) (chartAt G (f x))
    (mem_chart_source H x) (mem_chart_source G (f x))
    (IsManifold.chart_mem_maximalAtlas x) (IsManifold.chart_mem_maximalAtlas (f x)) hwrittenInExtend

/-- A choice of chart on the domain `M` of an immersion `f` at `x`:
w.r.t. this chart and the data `h.codChart` and `h.equiv`,
`f` will look like an inclusion `u ↦ (u, 0)` in these extended charts.
The particular chart is arbitrary, but this choice matches the witnesses given by
`h.codChart` and `h.codChart`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Immersion/Variant3de1be16b7f31222f494161034fce44b1097e33b0396d4287b25ca70ea0d31b1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Immersion/Variant3de1be16b7f31222f494161034fce44b1097e33b0396d4287b25ca70ea0d31b1.lean#L239).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `23c6443c76265e8edb72ffe0f16497aae96eaf1a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
