## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:75f06b2b2a76a13eabafd1ee1a2ef908a2749101c519206fba3e5d132750afc3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 411–425.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ModelWithCorners.pi {𝕜 : Type u} [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜] {ι : Type v} [Fintype ι]
    {E : ι → Type w} [∀ i, NormedAddCommGroup (E i)] [∀ i, NormedSpace 𝕜 (E i)] {H : ι → Type u'}
    [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (H i)] (I : ∀ i, ModelWithCorners 𝕜 (E i) (H i)) :
    ModelWithCorners 𝕜 (∀ i, E i) (ModelPi H) where
  toPartialEquiv := PartialEquiv.pi fun i => (I i).toPartialEquiv
  source_eq := by simp only [pi_univ, mfld_simps]
  uniqueDiffOn' := UniqueDiffOn.pi ι E _ _ fun i _ => (I i).uniqueDiffOn'
  target_subset_closure_interior := by
    simp only [PartialEquiv.pi_target, target_eq, finite_univ, interior_pi_set, closure_pi_set]
    exact Set.pi_mono (fun i _ ↦ (I i).range_subset_closure_interior)
  continuous_toFun := continuous_pi fun i => (I i).continuous.comp (continuous_apply i)
  continuous_invFun := continuous_pi fun i => (I i).continuous_symm.comp (continuous_apply i)

/-- Special case of product model with corners, which is trivial on the second factor. This shows up
as the model to tangent bundles. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant839ef69546a0af23685c4223a2f7ec84a4376e1750e0f2c2ebe6d221a729d14d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant839ef69546a0af23685c4223a2f7ec84a4376e1750e0f2c2ebe6d221a729d14d.lean#L411).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ee3c2d7d5a330683c58061f8093012ae5079e619` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
