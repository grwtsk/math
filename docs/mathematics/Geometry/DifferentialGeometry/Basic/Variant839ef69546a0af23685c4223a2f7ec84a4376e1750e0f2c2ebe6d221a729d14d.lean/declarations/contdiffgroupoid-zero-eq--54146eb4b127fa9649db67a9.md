## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3ced1061-76f2-c801-a324-98815f2c86c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 570–586.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem contDiffGroupoid_zero_eq : contDiffGroupoid 0 I = continuousGroupoid H := by
  apply le_antisymm le_top
  intro u _
  -- we have to check that every partial homeomorphism belongs to `contDiffGroupoid 0 I`,
  -- by unfolding its definition
  change u ∈ contDiffGroupoid 0 I
  rw [contDiffGroupoid, mem_groupoid_of_pregroupoid, contDiffPregroupoid]
  simp only [contDiffOn_zero]
  constructor
  · refine I.continuous.comp_continuousOn (u.continuousOn.comp I.continuousOn_symm ?_)
    exact (mapsTo_preimage _ _).mono_left inter_subset_left
  · refine I.continuous.comp_continuousOn (u.symm.continuousOn.comp I.continuousOn_symm ?_)
    exact (mapsTo_preimage _ _).mono_left inter_subset_left

-- FIXME: does this generalise to other groupoids? The argument is not specific
-- to C^n functions, but uses something about the groupoid's property that is not easy to abstract.
/-- Any change of coordinates with empty source belongs to `contDiffGroupoid`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant839ef69546a0af23685c4223a2f7ec84a4376e1750e0f2c2ebe6d221a729d14d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant839ef69546a0af23685c4223a2f7ec84a4376e1750e0f2c2ebe6d221a729d14d.lean#L570).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ee3c2d7d5a330683c58061f8093012ae5079e619` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
