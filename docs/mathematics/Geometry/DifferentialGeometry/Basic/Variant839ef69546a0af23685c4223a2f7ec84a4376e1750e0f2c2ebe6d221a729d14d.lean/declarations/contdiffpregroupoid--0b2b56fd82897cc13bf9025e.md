## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e2399c8722a6229559b94109b497980de330c903124c4e52d7d50b6315805139`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 518–556.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  property f s := ContDiffOn 𝕜 n (I ∘ f ∘ I.symm) (I.symm ⁻¹' s ∩ range I)
  comp {f g u v} hf hg _ _ _ := by
    have : I ∘ (g ∘ f) ∘ I.symm = (I ∘ g ∘ I.symm) ∘ I ∘ f ∘ I.symm := by ext x; simp
    simp only [this]
    refine hg.comp (hf.mono fun x ⟨hx1, hx2⟩ ↦ ⟨hx1.1, hx2⟩) ?_

of `H` as the invertible maps that are `C^n` when read in `E` through `I`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant839ef69546a0af23685c4223a2f7ec84a4376e1750e0f2c2ebe6d221a729d14d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant839ef69546a0af23685c4223a2f7ec84a4376e1750e0f2c2ebe6d221a729d14d.lean#L518).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ee3c2d7d5a330683c58061f8093012ae5079e619` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
