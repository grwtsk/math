## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4ce053d5-9e70-b783-fdfb-37e8dc99008e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1215–1226.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mfderivWithin_comp_of_preimage_mem_nhdsWithin (hg : MDiffAt[u] g (f x))
    (hf : MDiffAt[s] f x) (h : f ⁻¹' u ∈ 𝓝[s] x) (hxs : UniqueMDiffAt[s] x) :
    mfderiv[s] (g ∘ f) x = (mfderiv[u] g (f x)).comp (mfderiv[s] f x) := by
  have A : s ∩ f ⁻¹' u ∈ 𝓝[s] x := Filter.inter_mem self_mem_nhdsWithin h
  have B : mfderiv[s] (g ∘ f) x = mfderiv[s ∩ f ⁻¹' u] (g ∘ f) x := by
    apply MDifferentiableWithinAt.mfderivWithin_mono_of_mem_nhdsWithin _ hxs A
    exact hg.comp _ (hf.mono inter_subset_left) inter_subset_right
  have C : mfderiv[s] f x = mfderiv[s ∩ f ⁻¹' u] f x :=
    MDifferentiableWithinAt.mfderivWithin_mono_of_mem_nhdsWithin (hf.mono inter_subset_left) hxs A
  rw [B, C]
  exact mfderivWithin_comp _ hg (hf.mono inter_subset_left) inter_subset_right (hxs.inter' h)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant89ad9b2128a3eb6f56770c4053dee0dc6f989b8017d1dcc9ca164f3c15616786.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant89ad9b2128a3eb6f56770c4053dee0dc6f989b8017d1dcc9ca164f3c15616786.lean#L1215).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `68a6306e02e35b1c57668a66531828346e868c4e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
