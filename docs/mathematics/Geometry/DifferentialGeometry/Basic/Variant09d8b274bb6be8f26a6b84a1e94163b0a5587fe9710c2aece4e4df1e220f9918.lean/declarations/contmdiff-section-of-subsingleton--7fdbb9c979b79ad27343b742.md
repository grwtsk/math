## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5db15d54-ee20-99fd-c6b8-da0dca2577c5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 285–312.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    ContMDiff IB (IB.prod 𝓘(𝕜, F)) n (fun x ↦ TotalSpace.mk' F x (s x)) :=
  fun _x ↦ contMDiffAt_section_of_subsingleton ..

end Bundle

/-- When `B` is a manifold with respect to a model `IB` and `E` is a
topological vector bundle over `B` with fibers isomorphic to `F`,
then `ContMDiffVectorBundle n F E IB` registers that the bundle is `C^n`, in the sense of having
`C^n` transition functions. This is a mixin, not carrying any new data. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant09d8b274bb6be8f26a6b84a1e94163b0a5587fe9710c2aece4e4df1e220f9918.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant09d8b274bb6be8f26a6b84a1e94163b0a5587fe9710c2aece4e4df1e220f9918.lean#L285).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
