## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:650c7fae4c26886ba7e6e7c0d38a35e7aaa40d544f10197766e87e2f433c8aee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class ContMDiffCovariantDerivativeOn [IsManifold I 1 M] [VectorBundle 𝕜 F V] (k : ℕ∞ω)
    (cov : (Π x : M, V x) → (Π x : M, TangentSpace I x →L[𝕜] V x))
    (u : Set M) where
  contMDiff : ∀ {σ : Π x : M, V x}, CMDiff[u] (k + 1) (T% σ) →
    letI cov (x : M) : TotalSpace (E →L[𝕜] F) fun x ↦ TangentSpace I x →L[𝕜] V x := ⟨x, cov σ x⟩
    ContMDiffOn I (I.prod 𝓘(𝕜, E →L[𝕜] F)) k cov u
    -- TODO elaborators are not working here. We want to use `T% (cov σ)` and CMDiff[u] k f

variable {F}

namespace IsCovariantDerivativeOn

/-! ### Changing set

In this section, we change `s` in `IsCovariantDerivativeOn F cov s`, proving the condition is
monotone and local.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant01a92be9100970091d3c67a83f1acad2142bcdb73133339ac2a250577bf379a8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant01a92be9100970091d3c67a83f1acad2142bcdb73133339ac2a250577bf379a8.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c9563d266d97b9201d51fce894db3958bc18e43` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
