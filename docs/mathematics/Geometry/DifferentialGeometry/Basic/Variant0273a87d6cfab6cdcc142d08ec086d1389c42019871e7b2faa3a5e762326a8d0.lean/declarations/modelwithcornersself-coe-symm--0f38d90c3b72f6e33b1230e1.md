## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:170947f7-75ba-9b15-6b84-1ed5fcb91b54`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 384–398.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem modelWithCornersSelf_coe_symm : (𝓘(𝕜, E).symm : E → E) = id :=
  rfl

end

end

section ModelWithCornersProd

/-- Given two model_with_corners `I` on `(E, H)` and `I'` on `(E', H')`, we define the model with
corners `I.prod I'` on `(E × E', ModelProd H H')`. This appears in particular for the manifold
structure on the tangent bundle to a manifold modelled on `(E, H)`: it will be modelled on
`(E × E, H × E)`. See note [Manifold type tags] for explanation about `ModelProd H H'`
vs `H × H'`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant0273a87d6cfab6cdcc142d08ec086d1389c42019871e7b2faa3a5e762326a8d0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant0273a87d6cfab6cdcc142d08ec086d1389c42019871e7b2faa3a5e762326a8d0.lean#L384).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5d24b8bc50a4f542e6d883e04f5e7191abc7b8e4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
