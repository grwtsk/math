## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b38c9fdc-94eb-5c38-fb68-b1910c3bba58`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 226–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem contMDiff_proj : ContMDiff (IB.prod 𝓘(𝕜, F)) IB n (π F E) := fun x ↦ by
  have : ContMDiffAt (IB.prod 𝓘(𝕜, F)) (IB.prod 𝓘(𝕜, F)) n id x := contMDiffAt_id
  rw [contMDiffAt_totalSpace] at this
  exact this.1
#align bundle.cont_mdiff_proj Bundle.contMDiff_proj

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant370c732e6bd4d09a9fc339300187ccfbbdf539ba751218d9bd0a2455ce7fd324.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant370c732e6bd4d09a9fc339300187ccfbbdf539ba751218d9bd0a2455ce7fd324.lean#L226).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `eb54446ef768f7fd34d217b063a4b43ec4cc3e0d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
