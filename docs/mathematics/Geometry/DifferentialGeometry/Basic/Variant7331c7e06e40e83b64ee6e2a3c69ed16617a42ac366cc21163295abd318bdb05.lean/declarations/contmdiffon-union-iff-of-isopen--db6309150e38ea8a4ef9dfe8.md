## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e88df84b-14d9-fd1c-5213-bc68b8cf4c28`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 333–337.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma contMDiffOn_union_iff_of_isOpen (hs : IsOpen s) (ht : IsOpen t) :
    ContMDiffOn I I' n f (s ∪ t) ↔ ContMDiffOn I I' n f s ∧ ContMDiffOn I I' n f t :=
  ⟨fun h ↦ ⟨h.mono subset_union_left, h.mono subset_union_right⟩,
   fun ⟨hfs, hft⟩ ↦ ContMDiffOn.union_of_isOpen hfs hft hs ht⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant7331c7e06e40e83b64ee6e2a3c69ed16617a42ac366cc21163295abd318bdb05.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant7331c7e06e40e83b64ee6e2a3c69ed16617a42ac366cc21163295abd318bdb05.lean#L333).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4d602545af9c564c34abd31ced9fd416ae58cb1b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
