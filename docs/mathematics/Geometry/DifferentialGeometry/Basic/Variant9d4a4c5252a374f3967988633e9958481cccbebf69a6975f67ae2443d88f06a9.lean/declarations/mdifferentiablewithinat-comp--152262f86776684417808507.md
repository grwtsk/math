## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:82761a1f-7389-8420-c253-3efdcebb92d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1127–1135.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem MDifferentiableWithinAt.comp (hg : MDifferentiableWithinAt I' I'' g u (f x))
    (hf : MDifferentiableWithinAt I I' f s x) (h : s ⊆ f ⁻¹' u) :
    MDifferentiableWithinAt I I'' (g ∘ f) s x := by
  rcases hf.2 with ⟨f', hf'⟩
  have F : HasMFDerivWithinAt I I' f s x f' := ⟨hf.1, hf'⟩
  rcases hg.2 with ⟨g', hg'⟩
  have G : HasMFDerivWithinAt I' I'' g u (f x) g' := ⟨hg.1, hg'⟩
  exact (HasMFDerivWithinAt.comp x G F h).mdifferentiableWithinAt

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant9d4a4c5252a374f3967988633e9958481cccbebf69a6975f67ae2443d88f06a9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/Basic/Variant9d4a4c5252a374f3967988633e9958481cccbebf69a6975f67ae2443d88f06a9.lean#L1127).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4e587fe5b3410f6e5528e9b31a119d3c873f9680` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
