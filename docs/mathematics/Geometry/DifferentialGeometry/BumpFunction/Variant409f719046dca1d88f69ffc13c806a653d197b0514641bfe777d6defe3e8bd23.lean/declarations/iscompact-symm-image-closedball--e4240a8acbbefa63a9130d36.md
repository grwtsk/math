## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:931b9aef-495e-1e30-c47d-3fbf2c03ec03`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 189–198.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isCompact_symm_image_closedBall :
    IsCompact ((extChartAt I c).symm '' (closedBall (extChartAt I c c) f.rOut ∩ range I)) :=
  ((isCompact_closedBall _ _).inter_right I.isClosed_range).image_of_continuousOn <|
    (continuousOn_extChartAt_symm _).mono f.closedBall_subset

end FiniteDimensional

/-- Given a smooth bump function `f : SmoothBumpFunction I c`, the closed ball of radius `f.R` is
known to include the support of `f`. These closed balls (in the model normed space `E`) intersected
with `Set.range I` form a basis of `𝓝[range I] (extChartAt I c c)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/BumpFunction/Variant409f719046dca1d88f69ffc13c806a653d197b0514641bfe777d6defe3e8bd23.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DifferentialGeometry/BumpFunction/Variant409f719046dca1d88f69ffc13c806a653d197b0514641bfe777d6defe3e8bd23.lean#L189).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aa82be51558f7581a6fa7873eea78df06781e000` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
