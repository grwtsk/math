## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:30383e66db608480401bab0d91b7710d08d0b7d116884109bc26bf1db14d9400`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 49–62.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance injective_isLocalAtTarget : IsLocalAtTarget (topologically Function.Injective) := by
  refine topologically_isLocalAtTarget _ (fun _ s _ _ h ↦ h.restrictPreimage s)
    fun f ι U H _ hf x₁ x₂ e ↦ ?_
  obtain ⟨i, hxi⟩ : ∃ i, f x₁ ∈ U i := by simpa using congr(f x₁ ∈ $H)
  exact congr(($(@hf i ⟨x₁, hxi⟩ ⟨x₂, show f x₂ ∈ U i from e ▸ hxi⟩ (Subtype.ext e))).1)

end Injective

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/UnderlyingMap/Variant767f3bb951795edb0d1cd32999591a417358b0bb01105ff0f4f86dabad31b906.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/UnderlyingMap/Variant767f3bb951795edb0d1cd32999591a417358b0bb01105ff0f4f86dabad31b906.lean#L49).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3abc737c4a7edc74cc7ea39853431ba5dc9aa44d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
