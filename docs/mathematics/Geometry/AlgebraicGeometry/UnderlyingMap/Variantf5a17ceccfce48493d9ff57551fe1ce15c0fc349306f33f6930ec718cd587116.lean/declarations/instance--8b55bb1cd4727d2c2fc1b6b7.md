## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:478cc5bb6927d570b3ee9950e8f90670ce7ff2c034486bc1ee5ad1fc261ced6a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 125–130.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {X : Scheme.{u}} {P : MorphismProperty Scheme.{u}} (𝒰 : X.Cover (Scheme.precoverage P)) :
    Surjective (Limits.Sigma.desc fun i ↦ 𝒰.f i) :=
  Surjective.sigmaDesc_of_union_range_eq_univ 𝒰.iUnion_range

/-- The single object covering by one surjective morphism satisfying `P`. -/
@[simps! I₀ X f]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/UnderlyingMap/Variantf5a17ceccfce48493d9ff57551fe1ce15c0fc349306f33f6930ec718cd587116.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/UnderlyingMap/Variantf5a17ceccfce48493d9ff57551fe1ce15c0fc349306f33f6930ec718cd587116.lean#L125).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a342e3c6e8d2060420121f7c881360e7a7306423` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
