## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:42bf751e-0b81-555c-c925-a63f83d503d1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 683–699.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Spec.forIn'_list_const_inv
    {xs : List α} {init : β} {f : (a : α) → a ∈ xs → β → m (ForInStep β)}
    {inv : (β → Pred)}
    {epost : EPred}
    (step : ∀ x (hx : x ∈ xs) b,
      Triple
        (f x hx b)
        (inv b)
        (fun r => match r with | .yield b' => inv b' | .done b' => inv b')
        epost) :
    Triple (forIn' xs init f) (inv init) inv epost :=
  Spec.forIn'_list (fun _ b => inv b)
    (fun _p c _s h b => step c (by rw [h]; exact List.mem_append_right _ (List.Mem.head _)) b)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/SpecLemmas/Variant352ced72fc74646a5dc68d28dfeb2cdb756038d61458976e61007f9aa28cc573.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/SpecLemmas/Variant352ced72fc74646a5dc68d28dfeb2cdb756038d61458976e61007f9aa28cc573.lean#L683).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4610651c0bd9fbc022aa7a0fd6447ac97c1b647e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
