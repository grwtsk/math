## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f34e1336-ffe9-f709-6d33-9b9bc09b9d9d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 837–854.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Spec.foldlM_list
    {xs : List α} {init : β} {f : β → α → m β}
    (inv : Invariant xs β ps)
    (step : ∀ pref cur suff (h : xs = pref ++ cur :: suff) b,
      Triple
        (f b cur)
        (inv.1 (⟨pref, cur::suff, h.symm⟩, b))
        (fun b' => inv.1 (⟨pref ++ [cur], suff, by simp [h]⟩, b'), inv.2)) :
    Triple (List.foldlM f init xs) (inv.1 (⟨[], xs, rfl⟩, init)) (fun b => inv.1 (⟨xs, [], by simp⟩, b), inv.2) := by
  have : xs.foldlM f init = forIn xs init (fun a b => .yield <$> f b a) := by
    simp only [List.forIn_yield_eq_foldlM, id_map']

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/SpecLemmas/Variant09869237e782fb495d788ac7b17d58e10b14c1cb8519b69def2539a5f6dd5db6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/SpecLemmas/Variant09869237e782fb495d788ac7b17d58e10b14c1cb8519b69def2539a5f6dd5db6.lean#L837).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `565e710ecdc3dcba2201dacdecda4b4cf2273efd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
