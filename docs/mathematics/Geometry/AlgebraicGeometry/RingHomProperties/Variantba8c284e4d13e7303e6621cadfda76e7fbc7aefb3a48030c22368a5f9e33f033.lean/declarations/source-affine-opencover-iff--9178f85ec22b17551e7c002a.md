## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0b3d4c8b-5c10-1151-9088-d1e2fb24e555`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 491–505.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem source_affine_openCover_iff {X Y : Scheme.{u}} (f : X ⟶ Y) [IsAffine Y]
    (𝒰 : Scheme.OpenCover.{u} X) [∀ i, IsAffine (𝒰.obj i)] :
    sourceAffineLocally (@P) f ↔ ∀ i, P (Scheme.Γ.map (𝒰.map i ≫ f).op) := by
  -- Porting note: seems like TFAE is misbehaving; this used to be pure term proof but
  -- had strange failures where the output of TFAE turned into a metavariable when used despite
  -- being correctly displayed in the infoview

    apply h.mp
    exact H
  · have h := (hP.affine_openCover_TFAE f).out 1 0
    apply h.mp
    use 𝒰
#align ring_hom.property_is_local.source_affine_open_cover_iff RingHom.PropertyIsLocal.source_affine_openCover_iff

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/RingHomProperties/Variantba8c284e4d13e7303e6621cadfda76e7fbc7aefb3a48030c22368a5f9e33f033.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/RingHomProperties/Variantba8c284e4d13e7303e6621cadfda76e7fbc7aefb3a48030c22368a5f9e33f033.lean#L491).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9cb86b07c5c9fe20bccc7dabe7036a473cfa1a3d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
