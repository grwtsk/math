## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8dfef927e029840524ccc2d4e2935fcfac1ac9029ccb9b1598429d74f29d1c5c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 373–385.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure PureTensorActualH1Comparison
    {v : OddSignRow E}
    {X : SignControlledXi E v}
    (R : WeightOneCMRealization E v X) where
  toActual : E ⊗[ℚ] E →ₗ[ℚ] R.H1C
  pureTensor_coordinates :
    ∀ a x σ,
      R.h1ComplexCoordinates (toActual (a ⊗ₜ[ℚ] x)) σ =
        R.pureTensorCoordinate a x σ

/-- The realization's rational inclusion data canonically constructs the
pure-tensor comparison; no additional tensor-level comparison supplier is
needed. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Hodge/CMWeightOneRiemannRealization.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/AlgebraicGeometry/Hodge/CMWeightOneRiemannRealization.lean#L373).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e632f5554fdc09dafe2880ed91b404169b0b3d99` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
