## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d60b6e212256df8e8923e9557fdbe5a76192d737bf042d1e379643c041c127c0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 518–533.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

def openCoverOfBase' (𝒰 : OpenCover Z) (f : X ⟶ Z) (g : Y ⟶ Z) : OpenCover (pullback f g) := by
  apply (openCoverOfLeft (𝒰.pullbackCover f) f g).bind
  intro i
  haveI := ((IsPullback.of_hasPullback (pullback.snd g (𝒰.map i))
    (pullback.snd f (𝒰.map i))).paste_horiz (IsPullback.of_hasPullback _ _)).flip

/-- Given an open cover `{ Zᵢ }` of `Z`, then `X ×[Z] Y` is covered by `Xᵢ ×[Zᵢ] Yᵢ`, where
  `Xᵢ = X ×[Z] Zᵢ` and `Yᵢ = Y ×[Z] Zᵢ` is the preimage of `Zᵢ` in `X` and `Y`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Pullbacks/Variante2b8f4b66b6600dc3f564463cf467fadcf57885667cce2915414cb582d7b7c6a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Pullbacks/Variante2b8f4b66b6600dc3f564463cf467fadcf57885667cce2915414cb582d7b7c6a.lean#L518).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `96bf1633e40505d8f53aaf1a59b25241d52d9b1e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
