## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a61b711f-80b9-a6f6-9e5f-756b84c33644`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 266–279.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem gluedLiftPullbackMap_snd (i j : 𝒰.J) :
    gluedLiftPullbackMap 𝒰 f g s i j ≫ pullback.snd _ _ = pullback.snd _ _ ≫ pullback.snd _ _ := by
  simp [gluedLiftPullbackMap]

/-- The lifted map `s.X ⟶ (gluing 𝒰 f g).glued` in order to show that `(gluing 𝒰 f g).glued` is
indeed the pullback.

Given a pullback cone `s`, we have the maps `s.fst ⁻¹' Uᵢ ⟶ Uᵢ` and
`s.fst ⁻¹' Uᵢ ⟶ s.X ⟶ Y` that we may lift to a map `s.fst ⁻¹' Uᵢ ⟶ Uᵢ ×[Z] Y`.

to glue these into a map `s.X ⟶ Uᵢ ×[Z] Y`, we need to show that the maps agree on
`(s.fst ⁻¹' Uᵢ) ×[s.X] (s.fst ⁻¹' Uⱼ) ⟶ Uᵢ ×[Z] Y`. This is achieved by showing that both of these
maps factors through `gluedLiftPullbackMap`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Pullbacks/Variante2b8f4b66b6600dc3f564463cf467fadcf57885667cce2915414cb582d7b7c6a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Pullbacks/Variante2b8f4b66b6600dc3f564463cf467fadcf57885667cce2915414cb582d7b7c6a.lean#L266).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `96bf1633e40505d8f53aaf1a59b25241d52d9b1e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
