## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:95d4ff0b4be6733279787a9a3a976e8238aaefd861e2db83d500d75544c240ed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–52.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def IsAffineOpen.fromSpecStalk
    {X : Scheme} {U : X.Opens} (hU : IsAffineOpen U) {x : X} (hxU : x ∈ U) :
    Spec (X.presheaf.stalk x) ⟶ X :=
  Spec.map (X.presheaf.germ _ x hxU) ≫ hU.fromSpec

/--
The morphism from `Spec(O_x)` to `X` given by `IsAffineOpen.fromSpec` does not depend on the affine
open neighborhood of `x` we choose.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Stalk/Variant9d84861d3d188a739f6aceeddcecf9ea5e9bd04d878ade76bb15827787e76ec0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Stalk/Variant9d84861d3d188a739f6aceeddcecf9ea5e9bd04d878ade76bb15827787e76ec0.lean#L44).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `22ef2229574d1a86a051c065d170f01f4e725f96` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
