## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0dec77dc-3163-c420-16c5-1e2dc679e342`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 249–267.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Spec_stalkClosedPointIso :
    Spec.map (stalkClosedPointIso R).inv = (Spec R).fromSpecStalk (closedPoint R) := by
  rw [stalkClosedPointIso_inv, Scheme.Spec_fromSpecStalk']

end stalkClosedPointIso

section stalkClosedPointTo

variable {R} (f : Spec R ⟶ X)

namespace Scheme

/--
Given a local ring `(R, 𝔪)` and a morphism `f : Spec R ⟶ X`,
they induce a (local) ring homomorphism `φ : 𝒪_{X, f 𝔪} ⟶ R`.

This is inverse to `φ ↦ Spec.map φ ≫ X.fromSpecStalk (f 𝔪)`. See `SpecToEquivOfLocalRing`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Stalk/Variant9d84861d3d188a739f6aceeddcecf9ea5e9bd04d878ade76bb15827787e76ec0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Stalk/Variant9d84861d3d188a739f6aceeddcecf9ea5e9bd04d878ade76bb15827787e76ec0.lean#L249).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `22ef2229574d1a86a051c065d170f01f4e725f96` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
