## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:706dc566ed541f4efcfbabb4dce3acc61823a0d48c0a0b2ff81a505085995b6d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–157.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev smallGrothendieckTopology : GrothendieckTopology (Q.Over ⊤ S) :=
  (MorphismProperty.Over.forget Q ⊤ S).restrictedTopology (S.overGrothendieckTopology P)

@[deprecated (since := "2026-05-28")]
alias smallGrothendieckTopologyOfLE := smallGrothendieckTopology

variable [Q.IsStableUnderBaseChange] [Q.HasOfPostcompProperty Q]

/-- The pretopology defined on the subcategory of `S`-schemes satisfying `Q` where coverings
are given by `P`-coverings in `S`-schemes satisfying `Q`.
The most common case is `P = Q`. In this case, this is simply surjective families
in `S`-schemes with `P`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Small/Variant5c078b801da1cd36204a541aac33b8bef352428c21ad4b69846ae0abc1d16134.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Small/Variant5c078b801da1cd36204a541aac33b8bef352428c21ad4b69846ae0abc1d16134.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b2a28b851baa2e2769c24606de221a26d8a6bac9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
