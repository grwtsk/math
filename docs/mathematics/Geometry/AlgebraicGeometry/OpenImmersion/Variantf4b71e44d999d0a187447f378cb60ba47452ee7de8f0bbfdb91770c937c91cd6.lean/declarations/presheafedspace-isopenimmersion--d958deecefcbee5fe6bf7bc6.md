## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ae04b976097580e37592b67bb3e2ea117a5b9cb731e783e0a7593c1fbab465bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 80–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class PresheafedSpace.IsOpenImmersion {X Y : PresheafedSpace C} (f : X ⟶ Y) : Prop where
  /-- the underlying continuous map of underlying spaces from the source to an open subset of the
  target. -/
  base_open : IsOpenEmbedding f.base
  /-- the underlying sheaf morphism is an isomorphism on each open subset -/
  c_iso : ∀ U : Opens X, IsIso (f.c.app (op (base_open.functor.obj U)))

/-- A morphism of SheafedSpaces is an open immersion if it is an open immersion as a morphism
of PresheafedSpaces
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/OpenImmersion/Variantf4b71e44d999d0a187447f378cb60ba47452ee7de8f0bbfdb91770c937c91cd6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/OpenImmersion/Variantf4b71e44d999d0a187447f378cb60ba47452ee7de8f0bbfdb91770c937c91cd6.lean#L80).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7b5cad5c5347d96072ffac32f1c447d094d643a9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
