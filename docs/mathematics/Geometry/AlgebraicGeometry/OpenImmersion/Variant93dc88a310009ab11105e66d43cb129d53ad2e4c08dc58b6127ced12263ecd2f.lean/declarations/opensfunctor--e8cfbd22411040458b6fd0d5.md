## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cbc3e19dc3f18ca7e455c990e546a3f289962f7bf602931437fea96e9dc6f991`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1186–1196.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev opensFunctor {X Y : LocallyRingedSpace} (f : X ⟶ Y)
    [H : LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion f] : Opens X ⥤ Opens Y :=
  H.base_open.functor

section OfStalkIso

/-- Suppose `X Y : SheafedSpace C`, where `C` is a concrete category,
whose forgetful functor reflects isomorphisms, preserves limits and filtered colimits.
Then a morphism `X ⟶ Y` that is a topological open embedding
is an open immersion iff every stalk map is an iso.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/OpenImmersion/Variant93dc88a310009ab11105e66d43cb129d53ad2e4c08dc58b6127ced12263ecd2f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/OpenImmersion/Variant93dc88a310009ab11105e66d43cb129d53ad2e4c08dc58b6127ced12263ecd2f.lean#L1186).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4840c3b01c4996cb4862762efb493c8d4fe546f0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
