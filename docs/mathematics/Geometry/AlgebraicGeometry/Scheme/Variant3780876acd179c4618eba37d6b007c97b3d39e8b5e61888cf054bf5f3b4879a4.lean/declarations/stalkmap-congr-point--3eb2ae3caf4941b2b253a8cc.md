## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c82bd64-7a2e-7cab-48b7-a9eaf3ee768a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 857–862.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma stalkMap_congr_point (x x' : X) (hxx' : x = x') :
    f.stalkMap x ≫ (X.presheaf.stalkCongr (.of_eq hxx')).hom =
      (Y.presheaf.stalkCongr (.of_eq <| hxx' ▸ rfl)).hom ≫ f.stalkMap x' :=
  LocallyRingedSpace.stalkMap_congr_point f.toLRSHom x x' hxx'

@[reassoc (attr := simp)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme/Variant3780876acd179c4618eba37d6b007c97b3d39e8b5e61888cf054bf5f3b4879a4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme/Variant3780876acd179c4618eba37d6b007c97b3d39e8b5e61888cf054bf5f3b4879a4.lean#L857).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `28a8477ec14111170a566fd8e0b59db66b55fefa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
