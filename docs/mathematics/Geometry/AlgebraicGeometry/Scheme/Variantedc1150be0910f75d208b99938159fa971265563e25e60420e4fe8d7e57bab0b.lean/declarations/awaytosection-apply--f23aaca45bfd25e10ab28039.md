## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c15a35e3-2638-1de8-eb4b-8fd4bf861a3c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 620–635.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma awayToSection_apply (f : A) (x p) :
    (((ProjectiveSpectrum.Proj.awayToSection 𝒜 f).1 x).val p).val =
      IsLocalization.map (M := Submonoid.powers f) (T := p.1.1.toIdeal.primeCompl) _
        (RingHom.id _) (Submonoid.powers_le.mpr p.2) x.val := by
  obtain ⟨x, rfl⟩ := HomogeneousLocalization.mk_surjective x
  show (HomogeneousLocalization.mapId 𝒜 _ _).val = _
  dsimp [HomogeneousLocalization.mapId, HomogeneousLocalization.map]
  rw [Localization.mk_eq_mk', Localization.mk_eq_mk', IsLocalization.map_mk']
  rfl

/--
The ring map from `A⁰_ f` to the global sections of the structure sheaf of the projective spectrum
of `A` restricted to the basic open set `D(f)`.

Mathematically, the map is the same as `awayToSection`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme/Variantedc1150be0910f75d208b99938159fa971265563e25e60420e4fe8d7e57bab0b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme/Variantedc1150be0910f75d208b99938159fa971265563e25e60420e4fe8d7e57bab0b.lean#L620).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0d04853b05049acf9ec8298481993c79c9cab0d4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
