## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a1bd3ad2fbfa08a941a8e30a786a8f7a5b18f0f1e02ef3a56960359685d6a5f9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 91–107.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Category Scheme where
  Hom := Hom
  id X := Hom.mk (𝟙 X.toLocallyRingedSpace)
  comp f g := Hom.mk (f.toLRSHom ≫ g.toLRSHom)

/-- `f ⁻¹ᵁ U` is notation for `(Opens.map f.base).obj U`, the preimage of an open set `U` under `f`.
The preferred name in lemmas is `preimage` and it should be treated as an infix. -/
scoped[AlgebraicGeometry] notation3:90 f:91 " ⁻¹ᵁ " U:90 =>
  @Functor.obj (Scheme.Opens _) _ (Scheme.Opens _) _
    (Opens.map (f : Scheme.Hom _ _).base) U

/-- `Γ(X, U)` is notation for `X.presheaf.obj (op U)`. -/
scoped[AlgebraicGeometry] notation3 "Γ(" X ", " U ")" =>
  (PresheafedSpace.presheaf (SheafedSpace.toPresheafedSpace
    (LocallyRingedSpace.toSheafedSpace (Scheme.toLocallyRingedSpace X)))).obj
    (op (α := Scheme.Opens _) U)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme/Variantfd1eac831f08466b6ede97d7a30cbc30ed0392c8a2a86ad9a38ceeb923e64333.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme/Variantfd1eac831f08466b6ede97d7a30cbc30ed0392c8a2a86ad9a38ceeb923e64333.lean#L91).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b6c4978ca0c6e5ba7b14d3544e5ea590b760d8f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
