## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8b80a1200d6cf1fde5026f2e576fbfc4d9ebda1a88032f703ee12426668721d2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 138–157.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def OpenCover.bind (f : ∀ x : 𝒰.J, OpenCover (𝒰.obj x)) : OpenCover X where
  J := Σ i : 𝒰.J, (f i).J
  obj x := (f x.1).obj x.2
  map x := (f x.1).map x.2 ≫ 𝒰.map x.1
  f x := ⟨_, (f _).f (𝒰.Covers x).choose⟩
  Covers x := by
    let y := (𝒰.Covers x).choose
    have hy : (𝒰.map (𝒰.f x)).val.base y = x := (𝒰.Covers x).choose_spec
    rcases(f (𝒰.f x)).Covers y with ⟨z, hz⟩
    change x ∈ Set.range ((f (𝒰.f x)).map ((f (𝒰.f x)).f y) ≫ 𝒰.map (𝒰.f x)).1.base
    use z
    erw [comp_apply]
    rw [hz, hy]
  -- Porting note : weirdly, even though no input is needed, `inferInstance` does not work
  -- `PresheafedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.comp` is marked as `instance`
  IsOpen x := PresheafedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.comp _ _
#align algebraic_geometry.Scheme.open_cover.bind AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.OpenCover.bind

/-- An isomorphism `X ⟶ Y` is an open cover of `Y`. -/
@[simps J obj map]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme/Variantdc477b2dc3076c58c86caf09e0adae4af5e93ded472e213ceb3d6a3e1651b0a3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme/Variantdc477b2dc3076c58c86caf09e0adae4af5e93ded472e213ceb3d6a3e1651b0a3.lean#L138).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `83eaa0289eaf8fd200ee135abb4e3faa358d9a94` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
