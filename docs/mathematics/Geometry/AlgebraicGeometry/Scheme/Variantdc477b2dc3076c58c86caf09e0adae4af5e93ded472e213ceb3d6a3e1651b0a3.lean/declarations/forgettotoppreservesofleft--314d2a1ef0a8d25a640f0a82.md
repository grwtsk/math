## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d71059e3adeadcaecb7ff592ca7f975d336ee63bd3ad9477abc8dae33f3269c6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 542–551.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance forgetToTopPreservesOfLeft : PreservesLimit (cospan f g) Scheme.forgetToTop := by
  delta Scheme.forgetToTop
  apply @Limits.compPreservesLimit (K := cospan f g) (F := forget)
    (G := LocallyRingedSpace.forgetToTop) ?_ ?_
  · infer_instance
  apply @preservesLimitOfIsoDiagram (F := _) _ _ _ _ _ _ (diagramIsoCospan.{u} _).symm ?_
  dsimp [LocallyRingedSpace.forgetToTop]
  infer_instance
#align algebraic_geometry.IsOpenImmersion.forget_to_Top_preserves_of_left AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.forgetToTopPreservesOfLeft

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme/Variantdc477b2dc3076c58c86caf09e0adae4af5e93ded472e213ceb3d6a3e1651b0a3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme/Variantdc477b2dc3076c58c86caf09e0adae4af5e93ded472e213ceb3d6a3e1651b0a3.lean#L542).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `83eaa0289eaf8fd200ee135abb4e3faa358d9a94` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
