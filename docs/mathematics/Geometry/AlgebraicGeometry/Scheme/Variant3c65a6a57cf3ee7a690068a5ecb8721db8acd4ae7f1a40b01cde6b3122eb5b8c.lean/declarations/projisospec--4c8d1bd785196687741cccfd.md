## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:af705f793ec019b2a119cd44922fea61be552f4ac0a94f743cd05d31802385b2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 855–861.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def projIsoSpec (f) {m} (f_deg : f ∈ 𝒜 m) (hm : 0 < m) :
    (Proj| pbo f) ≅ (Spec (A⁰_ f)) :=
  @asIso _ _ _ _ (f := toSpec 𝒜 f) (isIso_toSpec 𝒜 f f_deg hm)

/--
This is the scheme `Proj(A)` for any `ℕ`-graded ring `A`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme/Variant3c65a6a57cf3ee7a690068a5ecb8721db8acd4ae7f1a40b01cde6b3122eb5b8c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme/Variant3c65a6a57cf3ee7a690068a5ecb8721db8acd4ae7f1a40b01cde6b3122eb5b8c.lean#L855).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c6413c91e5acbaee81d56b987c765cce0d34c551` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
