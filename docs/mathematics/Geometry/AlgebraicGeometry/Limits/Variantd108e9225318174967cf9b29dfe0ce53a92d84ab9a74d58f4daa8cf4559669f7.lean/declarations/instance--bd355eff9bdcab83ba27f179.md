## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:40c294d43c3cefaa9caa36105ff078328a9bef68d16d683f9651a5f04bdb8108`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 685–693.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := low) [Finite X] [DiscreteTopology X] : IsAffine X :=
  have : IsAffineOpen (⨆ (x : X), (⟨{x}, isOpen_discrete _⟩ : X.Opens)) :=
    .iSup_of_disjoint (fun i ↦ .of_subsingleton Set.subsingleton_singleton)
      fun i j e ↦ by simpa [← TopologicalSpace.Opens.coe_disjoint]
  have : IsAffine (⊤ : X.Opens).toScheme := show IsAffineOpen _ by convert! this; ext; simp
  .of_isIso X.topIso.inv

end Coproduct

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Limits/Variantd108e9225318174967cf9b29dfe0ce53a92d84ab9a74d58f4daa8cf4559669f7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Limits/Variantd108e9225318174967cf9b29dfe0ce53a92d84ab9a74d58f4daa8cf4559669f7.lean#L685).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6c5507bcef5900f1cbd60ad35ee429a73aa3f631` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
