## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8d251d56a9dc9bede31c875f807a1f99a6a79c8fcad444c418fe1a9d314b26b7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 545–549.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Γ_restrict_isLocalization (X : Scheme.{u}) [IsAffine X] (r : Scheme.Γ.obj (op X)) :
    IsLocalization.Away r (Scheme.Γ.obj (op <| X.restrict (X.basicOpen r).openEmbedding)) :=
  isLocalization_of_eq_basicOpen _ (topIsAffineOpen X) r (Opens.openEmbedding_obj_top _)
#align algebraic_geometry.Γ_restrict_is_localization AlgebraicGeometry.Γ_restrict_isLocalization

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/AffineScheme/Variant8ae7ff00ceca27aeed5508522683451ddb8ab3b9d3e1cba4ecf6f08ddf675031.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/AffineScheme/Variant8ae7ff00ceca27aeed5508522683451ddb8ab3b9d3e1cba4ecf6f08ddf675031.lean#L545).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `941355433d09b45c53809ac658b279827279d001` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
