## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1b2bf6d8-401d-5be6-adaf-7c32426131a0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 591–606.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  -- Porting note : in the porting note of `Scheme.comp_val_base`, it says that `elementwise` is
  -- unnecessary, indeed, the linter did not like it, so I just use `elementwise_of%` instead of
  -- adding the corresponding lemma in `Scheme.lean` file

-- but after the rewrite, I still can't get it compile under `200000`

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/AffineScheme/Variant8ae7ff00ceca27aeed5508522683451ddb8ab3b9d3e1cba4ecf6f08ddf675031.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/AffineScheme/Variant8ae7ff00ceca27aeed5508522683451ddb8ab3b9d3e1cba4ecf6f08ddf675031.lean#L591).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `941355433d09b45c53809ac658b279827279d001` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
