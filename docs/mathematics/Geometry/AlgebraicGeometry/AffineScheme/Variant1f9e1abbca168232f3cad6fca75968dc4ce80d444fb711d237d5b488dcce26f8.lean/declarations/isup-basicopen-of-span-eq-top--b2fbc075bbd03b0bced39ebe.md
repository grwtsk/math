## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:09ac7d88-6be1-8c49-0a4e-92eab37bf440`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1016–1040.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    exact fun i hi ↦ (Set.inter_subset_right.trans
      (Set.subset_iUnion₂ (s := fun x _ ↦ (X.basicOpen x : Set X)) i hi))

/-- Let `P` be a predicate on the affine open sets of `X` satisfying
1. If `P` holds on `U`, then `P` holds on the basic open set of every section on `U`.
2. If `P` holds for a family of basic open sets covering `U`, then `P` holds for `U`.
3. There exists an affine open cover of `X` each satisfying `P`.

Then `P` holds for every affine open of `X`.

This is also known as the **Affine communication lemma** in [*The rising sea*][RisingSea]. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/AffineScheme/Variant1f9e1abbca168232f3cad6fca75968dc4ce80d444fb711d237d5b488dcce26f8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/AffineScheme/Variant1f9e1abbca168232f3cad6fca75968dc4ce80d444fb711d237d5b488dcce26f8.lean#L1016).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a0305ec46f99a3963a025fcdc52db6af41c9c04` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
