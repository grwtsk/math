## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:768e50f47da9b1797877f1445f3d5112f789a254cf6a102fac4272a53476f373`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 708–717.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Scheme.affineBasicOpen (X : Scheme) {U : X.affineOpens} (f : X.presheaf.obj <| op U) :
    X.affineOpens :=
  ⟨X.basicOpen f, U.prop.basicOpenIsAffine f⟩
#align algebraic_geometry.Scheme.affine_basic_open AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.affineBasicOpen

-- Porting note : linter complains that LHS is not in simp-normal-form. However, the error provided
-- by linter seems to tell me that left hand side should be changed in to something exactly the same
-- as before. I am not sure if this is caused by LHS being written with all explicit argument,
-- I am not sure if this is intentional or not.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/AffineScheme/Variantc4fd828abf57ebc7d79771077be9f958134b02d09465eab972ea121565a68181.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/AffineScheme/Variantc4fd828abf57ebc7d79771077be9f958134b02d09465eab972ea121565a68181.lean#L708).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7419be8a90ea807aa3d0f0926d47c4493835a7a1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
