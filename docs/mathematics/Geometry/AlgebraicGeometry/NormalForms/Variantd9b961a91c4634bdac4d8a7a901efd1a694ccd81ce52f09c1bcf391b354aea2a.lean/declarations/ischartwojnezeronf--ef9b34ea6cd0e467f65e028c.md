## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a60ac749598ccd46429667a006375a4e5e155a12f15cb6942f3ca7c78b79cf20`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 454–463.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class IsCharTwoJNeZeroNF : Prop where
  a₁ : W.a₁ = 1
  a₃ : W.a₃ = 0
  a₄ : W.a₄ = 0

section Quantity

variable [W.IsCharTwoJNeZeroNF]

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/NormalForms/Variantd9b961a91c4634bdac4d8a7a901efd1a694ccd81ce52f09c1bcf391b354aea2a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/NormalForms/Variantd9b961a91c4634bdac4d8a7a901efd1a694ccd81ce52f09c1bcf391b354aea2a.lean#L454).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `07054e09ffb71b29a619f0db2b929ec5ec65532a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
