## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9df45ba413b07faf3ed2d500ec9d720460012d08f643184d2863bfb0e3d956ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 84–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def isFractionPrelocal : PrelocalPredicate fun x : ProjectiveSpectrum.top 𝒜 => at x where
  pred f := IsFraction f
  res := by rintro V U i f ⟨j, r, s, h, w⟩; exact ⟨j, r, s, (h <| i ·), (w <| i ·)⟩

set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency.types false in
/-- We will define the structure sheaf as the subsheaf of all dependent functions in
`Π x : U, HomogeneousLocalization 𝒜 x` consisting of those functions which can locally be expressed
as a ratio of `A` of same grading. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/StructureSheaf/Variant571c045a567f5892708f147b7ba6ea116b277001a41402b7a7d728e313c9190f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/StructureSheaf/Variant571c045a567f5892708f147b7ba6ea116b277001a41402b7a7d728e313c9190f.lean#L84).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8ae40f9026bbd9e9887a89f933432c1b0acab2c9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
