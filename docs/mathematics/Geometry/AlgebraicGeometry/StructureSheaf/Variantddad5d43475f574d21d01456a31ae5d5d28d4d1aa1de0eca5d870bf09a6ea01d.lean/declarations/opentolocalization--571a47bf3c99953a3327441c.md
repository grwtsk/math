## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:900bc8e4711f7abe739f39dc591c14eb8cfeaa0e0d227d28808c488254eb8994`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 269–280.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def openToLocalization (U : Opens (ProjectiveSpectrum.top 𝒜)) (x : ProjectiveSpectrum.top 𝒜)
    (hx : x ∈ U) : (Proj.structureSheaf 𝒜).1.obj (op U) ⟶ CommRingCat.of (at x) where
  toFun s := (s.1 ⟨x, hx⟩ : _)
  map_one' := rfl
  map_mul' _ _ := rfl
  map_zero' := rfl
  map_add' _ _ := rfl
#align algebraic_geometry.open_to_localization AlgebraicGeometry.openToLocalization

/-- The ring homomorphism from the stalk of the structure sheaf of `Proj` at a point corresponding
to a homogeneous prime ideal `x` to the *homogeneous localization* at `x`,
formed by gluing the `openToLocalization` maps. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/StructureSheaf/Variantddad5d43475f574d21d01456a31ae5d5d28d4d1aa1de0eca5d870bf09a6ea01d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/StructureSheaf/Variantddad5d43475f574d21d01456a31ae5d5d28d4d1aa1de0eca5d870bf09a6ea01d.lean#L269).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c12a1efe941e2216f5f2f6721459019d8ee00d7d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
