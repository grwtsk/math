## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fc622b746581fc9945f4eb01be9a3995c8b76fbe7e3db6ed46c837f0ecbcd27d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 299–308.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {R : CommRingCat} [IsNoetherianRing R] :
    IsLocallyNoetherian (Spec R) := by
  apply isLocallyNoetherian_of_affine_cover
    (ι := Fin 1) (S := fun _ => ⟨⊤, isAffineOpen_top (Spec R)⟩)
  · exact iSup_const
  · intro
    apply isNoetherianRing_of_ringEquiv R
    apply CategoryTheory.Iso.commRingCatIsoToRingEquiv
    exact (Scheme.ΓSpecIso R).symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Noetherian/Variantb620b43c2ca7688c8f6a2d4cc7c9c5dc7712b85ec60b0a6ff7ba21af57cc4b08.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Noetherian/Variantb620b43c2ca7688c8f6a2d4cc7c9c5dc7712b85ec60b0a6ff7ba21af57cc4b08.lean#L299).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9ad5d0f006f205a8fd19b802e6f44e577cd60954` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
