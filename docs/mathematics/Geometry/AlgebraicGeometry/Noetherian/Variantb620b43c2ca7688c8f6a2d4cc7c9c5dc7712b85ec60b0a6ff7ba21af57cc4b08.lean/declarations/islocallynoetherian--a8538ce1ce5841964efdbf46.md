## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ad6c6334b92869f71f61f4dcbf7c3cf2ed0a5c30c555176a779657fad30527ce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class IsLocallyNoetherian (X : Scheme) : Prop where
  component_noetherian : ∀ (U : X.affineOpens),
    IsNoetherianRing Γ(X, U) := by infer_instance

section localizationProps

variable {R : Type u} [CommRing R] (S : Finset R) (hS : Ideal.span (α := R) S = ⊤)
  (hN : ∀ s : S, IsNoetherianRing (Away (M := R) s))

include hS hN in
/-- Let `R` be a ring, and `f i` a finite collection of elements of `R` generating the unit ideal.
If the localization of `R` at each `f i` is noetherian, so is `R`.

We follow the proof given in [Har77], Proposition II.3.2 -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Noetherian/Variantb620b43c2ca7688c8f6a2d4cc7c9c5dc7712b85ec60b0a6ff7ba21af57cc4b08.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Noetherian/Variantb620b43c2ca7688c8f6a2d4cc7c9c5dc7712b85ec60b0a6ff7ba21af57cc4b08.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9ad5d0f006f205a8fd19b802e6f44e577cd60954` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
