## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cdbb7703df44ca0655ef207e0d4d9fbc83ea8e53e1d402acae0638ae55dfc4c2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 224–233.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def glueMorphismsOfLocallyDirected (𝒰 : X.OpenCover) [Category* 𝒰.I₀] [𝒰.LocallyDirected]
    {Y : Scheme.{u}}
    (g : ∀ i, 𝒰.X i ⟶ Y) (h : ∀ {i j : 𝒰.I₀} (hij : i ⟶ j), 𝒰.trans hij ≫ g j = g i) :
    X ⟶ Y :=
  𝒰.glueMorphisms g <| fun i j ↦ by
    apply (𝒰.intersectionOfLocallyDirected i j).hom_ext
    intro k
    simp [h]

@[reassoc (attr := simp)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Directed/Variantd8b625065d6a09114578c53fef8ee894c111230ad95fbd6497429343d9e3ccce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Directed/Variantd8b625065d6a09114578c53fef8ee894c111230ad95fbd6497429343d9e3ccce.lean#L224).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `92261c90d0fbb12e437bc43ac8ddb4076f2f47ee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
