## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d640eef7692a2db4dca643c469aa3eec5e6d4296083cb520586ab0fb92212166`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–66.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class LocallyDirected (𝒰 : X.Cover (precoverage P)) [Category* 𝒰.I₀] where
  /-- The transition map `𝒰ᵢ ⟶ 𝒰ⱼ` for `i ≤ j`. -/
  trans {i j : 𝒰.I₀} (hij : i ⟶ j) : 𝒰.X i ⟶ 𝒰.X j
  trans_id (i : 𝒰.I₀) : trans (𝟙 i) = 𝟙 (𝒰.X i) := by cat_disch
  trans_comp {i j k : 𝒰.I₀} (hij : i ⟶ j) (hjk : j ⟶ k) :
    trans (hij ≫ hjk) = trans hij ≫ trans hjk := by cat_disch
  w {i j : 𝒰.I₀} (hij : i ⟶ j) : trans hij ≫ 𝒰.f j = 𝒰.f i := by cat_disch
  directed {i j : 𝒰.I₀} (x : (pullback (𝒰.f i) (𝒰.f j)).carrier) :
    ∃ (k : 𝒰.I₀) (hki : k ⟶ i) (hkj : k ⟶ j) (y : 𝒰.X k),
      pullback.lift (trans hki) (trans hkj) (by simp [w]) y = x
  property_trans {i j : 𝒰.I₀} (hij : i ⟶ j) : P (trans hij) := by infer_instance

variable (𝒰 : X.Cover (precoverage P)) [Category* 𝒰.I₀] [𝒰.LocallyDirected]

/-- The transition maps of a directed cover. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Directed/Variantd8b625065d6a09114578c53fef8ee894c111230ad95fbd6497429343d9e3ccce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Directed/Variantd8b625065d6a09114578c53fef8ee894c111230ad95fbd6497429343d9e3ccce.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `92261c90d0fbb12e437bc43ac8ddb4076f2f47ee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
