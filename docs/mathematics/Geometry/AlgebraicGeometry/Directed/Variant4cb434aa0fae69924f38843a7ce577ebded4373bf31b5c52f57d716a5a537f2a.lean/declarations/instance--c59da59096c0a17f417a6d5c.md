## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f3e4e63f308c2f01732a4248c12d7906acfb369e644c165efef88a3148265fe3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 122–136.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : (𝒰.functorOfLocallyDirected ⋙ Scheme.forget).IsLocallyDirected where
  cond {i j k} fi fj xi xj hxij := by
    simp only [Functor.comp_obj, functorOfLocallyDirected_obj, forget_obj, Functor.comp_map,
      functorOfLocallyDirected_map, forget_map, ConcreteCategory.hom_ofHom,
      TypeCat.Fun.coe_mk] at hxij
    have : 𝒰.f i xi = 𝒰.f j xj := by
      rw [← 𝒰.trans_map fi, ← 𝒰.trans_map fj, Hom.comp_base, Hom.comp_base,
        ConcreteCategory.comp_apply, hxij, ConcreteCategory.comp_apply]
    obtain ⟨z, rfl, rfl⟩ := Scheme.Pullback.exists_preimage_pullback xi xj this
    obtain ⟨l, gi, gj, y, rfl⟩ := 𝒰.exists_lift_trans_eq z
    refine ⟨l, gi, gj, y, ?_, ?_⟩ <;> simp [← Scheme.Hom.comp_apply]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Directed/Variant4cb434aa0fae69924f38843a7ce577ebded4373bf31b5c52f57d716a5a537f2a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Directed/Variant4cb434aa0fae69924f38843a7ce577ebded4373bf31b5c52f57d716a5a537f2a.lean#L122).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bd4cfb063daa86c8271de6f6d6cff27ea478211b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
