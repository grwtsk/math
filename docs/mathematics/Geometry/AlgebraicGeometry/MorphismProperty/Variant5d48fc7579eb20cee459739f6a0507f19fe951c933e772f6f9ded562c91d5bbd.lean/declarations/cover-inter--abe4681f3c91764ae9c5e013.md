## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:76acfa0059885fc2a131844a076c88ccb8b13bba5c4d5a6bbb66f980878bb796`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 264–289.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Cover.inter [P.IsStableUnderBaseChange] [P.IsStableUnderComposition]
    [IsJointlySurjectivePreserving P]
    {X : Scheme.{u}} (𝒰₁ : Scheme.Cover.{v₁} P X)
    (𝒰₂ : Scheme.Cover.{v₂} P X)
    [∀ (i : 𝒰₁.J) (j : 𝒰₂.J), HasPullback (𝒰₁.map i) (𝒰₂.map j)] : X.Cover P where
  J := 𝒰₁.J × 𝒰₂.J
  obj ij := pullback (𝒰₁.map ij.1) (𝒰₂.map ij.2)
  map ij := pullback.fst _ _ ≫ 𝒰₁.map ij.1
  f x := ⟨𝒰₁.f x, 𝒰₂.f x⟩
  covers x := by
    simp only [comp_coeBase, TopCat.coe_comp, Set.mem_range, Function.comp_apply]
    obtain ⟨y₁, hy₁⟩ := 𝒰₁.covers x
    obtain ⟨y₂, hy₂⟩ := 𝒰₂.covers x
    obtain ⟨z, hz⟩ := IsJointlySurjectivePreserving.exists_preimage_fst_triplet_of_prop
      (𝒰₂.map_prop _) y₁ y₂ (by rw [hy₁, hy₂])
    use z
    rw [hz, hy₁]
  map_prop ij := P.comp_mem _ _ (P.pullback_fst _ _ (𝒰₂.map_prop ij.2)) (𝒰₁.map_prop ij.1)

/--
An affine cover of `X` consists of a jointly surjective family of maps into `X` from
spectra of rings.

Note: The `map_prop` field is equipped with a default argument `by infer_instance`. In general
this causes worse error messages, but in practice `P` is mostly defined via `class`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/MorphismProperty/Variant5d48fc7579eb20cee459739f6a0507f19fe951c933e772f6f9ded562c91d5bbd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/MorphismProperty/Variant5d48fc7579eb20cee459739f6a0507f19fe951c933e772f6f9ded562c91d5bbd.lean#L264).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2bef7487fffea6a2e187bffba3447b36efc4a716` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
