## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:97cfbf78e7a1dae011f2d0f91a37c299cd75b3a8688b9cd398d3cb5ba699ad1e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 229–241.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Cover.pullbackCover [P.IsStableUnderBaseChange] [IsJointlySurjectivePreserving P]
    {X W : Scheme.{u}} (𝒰 : X.Cover P) (f : W ⟶ X) [∀ x, HasPullback f (𝒰.map x)] : W.Cover P where
  J := 𝒰.J
  obj x := pullback f (𝒰.map x)
  map _ := pullback.fst _ _
  f x := 𝒰.f (f.base x)
  covers x := by
    obtain ⟨y, hy⟩ := 𝒰.covers (f.base x)
    exact IsJointlySurjectivePreserving.exists_preimage_fst_triplet_of_prop
      (𝒰.map_prop _) x y hy.symm
  map_prop j := P.pullback_fst _ _ (𝒰.map_prop j)

/-- The family of morphisms from the pullback cover to the original cover. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/MorphismProperty/Variantcc78cd7e34cb99de7c3d4e6c7576eed60ec008bbbc2fb5aabc00d594d1cfec47.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/MorphismProperty/Variantcc78cd7e34cb99de7c3d4e6c7576eed60ec008bbbc2fb5aabc00d594d1cfec47.lean#L229).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `714c36ff47e5a20cde528e3faa64725d413221d5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
