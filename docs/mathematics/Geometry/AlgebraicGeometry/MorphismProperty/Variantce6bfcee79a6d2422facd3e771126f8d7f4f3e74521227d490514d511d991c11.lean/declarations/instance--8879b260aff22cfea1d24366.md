## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bcd95a4a34f75ccb2c0b39a9fd8e6b8e5454dcefcf0c4a8bfb0d29ef8e6432df`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 116–123.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : JointlySurjective (precoverage P) where
  exists_eq {X} R := fun ⟨hR, _⟩ x ↦ by
    rw [jointlySurjectivePrecoverage, Presieve.mem_comap_jointlySurjectivePrecoverage_iff] at hR
    obtain ⟨Y, g, hg, heq⟩ := hR x
    use Y, g, hg
    exact heq

/-- Turn a `K`-cover into a `Q`-cover by showing that the components satisfy `Q`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/MorphismProperty/Variantce6bfcee79a6d2422facd3e771126f8d7f4f3e74521227d490514d511d991c11.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/MorphismProperty/Variantce6bfcee79a6d2422facd3e771126f8d7f4f3e74521227d490514d511d991c11.lean#L116).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6747f40d82e02f9e85d0bf84aae3009259a7d2e1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
