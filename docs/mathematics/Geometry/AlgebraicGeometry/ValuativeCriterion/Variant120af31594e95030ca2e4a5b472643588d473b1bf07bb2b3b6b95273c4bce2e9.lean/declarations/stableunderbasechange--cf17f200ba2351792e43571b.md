## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0746ff619ca4c750de53483adcee6171bc813368a0322612e6bcf47c39d73b6d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 193–210.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance stableUnderBaseChange : ValuativeCriterion.Existence.IsStableUnderBaseChange := by
  constructor
  intros Y' X X' Y  Y'_to_Y f X'_to_X f' hP hf commSq
  let commSq' : ValuativeCommSq f :=
  { R := commSq.R
    K := commSq.K
    i₁ := commSq.i₁ ≫ X'_to_X
    i₂ := commSq.i₂ ≫ Y'_to_Y
    commSq := ⟨by simp only [Category.assoc, hP.w, reassoc_of% commSq.commSq.w]⟩ }
  obtain ⟨l₀, hl₁, hl₂⟩ := (hf commSq').exists_lift
  refine ⟨⟨⟨hP.lift l₀ commSq.i₂ (by simp_all only [commSq']), ?_, hP.lift_snd _ _ _⟩⟩⟩
  apply hP.hom_ext
  · simpa
  · simp only [Category.assoc]
    rw [hP.lift_snd]
    rw [commSq.commSq.w]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/ValuativeCriterion/Variant120af31594e95030ca2e4a5b472643588d473b1bf07bb2b3b6b95273c4bce2e9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/ValuativeCriterion/Variant120af31594e95030ca2e4a5b472643588d473b1bf07bb2b3b6b95273c4bce2e9.lean#L193).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3d124f8631d739ffa31a604cb2b42f59e7f7739e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
