## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1c0ec87f-aea8-5735-bf37-42b8eb9adf34`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–129.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isIntegral_appTop_of_universallyClosed (f : X ⟶ Y) [UniversallyClosed f] [IsAffine Y] :
    f.appTop.hom.IsIntegral := by
  have : CompactSpace X := (quasiCompact_over_affine_iff f).mp inferInstance
  have : UniversallyClosed (X.toSpecΓ ≫ Spec.map f.appTop) := by
    rwa [← Scheme.toSpecΓ_naturality,
      MorphismProperty.cancel_right_of_respectsIso (P := @UniversallyClosed)]
  have : UniversallyClosed X.toSpecΓ := .of_comp_of_isSeparated _ (Spec.map f.appTop)
  rw [← IsIntegralHom.SpecMap_iff, IsIntegralHom.iff_universallyClosed_and_isAffineHom]
  exact ⟨.of_comp_surjective X.toSpecΓ _, inferInstance⟩

/-- If `X` is an integral scheme that is universally closed over `Spec K`,
then `Γ(X, ⊤)` is a field. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Proper/Variant050d321b1ed8481fba1579a5265ec41075adb56480ed6e337eaaafb88e59817d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Proper/Variant050d321b1ed8481fba1579a5265ec41075adb56480ed6e337eaaafb88e59817d.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `baeafbdbce3482df261820be04145682b95db171` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
