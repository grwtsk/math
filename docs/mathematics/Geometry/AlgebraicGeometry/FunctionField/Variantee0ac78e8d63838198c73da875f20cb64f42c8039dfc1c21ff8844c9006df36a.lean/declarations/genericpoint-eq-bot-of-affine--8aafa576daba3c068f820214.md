## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c2361e68-c558-3cfd-8b6f-10ddd818df4c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 115–122.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem genericPoint_eq_bot_of_affine (R : CommRingCat) [IsDomain R] :
    genericPoint (Spec R) = (⊥ : PrimeSpectrum R) := by
  apply (genericPoint_spec (Spec R)).eq
  rw [isGenericPoint_def]
  rw [← PrimeSpectrum.zeroLocus_vanishingIdeal_eq_closure, PrimeSpectrum.vanishingIdeal_singleton]
  rw [← PrimeSpectrum.zeroLocus_singleton_zero]
  rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/FunctionField/Variantee0ac78e8d63838198c73da875f20cb64f42c8039dfc1c21ff8844c9006df36a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/FunctionField/Variantee0ac78e8d63838198c73da875f20cb64f42c8039dfc1c21ff8844c9006df36a.lean#L115).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
