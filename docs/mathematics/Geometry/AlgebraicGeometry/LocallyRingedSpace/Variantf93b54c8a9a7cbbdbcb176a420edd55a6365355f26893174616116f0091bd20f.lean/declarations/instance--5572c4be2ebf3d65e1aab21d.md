## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:374a32b09b9943bc3128e170c894796764bcde40ada9dd2540c6d861e087fbd7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 141–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Category LocallyRingedSpace where
  Hom := Hom
  id := id
  comp {X Y Z} f g := comp f g
  comp_id {X Y} f := Hom.ext _ _ <| by simp [comp]
  id_comp {X Y} f := Hom.ext _ _ <| by simp [comp]
  assoc {_ _ _ _} f g h := Hom.ext _ _ <| by simp [comp]

/-- The forgetful functor from `LocallyRingedSpace` to `SheafedSpace CommRing`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/LocallyRingedSpace/Variantf93b54c8a9a7cbbdbcb176a420edd55a6365355f26893174616116f0091bd20f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/LocallyRingedSpace/Variantf93b54c8a9a7cbbdbcb176a420edd55a6365355f26893174616116f0091bd20f.lean#L141).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4367ae2db3a858e4a4f80a2881cc3f3025db1bfd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
