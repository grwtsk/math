## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a03ed39bb1164c67110d46bc29ea4e9df445bd83b32ad4c0c2ddd2aac3f25b2a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 203–220.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def homOfSheafedSpaceHomOfIsIso {X Y : LocallyRingedSpace} (f : X.toSheafedSpace ⟶ Y.toSheafedSpace)
    [IsIso f] : X ⟶ Y :=
  Hom.mk f fun x =>
    -- Here we need to see that the stalk maps are really local ring homomorphisms.
    -- This can be solved by type class inference, because stalk maps of isomorphisms
    -- are isomorphisms and isomorphisms are local ring homomorphisms.
    show IsLocalRingHom (PresheafedSpace.stalkMap (SheafedSpace.forgetToPresheafedSpace.map f) x) by
      infer_instance
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false in
#align algebraic_geometry.LocallyRingedSpace.hom_of_SheafedSpace_hom_of_is_iso AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.homOfSheafedSpaceHomOfIsIso

/-- Given two locally ringed spaces `X` and `Y`, an isomorphism between `X` and `Y` as _sheafed_
spaces can be lifted to an isomorphism `X ⟶ Y` as locally ringed spaces.

This is related to the property that the functor `forget_to_SheafedSpace` reflects isomorphisms.
In fact, it is slightly stronger as we do not require `f` to come from a morphism between
_locally_ ringed spaces.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/LocallyRingedSpace/Variant2bd35d4d278cd1fb1b1626bca09889bc33c6b4e25b30a6b7007dabbd8eb37241.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/LocallyRingedSpace/Variant2bd35d4d278cd1fb1b1626bca09889bc33c6b4e25b30a6b7007dabbd8eb37241.lean#L203).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ce4ea7f71d7dad78c0d01fbceff61dae69d65437` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
