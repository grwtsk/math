## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9d8c1bb4-8df9-154e-50eb-d0f3c28d763c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma universallyClosed_eq_universallySpecializing :
    @UniversallyClosed = (topologically @SpecializingMap).universally ⊓ @QuasiCompact := by
  rw [← universally_eq_iff (P := @QuasiCompact).mpr inferInstance, ← universally_inf]
  apply le_antisymm
  · rw [← universally_eq_iff (P := @UniversallyClosed).mpr inferInstance]
    exact universally_mono fun X Y f H ↦ ⟨f.isClosedMap.specializingMap, inferInstance⟩
  · rw [universallyClosed_eq]
    exact universally_mono fun X Y f ⟨h₁, h₂⟩ ↦ (isClosedMap_iff_specializingMap _).mpr h₁

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/UniversallyClosed/Variant85a53461de7f90095a4cccfe6af4c9aff6234bba07e0b60fc8d6851a00f09c46.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/UniversallyClosed/Variant85a53461de7f90095a4cccfe6af4c9aff6234bba07e0b60fc8d6851a00f09c46.lean#L164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7df3b4c4053e44cc221f97e5efcc05688c48302d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
