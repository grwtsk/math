## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:387a9e910e48b3b0cedbe4c20d302c2b16cd1da7736c417dc2693e508a3b39e0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 676–681.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev toSheafedSpaceGlueData : SheafedSpace.GlueData CommRingCat :=
  { f_open := D.f_open
    toGlueData := 𝖣.mapGlueData forgetToSheafedSpace }
#align algebraic_geometry.LocallyRingedSpace.glue_data.to_SheafedSpace_glue_data AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.toSheafedSpaceGlueData

/-- The gluing as locally ringed spaces is isomorphic to the gluing as ringed spaces. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Gluing/Variant4f3840a53fbd059ed008f8213ddddbfe79b3bd1330c43aea6d609cfbcc17422c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Gluing/Variant4f3840a53fbd059ed008f8213ddddbfe79b3bd1330c43aea6d609cfbcc17422c.lean#L676).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a985a4acd24189fa486ee61ddfb20ac6433bb3b9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
