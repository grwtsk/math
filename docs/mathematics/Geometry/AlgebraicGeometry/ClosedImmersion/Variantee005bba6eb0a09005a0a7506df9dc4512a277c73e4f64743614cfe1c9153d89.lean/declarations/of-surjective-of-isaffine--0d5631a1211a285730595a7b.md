## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a36c2976-a0a5-e7ef-19c2-84b8e7bab132`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 126–136.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma of_surjective_of_isAffine {X Y : Scheme} [IsAffine X] [IsAffine Y] (f : X ⟶ Y)
    (h : Function.Surjective (f.appTop)) : IsClosedImmersion f := by
  rw [MorphismProperty.arrow_mk_iso_iff @IsClosedImmersion (arrowIsoSpecΓOfIsAffine f)]
  apply spec_of_surjective
  exact h

/--
If `f ≫ g` and `g` are closed immersions, then `f` is a closed immersion.
Also see `IsClosedImmersion.of_comp` for the general version
where `g` is only required to be separated.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/ClosedImmersion/Variantee005bba6eb0a09005a0a7506df9dc4512a277c73e4f64743614cfe1c9153d89.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/ClosedImmersion/Variantee005bba6eb0a09005a0a7506df9dc4512a277c73e4f64743614cfe1c9153d89.lean#L126).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5f72643b97e88cc91d65f71d49f4a10b71c21bee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
