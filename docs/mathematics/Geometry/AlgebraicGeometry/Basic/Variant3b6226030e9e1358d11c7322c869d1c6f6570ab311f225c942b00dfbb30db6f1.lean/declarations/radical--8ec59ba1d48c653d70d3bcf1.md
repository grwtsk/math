## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ef1e75807431d6ac3e5744b381e25ebc3fc8ada25221a99bbfd91af12d4cd85f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 412–425.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def radical (I : IdealSheafData X) : IdealSheafData X :=
  mkOfMemSupportIff
  (fun U ↦ (I.ideal U).radical)
  (fun U f ↦
    letI : Algebra Γ(X, U) Γ(X, X.affineBasicOpen f) :=
      (X.presheaf.map (homOfLE (X.basicOpen_le f)).op).hom.toAlgebra
    have : IsLocalization.Away f Γ(X, X.basicOpen f) := U.2.isLocalization_of_eq_basicOpen _ _ rfl
    (IsLocalization.map_radical (.powers f) Γ(X, X.basicOpen f) (I.ideal U)).trans
      congr($(I.map_ideal_basicOpen U f).radical))
  I.supportSet
  (fun U x hx ↦ by
    simp only [mem_supportSet_iff_of_mem hx, SetLike.mem_coe, Scheme.zeroLocus_radical])

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Basic/Variant3b6226030e9e1358d11c7322c869d1c6f6570ab311f225c942b00dfbb30db6f1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Basic/Variant3b6226030e9e1358d11c7322c869d1c6f6570ab311f225c942b00dfbb30db6f1.lean#L412).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f0917130fca86cf11a93191f469396b67259022b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
