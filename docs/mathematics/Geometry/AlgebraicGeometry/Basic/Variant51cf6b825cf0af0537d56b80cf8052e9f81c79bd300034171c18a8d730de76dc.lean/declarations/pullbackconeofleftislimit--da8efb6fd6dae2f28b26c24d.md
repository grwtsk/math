## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:397e4d442a37cb6d20e8b76f9f1377b3dc96d9ffcbadb1371e950fcf9d3fae40`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 495–505.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def pullbackConeOfLeftIsLimit : IsLimit (pullbackConeOfLeft f g) := by
  apply PullbackCone.isLimitAux'
  intro s
  use pullbackConeOfLeftLift f g s
  use pullbackConeOfLeftLift_fst f g s
  use pullbackConeOfLeftLift_snd f g s
  intro m _ h₂
  rw [← cancel_mono (pullbackConeOfLeft f g).snd]
  exact h₂.trans (pullbackConeOfLeftLift_snd f g s).symm
#align algebraic_geometry.PresheafedSpace.is_open_immersion.pullback_cone_of_left_is_limit AlgebraicGeometry.PresheafedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.pullbackConeOfLeftIsLimit

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Basic/Variant51cf6b825cf0af0537d56b80cf8052e9f81c79bd300034171c18a8d730de76dc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Basic/Variant51cf6b825cf0af0537d56b80cf8052e9f81c79bd300034171c18a8d730de76dc.lean#L495).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `22b1569af81b9358ba015aba3f8e97b03c814037` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
