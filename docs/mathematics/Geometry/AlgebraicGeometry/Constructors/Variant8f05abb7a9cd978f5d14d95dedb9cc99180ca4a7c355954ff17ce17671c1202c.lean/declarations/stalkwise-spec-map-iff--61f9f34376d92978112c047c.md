## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8549673f-3451-3a26-74b4-6ff36cca661b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 373–388.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma stalkwise_Spec_map_iff (hP : RingHom.RespectsIso P) {R S : CommRingCat} (φ : R ⟶ S) :
    stalkwise P (Spec.map φ) ↔ ∀ (p : Ideal S) (_ : p.IsPrime),
      P (Localization.localRingHom _ p φ.hom rfl) := by
  have hP' : (RingHom.toMorphismProperty P).RespectsIso :=
    RingHom.toMorphismProperty_respectsIso_iff.mp hP
  trans ∀ (p : PrimeSpectrum S), P (Localization.localRingHom _ p.asIdeal φ.hom rfl)
  · exact forall_congr' fun p ↦
      (RingHom.toMorphismProperty P).arrow_mk_iso_iff (Scheme.arrowStalkMapSpecIso _ _)
  · exact ⟨fun H p hp ↦ H ⟨p, hp⟩, fun H p ↦ H p.1 p.2⟩

end Stalkwise

namespace AffineTargetMorphismProperty

/-- If `P` is local at the target, to show that `P` is stable under base change, it suffices to
check this for base change along a morphism of affine schemes. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Constructors/Variant8f05abb7a9cd978f5d14d95dedb9cc99180ca4a7c355954ff17ce17671c1202c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Constructors/Variant8f05abb7a9cd978f5d14d95dedb9cc99180ca4a7c355954ff17ce17671c1202c.lean#L373).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4a81aaf4b4e62285368bce04e7e98775eb744ca7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
