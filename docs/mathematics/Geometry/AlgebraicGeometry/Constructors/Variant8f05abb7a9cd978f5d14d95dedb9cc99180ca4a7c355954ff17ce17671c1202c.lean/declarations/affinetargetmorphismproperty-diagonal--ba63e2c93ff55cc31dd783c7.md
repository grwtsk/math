## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e98f00b5f068d98036ab7a0a3650de33dcb3a2d27cb50c3d14c6366b828c1d0f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 54–59.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def AffineTargetMorphismProperty.diagonal (P : AffineTargetMorphismProperty) :
    AffineTargetMorphismProperty :=
  fun {X _} f _ =>
    ∀ ⦃U₁ U₂ : Scheme⦄ (f₁ : U₁ ⟶ X) (f₂ : U₂ ⟶ X) [IsAffine U₁] [IsAffine U₂] [IsOpenImmersion f₁]
      [IsOpenImmersion f₂], P (pullback.mapDesc f₁ f₂ f)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Constructors/Variant8f05abb7a9cd978f5d14d95dedb9cc99180ca4a7c355954ff17ce17671c1202c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Constructors/Variant8f05abb7a9cd978f5d14d95dedb9cc99180ca4a7c355954ff17ce17671c1202c.lean#L54).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4a81aaf4b4e62285368bce04e7e98775eb744ca7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
