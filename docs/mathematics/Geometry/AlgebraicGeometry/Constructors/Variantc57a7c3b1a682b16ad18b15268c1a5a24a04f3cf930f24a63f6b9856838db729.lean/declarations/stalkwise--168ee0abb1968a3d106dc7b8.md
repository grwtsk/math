## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:40f8ec01db58e357444e5251205930e996ed9de2c1fec28190faf98e33afff3a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 313–321.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def stalkwise (P : ∀ {R S : Type u} [CommRing R] [CommRing S], (R →+* S) → Prop) :
    MorphismProperty Scheme.{u} :=
  fun _ _ f => ∀ x, P (f.stalkMap x).hom

section Stalkwise

variable {P : ∀ {R S : Type u} [CommRing R] [CommRing S], (R →+* S) → Prop}

/-- If `P` respects isos, then `stalkwise P` respects isos. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Constructors/Variantc57a7c3b1a682b16ad18b15268c1a5a24a04f3cf930f24a63f6b9856838db729.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/AlgebraicGeometry/Constructors/Variantc57a7c3b1a682b16ad18b15268c1a5a24a04f3cf930f24a63f6b9856838db729.lean#L313).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `88bcf15636c887111b8f5d021d3744ed9d486c6a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
