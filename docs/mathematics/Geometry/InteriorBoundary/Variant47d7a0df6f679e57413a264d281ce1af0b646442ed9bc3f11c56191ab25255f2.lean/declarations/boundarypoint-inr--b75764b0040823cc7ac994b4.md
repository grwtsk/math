## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a23b0f43-5955-86ac-07f5-e42068e7d5d2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 578–586.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma boundaryPoint_inr (x : M') (hx : I.IsBoundaryPoint x) :
    I.IsBoundaryPoint (.inr x : M ⊕ M') := by
  rw [I.isBoundaryPoint_iff, extChartAt, ChartedSpace.sum_chartAt_inr]
  dsimp
  rw [Sum.inr_injective.extend_apply (chartAt H x)]
  simpa [I.isBoundaryPoint_iff, extChartAt] using hx

-- Converse to the previous direction: if `x` were not an interior point,
-- it had to be a boundary point, hence `p` were a boundary point also, contradiction.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Geometry/InteriorBoundary/Variant47d7a0df6f679e57413a264d281ce1af0b646442ed9bc3f11c56191ab25255f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/InteriorBoundary/Variant47d7a0df6f679e57413a264d281ce1af0b646442ed9bc3f11c56191ab25255f2.lean#L578).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e1f61359042c76f263993d92092e202eafef5e23` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
