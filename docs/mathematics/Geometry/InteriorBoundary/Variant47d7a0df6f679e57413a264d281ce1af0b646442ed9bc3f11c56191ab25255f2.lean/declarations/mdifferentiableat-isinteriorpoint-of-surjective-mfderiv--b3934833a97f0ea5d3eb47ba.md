## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:00afde73-3255-c05d-7231-ce862d74e1fa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 360–391.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma MDifferentiableAt.isInteriorPoint_of_surjective_mfderiv {f : M → N} {x : M}
    (hf : MDiffAt f x) (hf' : Surjective (mfderiv% f x))
    (hx : I.IsInteriorPoint x) : I'.IsInteriorPoint (f x) := by
  -- Since p-adic manifolds don't have boundary, WLOG `𝕜` is `ℝ` or `ℂ` and `E` is normed over `ℝ`.
  wlog _ : IsRCLikeNormedField 𝕜
  · simp [IsInteriorPoint, I'.range_eq_univ_of_not_isRCLikeNormedField ‹_›]
  let _ := IsRCLikeNormedField.rclike 𝕜
  let _ : NormedSpace ℝ E := NormedSpace.restrictScalars ℝ 𝕜 E
  let _ : NormedSpace ℝ E' := NormedSpace.restrictScalars ℝ 𝕜 E'

  replace hf'' := hf''.restrictScalars ℝ
  /- The lemma is now essentially just `mem_interior_convex_of_surjective_fderiv`: because
  `writtenInExtChartAt I I' x f` is differentiable with surjective differential at `x` over `ℝ` and
  sends a neighbourhood of `x` (the region in which it could be written in the extended charts) to
  a closed convex set with nonempty interior (`I'.range`), it must send `x` to that interior. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Geometry/InteriorBoundary/Variant47d7a0df6f679e57413a264d281ce1af0b646442ed9bc3f11c56191ab25255f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/InteriorBoundary/Variant47d7a0df6f679e57413a264d281ce1af0b646442ed9bc3f11c56191ab25255f2.lean#L360).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
