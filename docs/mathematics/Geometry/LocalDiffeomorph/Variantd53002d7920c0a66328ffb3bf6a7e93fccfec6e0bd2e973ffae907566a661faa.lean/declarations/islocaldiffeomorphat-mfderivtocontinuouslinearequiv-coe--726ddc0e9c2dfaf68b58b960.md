## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:74bbcd49-6ca4-a2f8-3519-573fca45693b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 400–405.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma IsLocalDiffeomorphAt.mfderivToContinuousLinearEquiv_coe
    (hf : IsLocalDiffeomorphAt I J n f x) (hn : 1 ≤ n) :
    hf.mfderivToContinuousLinearEquiv hn = mfderiv I J f x := rfl

/-- Each differential of a `C^n` diffeomorphism of Banach manifolds (`n ≥ 1`)
is a linear equivalence. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Geometry/LocalDiffeomorph/Variantd53002d7920c0a66328ffb3bf6a7e93fccfec6e0bd2e973ffae907566a661faa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/LocalDiffeomorph/Variantd53002d7920c0a66328ffb3bf6a7e93fccfec6e0bd2e973ffae907566a661faa.lean#L400).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6538e9e5b58fcde99c1a27f672228f0f3912f1cb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
