## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:10b644f9a938b65d0aeeb33350896e7db5dac9e3c04058e1ac156fde0be0ffa6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–165.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def trans (Ψ : PartialDiffeomorph J K N P n) : PartialDiffeomorph I K M P n where
  __ := Φ.toOpenPartialHomeomorph.trans Ψ.toOpenPartialHomeomorph
  contMDiffOn_toFun :=
    Ψ.contMDiffOn_toFun.comp (Φ.contMDiffOn_toFun.mono inter_subset_left) inter_subset_right
  contMDiffOn_invFun :=
    Φ.contMDiffOn_invFun.comp (Ψ.contMDiffOn_invFun.mono inter_subset_left) inter_subset_right

/- We could add lots of additional API (following `Diffeomorph` and `OpenPartialHomeomorph`),
such as
* further continuity and differentiability lemmas
* refl and trans instances; lemmas between them.

As this declaration is meant for internal use only, we keep it simple. -/
end PartialDiffeomorph
end PartialDiffeomorph

variable {M N}

/-- `f : M → N` is called a **`C^n` local diffeomorphism at `x`** iff there exist
open sets `U ∋ x` and `V ∋ f x` and a diffeomorphism `Φ : U → V` such that `f = Φ` on `U`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Geometry/LocalDiffeomorph/Variant420f44247af7d00fde4959d9ea557b0f26278033f8a8fe9201dfdce68cf25d0c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/LocalDiffeomorph/Variant420f44247af7d00fde4959d9ea557b0f26278033f8a8fe9201dfdce68cf25d0c.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `da2f771d21560dafda5cfd832d4ce0655565f558` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
