## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e4faf46a-0c2e-55c9-e424-1ea9c66791f7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 275–281.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem vectorSpan_eq_span_vsub_finset_right_ne [DecidableEq P] [DecidableEq V] {s : Finset P}
    {p : P} (hp : p ∈ s) :
    vectorSpan k (s : Set P) = Submodule.span k ((s.erase p).image (· -ᵥ p)) := by
  simp [vectorSpan_eq_span_vsub_set_right_ne _ (Finset.mem_coe.mpr hp)]

/-- The `vectorSpan` of the image of a function is the span of the pairwise subtractions with a
given point on the left, excluding the subtraction of that point from itself. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Basic/Variant35a1e2e6159dc61eee1fa58b2d564bde846827f7d105e6852a5df6d9d73b7c2f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Basic/Variant35a1e2e6159dc61eee1fa58b2d564bde846827f7d105e6852a5df6d9d73b7c2f.lean#L275).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8de1be405ca81df88563402e29d7e86c1fbd5f16` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
