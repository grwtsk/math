## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e8434e1d-6701-ee7a-c172-8fe7970d4a9b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1104–1109.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma wSameSide_affineSpan_faceOpposite_point_right_iff {w : Fin (n + 1) → R}
    (hw : ∑ j, w j = 1) {i : Fin (n + 1)} :
    (affineSpan R (Set.range (s.faceOpposite i).points)).WSameSide
      (Finset.univ.affineCombination R s.points w) (s.points i) ↔ 0 ≤ w i := by
  rw [wSameSide_comm, s.wSameSide_affineSpan_faceOpposite_point_left_iff hw]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Side/Variant5ec498840b0680e5fb43f1ffb9c133c54ae6be318c62bb62caee84082f099d5f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Side/Variant5ec498840b0680e5fb43f1ffb9c133c54ae6be318c62bb62caee84082f099d5f.lean#L1104).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `57630cbda5d143c6bb8150def59664c519757323` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
