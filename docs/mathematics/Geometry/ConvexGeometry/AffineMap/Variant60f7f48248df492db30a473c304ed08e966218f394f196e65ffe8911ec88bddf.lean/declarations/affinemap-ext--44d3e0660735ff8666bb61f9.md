## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4cb1d5c4-a4c1-a7ec-2f02-e826bb7d979e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma affineMap_ext {M : Type*} {Y : Type*} [ConvexSpace R Y]
    {f g : ConvexSpace.AffineMap R (StdSimplex R M) Y}
    (h : ∀ (i : M), f (.single i) = g (.single i)) : f = g := by
  ext x
  conv_lhs => rw [← iConvexComb_single x]
  conv_rhs => rw [← iConvexComb_single x]
  rw [f.isAffineMap.map_iConvexComb, g.isAffineMap.map_iConvexComb]
  aesop

/-- The (bundled) affine map `StdSimplex R M → StdSimplex R N` induced
by a map `f : M → N`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/AffineMap/Variant60f7f48248df492db30a473c304ed08e966218f394f196e65ffe8911ec88bddf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/AffineMap/Variant60f7f48248df492db30a473c304ed08e966218f394f196e65ffe8911ec88bddf.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `36febc9752899d9e3f36d76e25423bc15e4a20b7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
