## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4af00385ad5ac4995716b5ff556dddef70598045af39097ed785c30692047b79`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 136–143.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def stdSimplexEquivIcc : stdSimplex 𝕜 (Fin 2) ≃ Icc (0 : 𝕜) 1 where
  toFun f := ⟨f.1 1, f.2.1 _, f.2.2 ▸
    Finset.single_le_sum (fun i _ ↦ f.2.1 i) (Finset.mem_univ _)⟩
  invFun x := ⟨![1 - x, x], Fin.forall_fin_two.2 ⟨sub_nonneg.2 x.2.2, x.2.1⟩, by simp⟩
  left_inv f := Subtype.ext <| funext <| Fin.forall_fin_two.2 <| by
    simp [← (show f.1 0 + f.1 1 = 1 by simpa using f.2.2)]

@[simp, deprecated StdSimplex.equivIcc_single_zero (since := "2026-08-29")]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/StdSimplex/Variantf23c7840d663e652cba4edd86aababf65351c7aca75b73de6e977292c1782fff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/StdSimplex/Variantf23c7840d663e652cba4edd86aababf65351c7aca75b73de6e977292c1782fff.lean#L136).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `80a743ee6440d4b3e08ce22f3a84194fedda4cb6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
