## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:93e4a039-0af7-939d-b20a-24e25a0d84ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 898–903.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem direction_iInf_of_mem_iInf (s : ι → AffineSubspace k P) (p : P) (h : p ∈ iInf s) :
    (iInf s).direction = ⨅ i, (s i).direction := by
  rw [iInf, direction_sInf_of_mem_sInf _ p h, iInf_range]

/-- If one affine subspace is less than or equal to another, the same applies to their
directions. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Defs/Variantfe296f41d929f723f8bc21d7dc324bb5e52fd17aad5b9b68869bc58d2fa92c74.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Defs/Variantfe296f41d929f723f8bc21d7dc324bb5e52fd17aad5b9b68869bc58d2fa92c74.lean#L898).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `28f186245aab4571bac1ccc537c76c90f7a9befe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
