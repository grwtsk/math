## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5c209529-ef77-9006-2e41-02e32eeb7f3c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 843–852.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem AffineIndependent.not_wbtw_of_injective {ι} (i j k : ι)
    (h : Function.Injective ![i, j, k]) {T : ι → P} (hT : AffineIndependent R T) :
    ¬ Wbtw R (T i) (T j) (T k) := by
  replace hT := hT.comp_embedding ⟨_, h⟩
  rw [affineIndependent_iff_not_collinear] at hT
  contrapose! hT
  simp [Set.range_comp, Set.image_insert_eq, hT.symm.collinear]

variable (R)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Between/Variantd94c4a4dea8404f3d94b25de77bb6ea9c31b1442fa62b3f5011c3bcc3dce4f34.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Between/Variantd94c4a4dea8404f3d94b25de77bb6ea9c31b1442fa62b3f5011c3bcc3dce4f34.lean#L843).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0f5ed38000e915ffae35dabc0c1d8ab94a74909b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
