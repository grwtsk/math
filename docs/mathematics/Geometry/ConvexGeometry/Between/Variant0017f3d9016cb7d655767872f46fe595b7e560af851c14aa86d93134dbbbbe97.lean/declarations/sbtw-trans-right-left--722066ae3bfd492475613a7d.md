## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8f2a74d6-7d6d-6f38-3325-ba9a91f4cac2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1012–1015.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Sbtw.trans_right_left {w x y z : P} (h₁ : Sbtw R w x z) (h₂ : Sbtw R x y z) :
    Sbtw R w x y :=
  ⟨h₁.wbtw.trans_right_left h₂.wbtw, h₁.ne_left, h₂.left_ne⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Between/Variant0017f3d9016cb7d655767872f46fe595b7e560af851c14aa86d93134dbbbbe97.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Between/Variant0017f3d9016cb7d655767872f46fe595b7e560af851c14aa86d93134dbbbbe97.lean#L1012).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `355f6d168937263c79e43098d714e32961142d15` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
