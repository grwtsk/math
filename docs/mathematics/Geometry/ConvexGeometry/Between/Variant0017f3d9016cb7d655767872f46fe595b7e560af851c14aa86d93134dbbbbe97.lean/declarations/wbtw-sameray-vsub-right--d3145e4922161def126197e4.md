## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d5a5e2c3-fa99-42a8-2dae-e3c964d84f6e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 752–766.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Wbtw.sameRay_vsub_right {x y z : P} (h : Wbtw R x y z) : SameRay R (z -ᵥ x) (z -ᵥ y) := by
  rcases h with ⟨t, ⟨_, ht1⟩, rfl⟩
  simp [SameRay.sameRay_nonneg_smul_right (z -ᵥ x) (sub_nonneg.2 ht1)]

end StrictOrderedCommRing

section LinearOrderedRing

variable [Ring R] [LinearOrder R] [IsStrictOrderedRing R]
  [AddCommGroup V] [Module R V] [AddTorsor V P]
variable {R}

/-- Suppose lines from two vertices of a triangle to interior points of the opposite side meet at
`p`. Then `p` lies in the interior of the first (and by symmetry the other) segment from a
vertex to the point on the opposite side. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Between/Variant0017f3d9016cb7d655767872f46fe595b7e560af851c14aa86d93134dbbbbe97.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Between/Variant0017f3d9016cb7d655767872f46fe595b7e560af851c14aa86d93134dbbbbe97.lean#L752).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `355f6d168937263c79e43098d714e32961142d15` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
