## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:df88f9dc-4b2c-48ca-47ef-19917d5edc0c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 339–351.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma inner_vsub_vsub_altitudeFoot_eq_height_sq [NeZero n] {i j : Fin (n + 1)} (h : i ≠ j) :
    ⟪s.points i -ᵥ s.points j, s.points i -ᵥ s.altitudeFoot i⟫ = s.height i ^ 2 := by
  suffices ⟪s.points j -ᵥ s.altitudeFoot i, s.points i -ᵥ s.altitudeFoot i⟫ = 0 by
    rwa [height, inner_vsub_vsub_left_eq_dist_sq_right_iff, inner_vsub_left_eq_zero_symm]
  exact s.inner_vsub_altitudeFoot_vsub_altitudeFoot_eq_zero h

variable [Nat.AtLeastTwo n]

/--
The inner product of two distinct altitudes has absolute value strictly less than the product of
their lengths.

Equivalently, neither vector is a multiple of the other; the angle between them is not 0 or π. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Altitude/Variantbd2889cf801c21fdd871cfa6c676c03973cb0361af6cf7ad2aab0e336cb5e333.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Altitude/Variantbd2889cf801c21fdd871cfa6c676c03973cb0361af6cf7ad2aab0e336cb5e333.lean#L339).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a1aa69771aa82b62f207e19c9fcdc09fd48e6eb0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
