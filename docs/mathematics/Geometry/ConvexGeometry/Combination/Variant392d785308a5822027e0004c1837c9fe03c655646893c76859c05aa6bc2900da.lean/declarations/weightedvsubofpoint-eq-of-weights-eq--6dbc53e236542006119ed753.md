## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e66e4e25-10d1-7cde-ca65-5015a7e4db64`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 104–115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem weightedVSubOfPoint_eq_of_weights_eq (p : ι → P) (j : ι) (w₁ w₂ : ι → k)
    (hw : ∀ i, i ≠ j → w₁ i = w₂ i) :
    s.weightedVSubOfPoint p (p j) w₁ = s.weightedVSubOfPoint p (p j) w₂ := by
  simp only [Finset.weightedVSubOfPoint_apply]
  congr
  ext i
  rcases eq_or_ne i j with h | h
  · simp [h]
  · simp [hw i h]

/-- The weighted sum is independent of the base point when the sum of
the weights is 0. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Combination/Variant392d785308a5822027e0004c1837c9fe03c655646893c76859c05aa6bc2900da.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Combination/Variant392d785308a5822027e0004c1837c9fe03c655646893c76859c05aa6bc2900da.lean#L104).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `065af88e6049f15a6c0c15394f42a0a8b9bfbd6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
