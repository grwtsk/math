## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a286915705d370909f1647d50f5367b77c470e49ce95c5a77cf4b13a6f015e2c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 240–248.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def weightedVSub (p : ι → P) : (ι → k) →ₗ[k] V :=
  s.weightedVSubOfPoint p (Classical.choice S.nonempty)

/-- Applying `weightedVSub` with given weights.  This is for the case
where a result involving a default base point is OK (for example, when
that base point will cancel out later); a more typical use case for
`weightedVSub` would involve selecting a preferred base point with
`weightedVSub_eq_weightedVSubOfPoint_of_sum_eq_zero` and then
using `weightedVSubOfPoint_apply`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Combination/Variant7db45192454a0e821487714528ea347590c9c72bdd69cccf66ca5c512b315538.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ConvexGeometry/Combination/Variant7db45192454a0e821487714528ea347590c9c72bdd69cccf66ca5c512b315538.lean#L240).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9e798f2a5c14388cabd43258ee0338100eccf051` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
