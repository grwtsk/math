## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5e92f117116de96246f8a6588fda1b0ae4b340112cfbbd11408405e9086f3fac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 564–571.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (G : C ⥤ D) [G.Additive] :
    (G.mapHomotopyCategory (ComplexShape.up ℤ)).IsTriangulated where
  map_distinguished := by
    rintro T ⟨K, L, f, ⟨e⟩⟩
    exact ⟨_, _, _, ⟨(G.mapHomotopyCategory (ComplexShape.up ℤ)).mapTriangle.mapIso e ≪≫
      CochainComplex.mappingCone.mapTrianglehIso f G⟩⟩

end HomotopyCategory
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Pretriangulated/Varianta31ba61dd5c362c61c44a5fa4d9cc1f100dd0967cbf6ff1040423d72b49d13dd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Pretriangulated/Varianta31ba61dd5c362c61c44a5fa4d9cc1f100dd0967cbf6ff1040423d72b49d13dd.lean#L564).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f717c56b307f453a9753554abd9725284f07413a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
