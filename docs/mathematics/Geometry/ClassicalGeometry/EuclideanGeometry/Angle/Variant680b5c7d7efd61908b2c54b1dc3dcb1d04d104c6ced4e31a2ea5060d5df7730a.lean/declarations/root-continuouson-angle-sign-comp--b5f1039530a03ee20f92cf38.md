## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:871c781c-5d6f-2f67-5e6d-c751f23774d6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 947–955.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem _root_.ContinuousOn.angle_sign_comp {α : Type*} [TopologicalSpace α] {f : α → Angle}
    {s : Set α} (hf : ContinuousOn f s) (hs : ∀ z ∈ s, f z ≠ 0 ∧ f z ≠ π) :
    ContinuousOn (sign ∘ f) s := by
  refine (continuousOn_of_forall_continuousAt fun θ hθ => ?_).comp hf (Set.mapsTo_image f s)
  obtain ⟨z, hz, rfl⟩ := hθ
  exact continuousAt_sign (hs _ hz).1 (hs _ hz).2

/-- Suppose a function to angles is continuous on a connected set and never takes the values `0`
or `π` on that set. Then the values of the function on that set all have the same sign. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Angle/Variant680b5c7d7efd61908b2c54b1dc3dcb1d04d104c6ced4e31a2ea5060d5df7730a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Angle/Variant680b5c7d7efd61908b2c54b1dc3dcb1d04d104c6ced4e31a2ea5060d5df7730a.lean#L947).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `815f53c00815218f96f6ae5af380b3feb4a51f42` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
