## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cd5bde1a-14ad-d383-cdee-749267a7368e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 806–809.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_iff_abs_toReal_eq_of_sign_eq {θ ψ : Angle} (h : θ.sign = ψ.sign) :
    θ = ψ ↔ |θ.toReal| = |ψ.toReal| := by simpa [h] using @eq_iff_sign_eq_and_abs_toReal_eq θ ψ

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Angle/Variant77e5f8f310cce7f5f847661fbb7b65cc1165a9c2ae308a2b23f23bb2e9d89a0c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Angle/Variant77e5f8f310cce7f5f847661fbb7b65cc1165a9c2ae308a2b23f23bb2e9d89a0c.lean#L806).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `358d8e29b4a6099451b07372ffb0d5827c3a2e6f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
