## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:00491801-40a5-5c88-c186-2eae2497c9a1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 702–709.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tan_eq_inv_of_two_zsmul_add_two_zsmul_eq_pi {θ ψ : Angle}
    (h : (2 : ℤ) • θ + (2 : ℤ) • ψ = π) : tan ψ = (tan θ)⁻¹ := by
  simp_rw [two_zsmul, ← two_nsmul] at h
  exact tan_eq_inv_of_two_nsmul_add_two_nsmul_eq_pi h

/-- The sign of a `Real.Angle` is `0` if the angle is `0` or `π`, `1` if the angle is strictly
between `0` and `π` and `-1` is the angle is strictly between `-π` and `0`. It is defined as the
sign of the sine of the angle. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Angle/Variant77e5f8f310cce7f5f847661fbb7b65cc1165a9c2ae308a2b23f23bb2e9d89a0c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Angle/Variant77e5f8f310cce7f5f847661fbb7b65cc1165a9c2ae308a2b23f23bb2e9d89a0c.lean#L702).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `358d8e29b4a6099451b07372ffb0d5827c3a2e6f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
