## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7662d1d6-2a4a-c627-b0e5-a8c8e1837880`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 202–217.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem confluent {a b c : Expr S} (hab : Reduces a b) (hac : Reduces a c) :
    Relation.Join Reduces b c := by
  have hd : ∀ a b c : Expr S, Parallel a b → Parallel a c →
      ∃ d, Relation.ReflGen Parallel b d ∧ Relation.ReflTransGen Parallel c d := by
    intro a b c hab hac
    obtain ⟨d, hb, hc⟩ := Parallel.diamond hab hac
    exact ⟨d, .single hb, .single hc⟩
  obtain ⟨d, hb, hc⟩ := Relation.church_rosser hd hab.parallel hac.parallel
  exact ⟨d, Parallel.rtc_reduces hb, Parallel.rtc_reduces hc⟩

end Reduces

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Reduction/Variantd47725d4b4830fd67e4494c7be98023127d10c36ac197dac3d23a27a387165d5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Reduction/Variantd47725d4b4830fd67e4494c7be98023127d10c36ac197dac3d23a27a387165d5.lean#L202).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f07128c1bc673a98772c5399d33e01900aaeeeec` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
