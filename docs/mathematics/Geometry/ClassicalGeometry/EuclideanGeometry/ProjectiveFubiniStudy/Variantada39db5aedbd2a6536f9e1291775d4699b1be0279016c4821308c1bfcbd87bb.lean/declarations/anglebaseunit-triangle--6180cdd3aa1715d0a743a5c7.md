## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:73d2e718-6c38-d5b1-3808-04064f92eae7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 455–468.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem angleBaseUnit_triangle (x y z : H)
    (hx : ‖x‖ = 1) (hy : ‖y‖ = 1) (hz : ‖z‖ = 1) :
    angleBaseUnit x z ≤ angleBaseUnit x y + angleBaseUnit y z := by
  apply arccos_triangle_bound
  · exact ⟨norm_nonneg _, by simpa [hx, hy] using norm_inner_le_norm x y⟩
  · exact ⟨norm_nonneg _, by simpa [hy, hz] using norm_inner_le_norm y z⟩
  · exact ⟨norm_nonneg _, by simpa [hx, hz] using norm_inner_le_norm x z⟩
  · exact overlap_lower_bound x y z hx hy hz

The complete manuscript route: normalize three nonzero representatives, apply
the complex remainder bound, then cross the isolated real `arccos` bridge.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/ProjectiveFubiniStudy/Variantada39db5aedbd2a6536f9e1291775d4699b1be0279016c4821308c1bfcbd87bb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/ProjectiveFubiniStudy/Variantada39db5aedbd2a6536f9e1291775d4699b1be0279016c4821308c1bfcbd87bb.lean#L455).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4207bbba730394f2666283dd79c9bc3e3b0175af` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
