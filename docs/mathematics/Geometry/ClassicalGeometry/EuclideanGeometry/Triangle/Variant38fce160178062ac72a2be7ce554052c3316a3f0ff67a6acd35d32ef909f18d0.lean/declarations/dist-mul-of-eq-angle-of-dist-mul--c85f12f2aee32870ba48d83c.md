## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0b698061-3cca-9a7e-a842-cfa0898fa347`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 346–364.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dist_mul_of_eq_angle_of_dist_mul (a b c a' b' c' : P) (r : ℝ) (h : ∠ a' b' c' = ∠ a b c)
    (hab : dist a' b' = r * dist a b) (hcb : dist c' b' = r * dist c b) :
    dist a' c' = r * dist a c := by
  have h' : dist a' c' ^ 2 = (r * dist a c) ^ 2 := calc
    dist a' c' ^ 2 =
        dist a' b' ^ 2 + dist c' b' ^ 2 - 2 * dist a' b' * dist c' b' * Real.cos (∠ a' b' c') := by
      simp [pow_two, law_cos a' b' c']
    _ = r ^ 2 * (dist a b ^ 2 + dist c b ^ 2 - 2 * dist a b * dist c b * Real.cos (∠ a b c)) := by
      rw [h, hab, hcb]; ring
    _ = (r * dist a c) ^ 2 := by simp [pow_two, ← law_cos a b c, mul_pow]; ring
  by_cases hab₁ : a = b
  · have hab'₁ : a' = b' := by
      rw [← dist_eq_zero, hab, dist_eq_zero.mpr hab₁, mul_zero r]
    rw [hab₁, hab'₁, dist_comm b' c', dist_comm b c, hcb]
  · have h1 : 0 ≤ r * dist a b := by rw [← hab]; exact dist_nonneg
    have h2 : 0 ≤ r := nonneg_of_mul_nonneg_left h1 (dist_pos.mpr hab₁)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Triangle/Variant38fce160178062ac72a2be7ce554052c3316a3f0ff67a6acd35d32ef909f18d0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Triangle/Variant38fce160178062ac72a2be7ce554052c3316a3f0ff67a6acd35d32ef909f18d0.lean#L346).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9f5af3e36fc48a921dd30654ba14f7f7c74e37c8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
