## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2443a19b-4776-7dbd-bb88-6ce20b36bf2d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 489–494.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem symm_triangleQPA₂ : cfg.symm.triangleQPA₂ = cfg.trianglePQB₂ := by
  simp_rw [trianglePQB₂, ← symm_A₂]; ext i; fin_cases i <;> rfl
#align imo2019_q2.imo2019q2_cfg.symm_triangle_QPA₂ Imo2019Q2.Imo2019q2Cfg.symm_triangleQPA₂

/-- `ω` is the circle containing `Q`, `P` and `A₂`, which will be shown also to contain `B₂`,
`P₁` and `Q₁`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Imo2019Q2/Variant21e5884a8103874b68a602375dbd624f6811efc9e5b8ef36752ae39a5b3a3098.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Imo2019Q2/Variant21e5884a8103874b68a602375dbd624f6811efc9e5b8ef36752ae39a5b3a3098.lean#L489).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27c0eb9c1027f1e9bff516e2080fc5831940b68f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
