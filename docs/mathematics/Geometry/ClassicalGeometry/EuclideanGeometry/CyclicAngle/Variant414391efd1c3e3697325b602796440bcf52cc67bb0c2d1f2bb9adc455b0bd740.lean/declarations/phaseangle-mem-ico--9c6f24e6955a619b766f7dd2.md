## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:26ee96d5-d846-5703-f6a5-6176d540982a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 124–139.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem phaseAngle_mem_Ico (t : NormalizedPhase) :
    phaseAngle t.value ∈ Set.Ico (0 : ℝ) (2 * Real.pi) := by
  constructor
  · exact mul_nonneg Real.two_pi_pos.le t.nonnegative
  · simpa only [phaseAngle, mul_one] using
      (mul_lt_mul_of_pos_left t.lt_one Real.two_pi_pos)

/-! ## The signed `Real.Angle.toReal` coordinate cut -/

/--
On the first closed half-turn, the signed representative chosen by
`Real.Angle.toReal` is the nonnegative radian lift itself.  The endpoint is
included because `toReal` uses the interval `(-π, π]`, so the half-turn is
represented by `π`, not `-π`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/CyclicAngle/Variant414391efd1c3e3697325b602796440bcf52cc67bb0c2d1f2bb9adc455b0bd740.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/CyclicAngle/Variant414391efd1c3e3697325b602796440bcf52cc67bb0c2d1f2bb9adc455b0bd740.lean#L124).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4a50b2dab904b3e3b14d8795ff736e9b3b7609b5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
