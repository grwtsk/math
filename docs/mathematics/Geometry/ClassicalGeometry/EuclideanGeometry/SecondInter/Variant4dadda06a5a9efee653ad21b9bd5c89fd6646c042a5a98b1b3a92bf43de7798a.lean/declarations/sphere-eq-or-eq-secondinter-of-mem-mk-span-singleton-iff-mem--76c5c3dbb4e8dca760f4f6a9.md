## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f75c78df-7f8d-31c9-6eca-0bcc023665e7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 98–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (hp : p ∈ s) {v : V} {p' : P} (hp' : p' ∈ AffineSubspace.mk' p (ℝ ∙ v)) :

  · rw [AffineSubspace.mem_mk', Submodule.mem_span_singleton] at hp'
    rcases hp' with ⟨r, hr⟩

    rw [mem_sphere] at h hp
    rw [← hp, dist_smul_vadd_eq_dist _ _ hv] at h
    rcases h with (h | h) <;> simp [h]

/-- A point on a line through a point on a sphere and a second point equals that point or
`secondInter`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/SecondInter/Variant4dadda06a5a9efee653ad21b9bd5c89fd6646c042a5a98b1b3a92bf43de7798a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/SecondInter/Variant4dadda06a5a9efee653ad21b9bd5c89fd6646c042a5a98b1b3a92bf43de7798a.lean#L98).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `17357bc467861633668a58b9444d8d0914cb8004` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
