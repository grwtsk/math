## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:df71495c-041b-f9ef-6544-4ac6823b1545`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 591–598.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem sin_oangle_right_of_oangle_eq_pi_div_two {p₁ p₂ p₃ : P} (h : ∡ p₁ p₂ p₃ = ↑(π / 2)) :
    Real.Angle.sin (∡ p₂ p₃ p₁) = dist p₁ p₂ / dist p₁ p₃ := by
  have hs : (∡ p₂ p₃ p₁).sign = 1 := by rw [oangle_rotate_sign, h, Real.Angle.sign_coe_pi_div_two]

      (Or.inl (left_ne_of_oangle_eq_pi_div_two h))]

/-- The sine of an angle in a right-angled triangle as a ratio of sides. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/RightAngle/Variantc206bdd73cadc0ddb5a2405dcfca544b1d581b1046cf86e8120840b80b0a3429.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/RightAngle/Variantc206bdd73cadc0ddb5a2405dcfca544b1d581b1046cf86e8120840b80b0a3429.lean#L591).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8ca1f21c9b8128a1645700549e1243f412dc15da` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
