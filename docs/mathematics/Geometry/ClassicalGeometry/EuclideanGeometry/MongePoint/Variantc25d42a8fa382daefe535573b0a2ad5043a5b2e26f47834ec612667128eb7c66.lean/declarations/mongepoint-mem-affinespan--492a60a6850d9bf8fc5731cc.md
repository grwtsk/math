## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:969b01da-e529-c260-4ef0-539c33322cdd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 128–133.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mongePoint_mem_affineSpan {n : ℕ} (s : Simplex ℝ P n) :
    s.mongePoint ∈ affineSpan ℝ (Set.range s.points) :=
  smul_vsub_vadd_mem _ _ (centroid_mem_affineSpan_of_card_eq_add_one ℝ _ (card_fin (n + 1)))
    s.circumcenter_mem_affineSpan s.circumcenter_mem_affineSpan

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/MongePoint/Variantc25d42a8fa382daefe535573b0a2ad5043a5b2e26f47834ec612667128eb7c66.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/MongePoint/Variantc25d42a8fa382daefe535573b0a2ad5043a5b2e26f47834ec612667128eb7c66.lean#L128).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
