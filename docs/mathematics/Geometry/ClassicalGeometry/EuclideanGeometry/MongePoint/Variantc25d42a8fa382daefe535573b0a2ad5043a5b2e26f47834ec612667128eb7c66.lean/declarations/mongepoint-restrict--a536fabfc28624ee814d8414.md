## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fc4ae1b0-ea5c-97e2-9675-0e2cbe7b4f6d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 134–143.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mongePoint_restrict {n : ℕ} (s : Simplex ℝ P n) (S : AffineSubspace ℝ P)
    (hS : affineSpan ℝ (Set.range s.points) ≤ S) :
    haveI := Nonempty.map (AffineSubspace.inclusion hS) inferInstance
    (s.restrict S hS).mongePoint = s.mongePoint := by
  have := Nonempty.map (AffineSubspace.inclusion hS) inferInstance
  simp_rw [mongePoint]
  rw [← Simplex.centroid, ← Simplex.centroid]
  simp [centroid_restrict, circumcenter_restrict]

/-- Two simplices with the same points have the same Monge point. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/MongePoint/Variantc25d42a8fa382daefe535573b0a2ad5043a5b2e26f47834ec612667128eb7c66.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/MongePoint/Variantc25d42a8fa382daefe535573b0a2ad5043a5b2e26f47834ec612667128eb7c66.lean#L134).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f582cc6d4efac0da3198e0b3cbe489bfc5611cb1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
