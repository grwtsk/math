## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:da80958a-9c71-1b71-1d1d-46f1af5469e0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–50.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sin_arg (x : ℂ) : Real.sin (arg x) = x.im / abs x := by
  unfold arg; split_ifs <;>
    simp [sub_eq_add_neg, arg,
      Real.sin_arcsin (abs_le.1 (abs_im_div_abs_le_one x)).1 (abs_le.1 (abs_im_div_abs_le_one x)).2,
      Real.sin_add, neg_div, Real.arcsin_neg, Real.sin_neg]
#align complex.sin_arg Complex.sin_arg

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Arg/Variant4ad415c48f9aa21658cf4d413c329961436d4dd8c2ba5a4e338119c81ee21112.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Arg/Variant4ad415c48f9aa21658cf4d413c329961436d4dd8c2ba5a4e338119c81ee21112.lean#L44).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e9b724a5695ccbff3bee2b92c43adb9ed80fa7ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
