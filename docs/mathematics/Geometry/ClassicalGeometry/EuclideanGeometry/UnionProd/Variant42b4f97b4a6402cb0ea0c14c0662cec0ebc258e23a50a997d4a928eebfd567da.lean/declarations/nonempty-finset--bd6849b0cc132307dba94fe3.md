## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c60dc9eb-b95e-eb57-ab52-8bac3228e138`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 137–143.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma nonempty_finset : (finset x hd).Nonempty := by
  obtain ⟨i, hi⟩ := mem_range_left x hd k.succ (by grind)
  exact ⟨i, by simpa using hi⟩

/-- Let `x` be a nondegenerate `d`-simplex of `Δ[m + 1] ⊗ Δ[n]` which
does not belong to `Λ[m + 1, k.castSucc].unionProd ∂Δ[n]`. This is
the smallest `l : Fin (d + 1)` such that `x l` is of the form `(k.succ, _)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/UnionProd/Variant42b4f97b4a6402cb0ea0c14c0662cec0ebc258e23a50a997d4a928eebfd567da.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/UnionProd/Variant42b4f97b4a6402cb0ea0c14c0662cec0ebc258e23a50a997d4a928eebfd567da.lean#L137).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a6de4130ba70cbcf0f16344e81638b7f98613c9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
