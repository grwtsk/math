## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b61f5116-be97-13d2-3829-28481ecb9c72`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 220–233.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem fixture_not_pfFour : ¬ PFOrder 4 (Quadratic.coefficient (3 / 2) 1) := by
  intro h
  let r : Fin 4 ↪o ℕ := OrderEmbedding.ofStrictMono (fun i => i.val) (fun _ _ hij => hij)
  let c : Fin 4 ↪o ℕ := OrderEmbedding.ofStrictMono (fun i => i.val + 1)
    (by intro i j hij; exact Nat.add_lt_add_right hij 1)
  have hn := h 4 le_rfl r c
  change 0 ≤ minor (Quadratic.coefficient (3 / 2) 1)
    (fun i : Fin 4 => i.val) (fun i : Fin 4 => i.val + 1) at hn
  rw [fixture_negative_orderFour] at hn
  norm_num at hn

end

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Sector/Variantb3595259792460e02af90aa00c22145dab6a646261b7b0061ced9828afcff6da.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Sector/Variantb3595259792460e02af90aa00c22145dab6a646261b7b0061ced9828afcff6da.lean#L220).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cb9d7be2cf37d2007777bd4522afa6ca9242d437` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
