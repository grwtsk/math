## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c496384b-7de5-4f90-cf6e-286c5b5a25ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 182–190.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem product_pfOrder (R : ℕ) (fs : List Factor)
    (h : ∀ f ∈ fs, f.Admissible R) : PFOrder R (productCoefficient fs) := by
  induction fs with
  | nil => exact (Quadratic.linear_pfInfinity 0 le_rfl).pfOrder R
  | cons f fs ih =>
    exact (f.pfOrder R (h f (by simp))).convolution
      (ih (fun g hg => h g (by simp [hg])))

/-- The limit theorem requires equality with the ACTUAL target coefficient sequence. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Sector/Variantb3595259792460e02af90aa00c22145dab6a646261b7b0061ced9828afcff6da.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Sector/Variantb3595259792460e02af90aa00c22145dab6a646261b7b0061ced9828afcff6da.lean#L182).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cb9d7be2cf37d2007777bd4522afa6ca9242d437` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
