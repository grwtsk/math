## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5a50feda-8da1-afd5-fe58-c55cd01624a5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 379–390.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dist_eq_iff_dist_orthogonalProjection_eq {s : AffineSubspace 𝕜 P} [Nonempty s]
    [s.direction.HasOrthogonalProjection] {p₁ p₂ : P} (p₃ : P) (hp₁ : p₁ ∈ s) (hp₂ : p₂ ∈ s) :
    dist p₁ p₃ = dist p₂ p₃ ↔
      dist p₁ (orthogonalProjection s p₃) = dist p₂ (orthogonalProjection s p₃) := by
  rw [← mul_self_inj_of_nonneg dist_nonneg dist_nonneg, ←
    mul_self_inj_of_nonneg dist_nonneg dist_nonneg,
    dist_sq_eq_dist_orthogonalProjection_sq_add_dist_orthogonalProjection_sq p₃ hp₁,
    dist_sq_eq_dist_orthogonalProjection_sq_add_dist_orthogonalProjection_sq p₃ hp₂]
  simp

/-- `p` is equidistant from a set of points in `s` if and only if its
`orthogonalProjection` is. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Projection/Variant0c9c9571b66a64edad7ec23f9e32b81421da3b3eecfca56dde9384bfa782ed79.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Projection/Variant0c9c9571b66a64edad7ec23f9e32b81421da3b3eecfca56dde9384bfa782ed79.lean#L379).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `677631e1550b57ba430dc68795e4c22ee2c5d3da` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
