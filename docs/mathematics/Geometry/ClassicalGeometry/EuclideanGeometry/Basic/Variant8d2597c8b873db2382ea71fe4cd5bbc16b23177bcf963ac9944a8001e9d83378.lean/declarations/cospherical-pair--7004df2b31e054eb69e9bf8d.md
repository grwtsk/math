## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2f79b713-ea31-1158-0ac1-9d63733a191b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 236–243.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cospherical_pair (p₁ p₂ : P) : Cospherical ({p₁, p₂} : Set P) :=
  ⟨midpoint ℝ p₁ p₂, ‖(2 : ℝ)‖⁻¹ * dist p₁ p₂, by
    rintro p (rfl | rfl | _)
    · rw [dist_comm, dist_midpoint_left (𝕜 := ℝ)]
    · rw [dist_comm, dist_midpoint_right (𝕜 := ℝ)]⟩

/-- A set of points is concyclic if it is cospherical and coplanar. (Most results are stated
directly in terms of `Cospherical` instead of using `Concyclic`.) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Basic/Variant8d2597c8b873db2382ea71fe4cd5bbc16b23177bcf963ac9944a8001e9d83378.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Basic/Variant8d2597c8b873db2382ea71fe4cd5bbc16b23177bcf963ac9944a8001e9d83378.lean#L236).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c2b3b099402443851352843d8c69e5e283214b89` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
