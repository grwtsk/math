## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2151828a-1a98-8d7d-0f8c-3cfb5aca5c72`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 590–598.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sbtw_of_collinear_of_dist_center_lt_radius {s : Sphere P} {p₁ p₂ p₃ : P}
    (h : Collinear ℝ ({p₁, p₂, p₃} : Set P)) (hp₁ : p₁ ∈ s) (hp₂ : dist p₂ s.center < s.radius)
    (hp₃ : p₃ ∈ s) (hp₁p₃ : p₁ ≠ p₃) : Sbtw ℝ p₁ p₂ p₃ :=
  h.sbtw_of_dist_eq_of_dist_lt hp₁ hp₂ hp₃ hp₁p₃

namespace Sphere

variable {s : Sphere P} {p₁ p₂ : P}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Basic/Variant8d2597c8b873db2382ea71fe4cd5bbc16b23177bcf963ac9944a8001e9d83378.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Basic/Variant8d2597c8b873db2382ea71fe4cd5bbc16b23177bcf963ac9944a8001e9d83378.lean#L590).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c2b3b099402443851352843d8c69e5e283214b89` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
