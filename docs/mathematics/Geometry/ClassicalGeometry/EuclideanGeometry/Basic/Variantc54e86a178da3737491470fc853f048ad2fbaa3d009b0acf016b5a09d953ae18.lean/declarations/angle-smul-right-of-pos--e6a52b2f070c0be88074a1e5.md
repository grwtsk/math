## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4049bf3c-601d-0c67-b85a-4ac2ec982f9d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem angle_smul_right_of_pos (x y : V) {r : ℝ} (hr : 0 < r) : angle x (r • y) = angle x y := by
  unfold angle
  rw [inner_smul_right, norm_smul, Real.norm_eq_abs, abs_of_nonneg (le_of_lt hr), ← mul_assoc,
    mul_comm _ r, mul_assoc, mul_div_mul_left _ _ (ne_of_gt hr)]

/-- The angle between a positive multiple of a vector and a vector. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Basic/Variantc54e86a178da3737491470fc853f048ad2fbaa3d009b0acf016b5a09d953ae18.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Basic/Variantc54e86a178da3737491470fc853f048ad2fbaa3d009b0acf016b5a09d953ae18.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4833c76af38ca76af825d03dfb545508ef47b607` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
