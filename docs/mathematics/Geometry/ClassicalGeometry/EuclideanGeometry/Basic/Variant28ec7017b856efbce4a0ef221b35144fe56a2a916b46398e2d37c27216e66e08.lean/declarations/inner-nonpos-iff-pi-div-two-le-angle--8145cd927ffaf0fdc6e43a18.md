## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:df810cbc-d6ae-db5b-f534-301cbf6220e5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 224–233.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem inner_nonpos_iff_pi_div_two_le_angle {x y : V} :
    ⟪x, y⟫ ≤ 0 ↔ π / 2 ≤ angle x y := by
  rw [angle, Real.pi_div_two_le_arccos]
  refine ⟨fun h => div_nonpos_of_nonpos_of_nonneg h (by positivity), fun h => ?_⟩
  by_contra hpos
  push Not at hpos
  exact absurd h (not_le.2 (div_pos hpos (hpos.trans_le (real_inner_le_norm x y))))

/-- The inner product of two vectors is negative if and only if the angle between them exceeds
`π / 2`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Basic/Variant28ec7017b856efbce4a0ef221b35144fe56a2a916b46398e2d37c27216e66e08.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Basic/Variant28ec7017b856efbce4a0ef221b35144fe56a2a916b46398e2d37c27216e66e08.lean#L224).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2cf8e67ba43a28fdc2440446b30026480e0a1087` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
