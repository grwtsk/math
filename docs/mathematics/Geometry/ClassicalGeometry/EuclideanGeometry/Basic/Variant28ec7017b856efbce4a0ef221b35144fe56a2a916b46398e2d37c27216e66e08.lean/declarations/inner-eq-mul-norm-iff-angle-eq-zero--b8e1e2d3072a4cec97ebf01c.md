## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:614a54a1-0a78-9663-4e87-39079b053a85`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 265–272.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem inner_eq_mul_norm_iff_angle_eq_zero {x y : V} (hx : x ≠ 0) (hy : y ≠ 0) :
    ⟪x, y⟫ = ‖x‖ * ‖y‖ ↔ angle x y = 0 := by
  refine ⟨fun h => ?_, inner_eq_mul_norm_of_angle_eq_zero⟩
  have h₁ : ‖x‖ * ‖y‖ ≠ 0 := (mul_pos (norm_pos_iff.mpr hx) (norm_pos_iff.mpr hy)).ne'
  rw [angle, h, div_self h₁, Real.arccos_one]

/-- If the angle between two vectors is π, the norm of their difference equals
the sum of their norms. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Basic/Variant28ec7017b856efbce4a0ef221b35144fe56a2a916b46398e2d37c27216e66e08.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Basic/Variant28ec7017b856efbce4a0ef221b35144fe56a2a916b46398e2d37c27216e66e08.lean#L265).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2cf8e67ba43a28fdc2440446b30026480e0a1087` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
