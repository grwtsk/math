## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:63963349-cfd2-710f-4358-47fd8ea4b818`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 998–1003.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem abs_oangle_sub_right_toReal_lt_pi_div_two {x y : V} (h : ‖x‖ = ‖y‖) :
    |(o.oangle x (x - y)).toReal| < π / 2 :=
  (o.oangle_sub_eq_oangle_sub_rev_of_norm_eq h).symm ▸ o.abs_oangle_sub_left_toReal_lt_pi_div_two h

/-- `y` has equal unoriented angles to `x` and `z` if and only if it has equal oriented angles
(bisects the angle) or `x` and `z` are on the same ray. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Basic/Variante4350b076c29d91bf2cf65c8fa38714ab7392a2838b6be7aa816cb3b4b3a21f0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Basic/Variante4350b076c29d91bf2cf65c8fa38714ab7392a2838b6be7aa816cb3b4b3a21f0.lean#L998).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `90e9bd1c4a1c866672c2bd7f790e5b1bb9fad448` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
