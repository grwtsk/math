## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:899f6058-792b-21af-feed-595f40a6eb02`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 589–595.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem concyclic_of_two_zsmul_oangle_eq_of_not_collinear {p₁ p₂ p₃ p₄ : P}
    (h : (2 : ℤ) • ∡ p₁ p₂ p₄ = (2 : ℤ) • ∡ p₁ p₃ p₄) (hn : ¬Collinear ℝ ({p₁, p₂, p₄} : Set P)) :
    Concyclic ({p₁, p₂, p₃, p₄} : Set P) :=
  ⟨cospherical_of_two_zsmul_oangle_eq_of_not_collinear h hn, coplanar_of_fact_finrank_eq_two _⟩

/-- Converse of "angles in same segment are equal" and "opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral
add to π", for oriented angles mod π, with a "cospherical or collinear" conclusion. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Sphere/Variantf074e2f88d68e3e03132d8803aa0f5136a4bafbee65f054d99d142b39eb0a31f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Sphere/Variantf074e2f88d68e3e03132d8803aa0f5136a4bafbee65f054d99d142b39eb0a31f.lean#L589).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `52a26f7cc9e8e4f28a50419588fbdcc6bca91460` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
