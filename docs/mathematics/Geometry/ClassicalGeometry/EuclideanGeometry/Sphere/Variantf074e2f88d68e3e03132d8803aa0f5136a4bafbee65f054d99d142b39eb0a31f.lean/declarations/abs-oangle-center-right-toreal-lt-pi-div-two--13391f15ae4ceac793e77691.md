## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1025fb25-0c0a-ec84-12be-44c309f355b1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 340–348.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem abs_oangle_center_right_toReal_lt_pi_div_two {s : Sphere P} {p₁ p₂ : P} (hp₁ : p₁ ∈ s)
    (hp₂ : p₂ ∈ s) : |(∡ p₂ p₁ s.center).toReal| < π / 2 :=
  abs_oangle_left_toReal_lt_pi_div_two_of_dist_eq
    (dist_center_eq_dist_center_of_mem_sphere' hp₂ hp₁)

/-- Given two points on a circle, the center of that circle may be expressed explicitly as a
multiple (by half the tangent of the angle between the chord and the radius at one of those
points) of a `π / 2` rotation of the vector between those points, plus the midpoint of those
points. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Sphere/Variantf074e2f88d68e3e03132d8803aa0f5136a4bafbee65f054d99d142b39eb0a31f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Sphere/Variantf074e2f88d68e3e03132d8803aa0f5136a4bafbee65f054d99d142b39eb0a31f.lean#L340).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `52a26f7cc9e8e4f28a50419588fbdcc6bca91460` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
