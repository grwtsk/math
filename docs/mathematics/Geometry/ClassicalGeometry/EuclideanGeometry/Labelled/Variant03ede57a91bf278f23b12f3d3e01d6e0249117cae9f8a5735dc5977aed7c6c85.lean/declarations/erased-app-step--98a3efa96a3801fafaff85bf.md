## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:34516cac-f9b5-0f88-a76b-5501a3e8e0df`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1137–1151.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem erased_app_step {S : Type u} {f a N : PureTypeSystem.Expr S}
    (h : PureTypeSystem.Beta (.app f a) N) :
    (∃ D b, f = .lam D b ∧ N = b.instantiate a) ∨
    (∃ f', PureTypeSystem.Beta f f' ∧ N = .app f' a) ∨
    (∃ a', PureTypeSystem.Beta a a' ∧ N = .app f a') := by
  cases h with
  | head D b a => exact .inl ⟨D, b, rfl, rfl⟩
  | app_left h => exact .inr (.inl ⟨_, h, rfl⟩)
  | app_right h => exact .inr (.inr ⟨_, h, rfl⟩)

namespace HasType
variable {S : Type u} {P : Specification S} {Γ : List (Expr S)} {M T : Expr S}

/-- Every erased redex of a typable labelled term has matching labels, even
inside its annotations. No weak or strong normalization is assumed. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Labelled/Variant03ede57a91bf278f23b12f3d3e01d6e0249117cae9f8a5735dc5977aed7c6c85.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Labelled/Variant03ede57a91bf278f23b12f3d3e01d6e0249117cae9f8a5735dc5977aed7c6c85.lean#L1137).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f89b53b22fb5c4bd4e3ea1cad0cfa6744a4dc606` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
