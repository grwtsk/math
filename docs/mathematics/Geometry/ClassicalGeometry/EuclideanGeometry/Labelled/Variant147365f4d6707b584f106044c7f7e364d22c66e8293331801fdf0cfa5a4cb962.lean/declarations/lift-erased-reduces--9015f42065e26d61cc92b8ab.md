## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:608157cd-236c-7e39-68f0-6ee462b90ea3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1170–1180.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lift_erased_reduces (h : HasType P Γ M T) {N : PureTypeSystem.Expr S}
    (hr : PureTypeSystem.Reduces M.erase N) :
    ∃ M', Reduces M M' ∧ M'.erase = N ∧ HasType P Γ M' T := by
  induction hr with
  | refl => exact ⟨M, .refl, rfl, h⟩
  | tail hred hstep ih =>
      obtain ⟨M', hMM', he, ht⟩ := ih
      obtain ⟨M'', hM'M'', he'⟩ := ht.lift_erased_step (he ▸ hstep)
      exact ⟨M'', hMM'.tail hM'M'', he', ht.subject_reduction hM'M''⟩

/-- The exact final interface of the labelled-metatheory lemma. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Labelled/Variant147365f4d6707b584f106044c7f7e364d22c66e8293331801fdf0cfa5a4cb962.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Labelled/Variant147365f4d6707b584f106044c7f7e364d22c66e8293331801fdf0cfa5a4cb962.lean#L1170).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a4d5350e279d8e5af39f91c1b91e180fe4c81c74` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
