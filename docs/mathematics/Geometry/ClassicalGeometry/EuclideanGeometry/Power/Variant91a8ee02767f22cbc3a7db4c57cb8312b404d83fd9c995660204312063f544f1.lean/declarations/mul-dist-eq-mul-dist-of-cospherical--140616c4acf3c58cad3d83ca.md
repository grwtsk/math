## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:038da230-7ccb-a654-a6a5-6cbd5126a1a4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mul_dist_eq_mul_dist_of_cospherical {a b c d p : P} (h : Cospherical ({a, b, c, d} : Set P))
    (hapb : p ∈ line[ℝ, a, b]) (hcpd : p ∈ line[ℝ, c, d]) :
    dist a p * dist b p = dist c p * dist d p := by
  obtain ⟨q, r, h'⟩ := (cospherical_def {a, b, c, d}).mp h
  obtain ⟨ha, hb, hc, hd⟩ := h' a (by simp), h' b (by simp), h' c (by simp), h' d (by simp)
  rw [← hd] at hc
  rw [← hb] at ha
  rw [mul_dist_eq_abs_sub_sq_dist hapb ha, hb, mul_dist_eq_abs_sub_sq_dist hcpd hc, hd]

/-- **Intersecting Chords Theorem**. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Power/Variant91a8ee02767f22cbc3a7db4c57cb8312b404d83fd9c995660204312063f544f1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Power/Variant91a8ee02767f22cbc3a7db4c57cb8312b404d83fd9c995660204312063f544f1.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7c1075bf15e3e0bfe98d8cd97bd080ba9ca8b7df` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
