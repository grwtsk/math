## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e9c2bc75-9987-7900-9e9a-8c07d9bccc72`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 309–320.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dist_sq_eq_mul_dist_of_tangent_and_secant {a b t p : P} {s : Sphere P}
    (ha : a ∈ s) (hb : b ∈ s)
    (hp : p ∈ line[ℝ, a, b])
    (h_tangent : s.IsTangentAt t (line[ℝ, p, t])) :
    dist p t ^ 2 = dist p a * dist p b := by
  have hr := radius_nonneg_of_mem ha
  have radius_le_dist := h_tangent.isTangent.radius_le_dist_center (left_mem_affineSpan_pair ℝ p t)
  rw [mul_dist_eq_power_of_radius_le_dist_center hr hp ha hb radius_le_dist,
    Sphere.power, h_tangent.dist_sq_eq_of_mem (left_mem_affineSpan_pair ℝ p t)]
  ring

/-- The power of a point with respect to a sphere equals the square of its tangent length. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Power/Variant91a8ee02767f22cbc3a7db4c57cb8312b404d83fd9c995660204312063f544f1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Power/Variant91a8ee02767f22cbc3a7db4c57cb8312b404d83fd9c995660204312063f544f1.lean#L309).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7c1075bf15e3e0bfe98d8cd97bd080ba9ca8b7df` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
