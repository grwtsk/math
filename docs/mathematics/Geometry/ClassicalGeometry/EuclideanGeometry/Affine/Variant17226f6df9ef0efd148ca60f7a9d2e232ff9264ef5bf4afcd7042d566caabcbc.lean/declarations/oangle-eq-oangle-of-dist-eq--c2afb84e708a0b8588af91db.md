## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0f9bbacb-f1ae-eeda-35ba-cdeb9f5ffabd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 277–284.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem oangle_eq_oangle_of_dist_eq {p₁ p₂ p₃ : P} (h : dist p₁ p₂ = dist p₁ p₃) :
    ∡ p₁ p₂ p₃ = ∡ p₂ p₃ p₁ := by
  simp_rw [dist_eq_norm_vsub V] at h
  rw [oangle, oangle, ← vsub_sub_vsub_cancel_left p₃ p₂ p₁, ← vsub_sub_vsub_cancel_left p₂ p₃ p₁,
    o.oangle_sub_eq_oangle_sub_rev_of_norm_eq h]

/-- The angle at the apex of an isosceles triangle is `π` minus twice a base angle, oriented
angle-at-point form. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Affine/Variant17226f6df9ef0efd148ca60f7a9d2e232ff9264ef5bf4afcd7042d566caabcbc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/Affine/Variant17226f6df9ef0efd148ca60f7a9d2e232ff9264ef5bf4afcd7042d566caabcbc.lean#L277).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `865abc9f8f6a0a7473995d10d0a560913e9f4621` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
