## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:76a4990d4da32af4777721bc5477e45bd03b937e9cec8f041ecc7e1f5b0621ca`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 123–142.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def CarrierIndexedState.carrierEquivExactCarrier
    {size carrierCount : Nat}
    (state : CarrierIndexedState size carrierCount) :
    Fin carrierCount ≃
      { cell : GridCell size size // ExactCarrier size state.sourcePoint cell } where
  toFun index := ⟨state.carrier index, state.carrierSound index⟩
  invFun cell := Classical.choose (state.carrierComplete cell.1 cell.2)
  left_inv index := by
    apply state.carrierInjective
    exact Classical.choose_spec
      (state.carrierComplete
        (state.carrier index) (state.carrierSound index))
  right_inv cell := by
    apply Subtype.ext
    exact Classical.choose_spec (state.carrierComplete cell.1 cell.2)


/-- A certified state has exactly the geometric carrier multiplicity of its
source point.  In particular, duplicate array entries cannot inflate the
runtime carrier count. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/CheckedFiniteCarrierCoordinates/Varianta330bd9a635a18f2/CertifiedCarrierEnumeration.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/ClassicalGeometry/EuclideanGeometry/CheckedFiniteCarrierCoordinates/Varianta330bd9a635a18f2/CertifiedCarrierEnumeration.lean#L123).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2cfb92dd47021aeeb2907ec25c66ce9540fd2156` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
