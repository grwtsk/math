## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e5168949-a966-50a1-36de-0b4176e9dae8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 225–232.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma eventually_eq_sum_coeff_smul [Fintype ι]
    (hs : IsLocalFrameOn I F n s u) (t : Π x : M, V x) (hu'' : u ∈ 𝓝 x) :
    ∀ᶠ x' in 𝓝 x, t x' = ∑ i, hs.coeff i x' (t x') • (s i x') :=
  eventually_of_mem hu'' fun _ hx ↦ hs.coeff_sum_eq _ hx

variable {t t' : Π x : M, V x}

/-- The coefficients of `t` in a local frame at `x` only depend on `t` at `x`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Geometry/LocalFrame/Variantcf689053f7d32f5d52813ac2ddcbd7af23d4df99609e2e8d6ccbfccd0211eb0f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/LocalFrame/Variantcf689053f7d32f5d52813ac2ddcbd7af23d4df99609e2e8d6ccbfccd0211eb0f.lean#L225).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `249a23c9c37f4b144266620bcd7ea9f8eb27b350` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
