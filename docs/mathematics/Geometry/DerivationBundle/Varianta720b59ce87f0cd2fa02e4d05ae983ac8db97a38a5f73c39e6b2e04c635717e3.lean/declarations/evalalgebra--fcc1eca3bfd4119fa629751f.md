## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:09ee6fa607d9e8f1965a6d683c7c63d39ec7abcea9f8ef6aa0111aeaafc83683`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 81–84.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance evalAlgebra {x : M} : Algebra C^∞⟮I, M; 𝕜⟯⟨x⟩ 𝕜 :=
  (ContMDiffMap.evalRingHom x : C^∞⟮I, M; 𝕜⟯⟨x⟩ →+* 𝕜).toAlgebra

/-- With the `evalAlgebra` algebra structure evaluation is actually an algebra morphism. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Geometry/DerivationBundle/Varianta720b59ce87f0cd2fa02e4d05ae983ac8db97a38a5f73c39e6b2e04c635717e3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Geometry/DerivationBundle/Varianta720b59ce87f0cd2fa02e4d05ae983ac8db97a38a5f73c39e6b2e04c635717e3.lean#L81).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6f9cd3ac0af40c9d788231ab3a486a658df88299` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
