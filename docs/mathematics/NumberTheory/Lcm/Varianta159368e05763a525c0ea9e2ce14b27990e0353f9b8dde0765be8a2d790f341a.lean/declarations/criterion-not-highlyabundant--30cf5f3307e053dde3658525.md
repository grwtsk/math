## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fc1063cc-9557-ca5f-d6f6-c7a5db9f3abf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 981–991.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Criterion.not_highlyAbundant (c : Criterion) : ¬HighlyAbundant (L c.n) :=
  c.not_highlyAbundant_2 c.σnorm_M_ge_σnorm_L'_mul

blueprint_comment /--
\begin{remark}
Analogous arguments allow other pairs \((c,\alpha)\) in place of \((4,3/8)\),
such as \((2,1/4)\), \((6,17/36)\), \((30,0.632\dots)\); or even \((1,0)\) provided more primes are
used on the \(p\)-side than the \(q\)-side to restore an asymptotic advantage.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Lcm/Varianta159368e05763a525c0ea9e2ce14b27990e0353f9b8dde0765be8a2d790f341a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Lcm/Varianta159368e05763a525c0ea9e2ce14b27990e0353f9b8dde0765be8a2d790f341a.lean#L981).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5cb9afb3bbcc8b6114129c1b549a9f2ad5d98440` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
