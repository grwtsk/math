## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:95b0010b-74b2-19bf-b665-7fe33be3c032`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 141–154.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

        c.hp_mono (show 1 < 2 by decide), c.hq_mono (show 0 < 1 by decide),
        c.hq_mono (show 1 < 2 by decide)]
    · grind [c.hp_mono (show 0 < 1 by decide) , c.hp_mono (show 1 < 2 by decide)]
    · grind [h_pi_gt_two 0, h_pi_gt_two 1, h_pi_gt_two 2, c.hp_mono (show 0 < 1 by decide),
        c.hp_mono (show 1 < 2 by decide)]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Lcm/Variant7acb76f732336a920c4fcd5b2088ac2be18b31c231e5c2bd66157dc60bf86358.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Lcm/Variant7acb76f732336a920c4fcd5b2088ac2be18b31c231e5c2bd66157dc60bf86358.lean#L141).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a71400b521d5902842b91edafd8e491fe67e89eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
