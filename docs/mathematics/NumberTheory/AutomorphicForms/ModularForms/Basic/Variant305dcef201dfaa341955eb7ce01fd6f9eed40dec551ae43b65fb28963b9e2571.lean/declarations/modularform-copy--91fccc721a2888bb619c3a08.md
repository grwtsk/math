## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1048820a7022c8b9fe67165a581e891c234e21874483dda45542d53c531bc7a0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 183–191.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def ModularForm.copy {Γ' : Subgroup (GL (Fin 2) ℝ)} (f : ModularForm Γ k) (f' : ℍ → ℂ)
    (h : f' = ⇑f) (hΓ : Γ' = Γ := by rfl) : ModularForm Γ' k where
  toFun := f'
  slash_action_eq' A hA := h.symm ▸ f.slash_action_eq' A (hΓ ▸ hA)
  holo' := h.symm ▸ f.holo'
  bdd_at_cusps' hc := h.symm ▸ f.bdd_at_cusps' (hΓ ▸ hc)

/-- Copy of a `CuspForm` with a new `toFun` equal to the old one, optionally transporting
along an equality of subgroups. Useful to fix definitional equalities. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AutomorphicForms/ModularForms/Basic/Variant305dcef201dfaa341955eb7ce01fd6f9eed40dec551ae43b65fb28963b9e2571.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AutomorphicForms/ModularForms/Basic/Variant305dcef201dfaa341955eb7ce01fd6f9eed40dec551ae43b65fb28963b9e2571.lean#L183).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `307693d94d4781c722f741cfe13d33af53f8ebf1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
