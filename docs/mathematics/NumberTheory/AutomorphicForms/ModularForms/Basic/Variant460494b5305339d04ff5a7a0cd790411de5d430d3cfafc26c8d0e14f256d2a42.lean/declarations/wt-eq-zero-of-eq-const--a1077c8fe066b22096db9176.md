## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e4a42f75-fe0c-a0f7-f2af-06299571a563`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 56–65.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma wt_eq_zero_of_eq_const {f : F} {c : ℂ} (hf : ⇑f = Function.const _ c) :
    k = 0 ∨ c = 0 := by
  have : SlashInvariantFormClass F Γ(1) k := Gamma_one_coe_eq_SL ▸ ‹_›
  have hI := slash_action_eqn_SL'' f (mem_Gamma_one S) I
  have h2I2 := slash_action_eqn_SL'' f (mem_Gamma_one S) ((⟨2, two_pos⟩ : {x : ℝ // 0 < x}) • .I)
  simp_rw [sl_moeb, hf, Function.const, denom_S] at hI h2I2
  suffices (2 : ℂ) ^ k = 1 ↔ k = 0 by
    simpa [mul_zpow, zpow_ne_zero, this] using h2I2.symm.trans hI
  simpa using ofReal_inj.trans <| zpow_eq_one_iff_right₀ (two_pos.le : (0 : ℝ) ≤ 2) (by norm_num1)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AutomorphicForms/ModularForms/Basic/Variant460494b5305339d04ff5a7a0cd790411de5d430d3cfafc26c8d0e14f256d2a42.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AutomorphicForms/ModularForms/Basic/Variant460494b5305339d04ff5a7a0cd790411de5d430d3cfafc26c8d0e14f256d2a42.lean#L56).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `abafa2680456df6ea78dc9a5ffeb88b3f78281a2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
