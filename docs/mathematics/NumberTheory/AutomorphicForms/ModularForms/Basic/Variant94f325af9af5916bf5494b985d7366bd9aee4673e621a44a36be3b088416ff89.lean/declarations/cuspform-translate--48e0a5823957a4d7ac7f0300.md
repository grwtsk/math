## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4fd5a0dbb9cd627275e904926c0cc3b27a7cfb7568ec871850b7e8a004e061e3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 676–686.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def CuspForm.translate [CuspFormClass F Γ k] (g : GL (Fin 2) ℝ) :
    CuspForm (toConjAct g⁻¹ • Γ) k where
  __ := ModularForm.translate f g
  zero_at_cusps' {c} hc γ hγ := by
    rw [SlashInvariantForm.toFun_eq_coe, ModularForm.toSlashInvariantForm_coe,
      ModularForm.coe_translate, ← SlashAction.slash_mul, ← isZeroAt_infty_iff,
      ← OnePoint.IsZeroAt.smul_iff]
    apply CuspFormClass.zero_at_cusps f
    simpa [mul_smul, hγ] using hc.smul g

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AutomorphicForms/ModularForms/Basic/Variant94f325af9af5916bf5494b985d7366bd9aee4673e621a44a36be3b088416ff89.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AutomorphicForms/ModularForms/Basic/Variant94f325af9af5916bf5494b985d7366bd9aee4673e621a44a36be3b088416ff89.lean#L676).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `281ac863f6762ca846eae0ab571d078a9bec9914` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
