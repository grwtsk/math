## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b577d9a2632cc67b2b819c4d746104372bb0491139f298405e7c329009efd295`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 49–57.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ModularForm extends SlashInvariantForm Γ k where
  holo' : MDifferentiable 𝓘(ℂ) 𝓘(ℂ) (toSlashInvariantForm : ℍ → ℂ)
  bdd_at_infty' : ∀ A : SL(2, ℤ), IsBoundedAtImInfty (toSlashInvariantForm ∣[k] A)
#align modular_form ModularForm

/-- The `slash_invariant_form` associated to a `modular_form`. -/
add_decl_doc ModularForm.toSlashInvariantForm

/-- These are `slash_invariant_form`s that are holomophic and zero at infinity. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AutomorphicForms/ModularForms/Basic/Variant9ac55f3bc22867e03df7bd13b01d30009294939725f5d4d5e10cd4249da213da.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AutomorphicForms/ModularForms/Basic/Variant9ac55f3bc22867e03df7bd13b01d30009294939725f5d4d5e10cd4249da213da.lean#L49).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `abf70e98aafbf0871a208dbd80e296934efc75a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
