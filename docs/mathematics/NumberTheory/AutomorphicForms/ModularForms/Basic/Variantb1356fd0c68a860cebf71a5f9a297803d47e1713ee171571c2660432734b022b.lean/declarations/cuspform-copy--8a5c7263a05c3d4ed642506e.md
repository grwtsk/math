## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:44267e893907d1a194f3b7cd8a0d7330bea3ba6f7d7295bbe28eb73d6ed65bf0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 131–144.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def CuspForm.copy (f : CuspForm Γ k) (f' : ℍ → ℂ) (h : f' = ⇑f) : CuspForm Γ k where
  toSlashInvariantForm := f.1.copy f' h
  holo' := h.symm ▸ f.holo'
  zero_at_infty' A := h.symm ▸ f.zero_at_infty' A
#align cusp_form.copy CuspForm.copy

end ModularForm

namespace ModularForm

open SlashInvariantForm

variable {F : Type*} {Γ : Subgroup SL(2, ℤ)} {k : ℤ}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AutomorphicForms/ModularForms/Basic/Variantb1356fd0c68a860cebf71a5f9a297803d47e1713ee171571c2660432734b022b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AutomorphicForms/ModularForms/Basic/Variantb1356fd0c68a860cebf71a5f9a297803d47e1713ee171571c2660432734b022b.lean#L131).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `61a34610df4bf223623f55910e09cfa399689550` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
