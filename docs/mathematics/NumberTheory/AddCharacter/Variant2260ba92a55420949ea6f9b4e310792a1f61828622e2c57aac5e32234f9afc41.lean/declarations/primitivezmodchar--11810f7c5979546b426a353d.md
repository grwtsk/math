## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:26cdb73d7d525155ffe66171354af4024765db6d0279be5ff8e85fdad0aee273`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 387–402.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def primitiveZModChar (n : ℕ+) (F' : Type v) [Field F'] (h : (n : F') ≠ 0) :
    PrimitiveAddChar (ZMod n) F' :=
  haveI : NeZero ((n : ℕ) : F') := ⟨h⟩
  ⟨n, zmodChar n (IsCyclotomicExtension.zeta_pow n F' _),
    zmodChar_primitive_of_primitive_root n (IsCyclotomicExtension.zeta_spec n F' _)⟩

### Existence of a primitive additive character on a finite field
-/


/-- There is a primitive additive character on the finite field `F` if the characteristic
of the target is different from that of `F`.
We obtain it as the composition of the trace from `F` to `ZMod p` with a primitive
additive character on `ZMod p`, where `p` is the characteristic of `F`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AddCharacter/Variant2260ba92a55420949ea6f9b4e310792a1f61828622e2c57aac5e32234f9afc41.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AddCharacter/Variant2260ba92a55420949ea6f9b4e310792a1f61828622e2c57aac5e32234f9afc41.lean#L387).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b70aea8e3745ab061bd55311edd9ff3ef3bd909a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
