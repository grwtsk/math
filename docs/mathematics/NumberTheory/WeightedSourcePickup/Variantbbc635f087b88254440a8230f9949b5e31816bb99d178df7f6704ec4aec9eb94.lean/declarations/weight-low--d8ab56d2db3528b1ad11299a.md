## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ba370382-4b02-8bf0-ca15-d2f416f541a5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–66.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem weight_low {A t : ℝ} {n : ℕ} (hA : 1 ≤ A)
    (ht : 2 * Real.log A ≤ t) (hn : (n : ℝ) ≤ A ^ 2) :
    pickupWeight A t n = 2 * (A⁻¹ - Real.exp (-t / 2)) := by
  simp only [pickupWeight, atomPickup, if_pos hn,
    if_pos (hn.trans (cutoff_order hA ht))]
  ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/WeightedSourcePickup/Variantbbc635f087b88254440a8230f9949b5e31816bb99d178df7f6704ec4aec9eb94.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/WeightedSourcePickup/Variantbbc635f087b88254440a8230f9949b5e31816bb99d178df7f6704ec4aec9eb94.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e090029032b0ce8c05231f93d1229884f89758b2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
