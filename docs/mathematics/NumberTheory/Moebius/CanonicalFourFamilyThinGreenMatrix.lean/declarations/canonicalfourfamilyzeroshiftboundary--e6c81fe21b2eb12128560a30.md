## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9c58d7ca87b171483e482d1289e220074e29a16d2aa73437b70cff7cdbdfec76`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 309–315.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def canonicalFourFamilyZeroShiftBoundary (n : ℕ) : ℝ :=
  Real.log (n : ℝ) -
    (if 2 ∣ n then Real.log ((n / 2 : ℕ) : ℝ) else 0)

/-- The signed matrix and TWO exact correction channels (other shifts,
zero shift) recover the literal von Mangoldt input at every source window
point. This is ONE exact coefficient-level supplier. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Moebius/CanonicalFourFamilyThinGreenMatrix.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Moebius/CanonicalFourFamilyThinGreenMatrix.lean#L309).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f71dbe475e99bce6b8ea8c633f320b118d69b6d5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
