## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6425680a-1d43-bd69-465a-ba2ffe8bb49d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 99–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem one_sub_twoKernelShiftCharacter_eq_oddSelector
    (d h : ℕ) [NeZero d]
    (hNonunit : TwoNonunitSquareModulusParameter d) :
    1 - twoKernelShiftCharacter d h =
      if Odd h then (2 : ℂ) else 0 := by
  rw [twoKernelShiftCharacter_eq_neg_one_pow d h hNonunit]
  rcases Nat.even_or_odd h with hEven | hOdd
  · have hNotOdd : ¬ Odd h :=
      Nat.not_odd_iff_even.mpr hEven
    rw [hEven.neg_one_pow]
    simp [hNotOdd]
  · rw [hOdd.neg_one_pow]
    simp [hOdd]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Moebius/RegularOrbitShiftParityProjectors.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Moebius/RegularOrbitShiftParityProjectors.lean#L99).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c704448768339770aa5b21459dfdc2b9fd291867` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
