## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a37daf20-0c86-1e10-f809-ceea1107b517`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 63–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem damped_wholePickup_eq_exponentialVolterra (σ t : ℝ) :
    Real.exp (-σ * t) * wholePickup t =
      exponentialVolterra σ (dampedMertensSource σ) t := by
  rw [exponentialVolterra_eq_damped_primitive]
  congr 1
  unfold wholePickup
  apply intervalIntegral.integral_congr
  intro u _hu
  unfold dampedMertensSource
  have he : Real.exp (σ * u) * Real.exp (-σ * u) = 1 := by
    rw [← Real.exp_add]
    convert Real.exp_zero using 1
    ring
  change pickupVelocity u =
    Real.exp (σ * u) * (Real.exp (-σ * u) * pickupVelocity u)
  rw [← mul_assoc, he, one_mul]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Moebius/LogarithmicMertensBoundary.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Moebius/LogarithmicMertensBoundary.lean#L63).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4b4a5f2f8bb5f822f55f3d75083c8da8ac214c22` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
