## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5ac50db3-c400-7eab-d8fd-9c471fd67318`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 198–211.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem complex_cast_mertensEndpointCrossCongruenceFibre_eq_additiveFourier
    (b d : ℕ) [NeZero d] :
    (mertensEndpointCrossCongruenceFibre b d : ℂ) =
      additiveFourierEndpointCrossCongruenceFibre b d := by
  rw [← complexMertensEndpointCrossCongruenceFibre_eq_cast]
  exact
    (complexMertensEndpointCrossCongruenceFibre_eq_additiveSelector b d).trans
      (additiveSelectorEndpointCrossFibre_eq_fourier b d)

/-- Proof-relevant repair object replacing the open placeholder from PR #594.

Its only field is the substantive all-endpoint/all-positive-modulus Fourier
identity.  Coverage of nonunits and preservation of the square modulus are
properties of that exact formula, not separate Boolean-style flags. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Moebius/AdditiveCharacterSquareModulusRepair.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Moebius/AdditiveCharacterSquareModulusRepair.lean#L198).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1d43c5324923c0019b728634a661ba6b84dc187e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
