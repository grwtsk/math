## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f55ee785-fa2b-e4e2-9e84-0d831ccf5e4a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 205–222.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem wholePickup_fixed_inventory {u T : ℝ} (hu : 0 ≤ u) (huT : u ≤ T) :
    wholePickup u = ∑ n ∈ Finset.Icc 1 ⌊Real.exp T⌋₊,
      moebiusReal n * pickupResponse n u := by
  rw [wholePickup_response_sum hu]
  apply Finset.sum_subset
  · intro n hn
    have hne := Finset.mem_Icc.mp hn
    exact Finset.mem_Icc.mpr ⟨hne.1,
      hne.2.trans (Nat.floor_mono (Real.exp_le_exp.mpr huT))⟩
  · intro n hnT hnu
    have hn1 := (Finset.mem_Icc.mp hnT).1
    have hnot : ¬Real.log n ≤ u := by
      intro h
      exact hnu (Finset.mem_Icc.mpr
        ⟨hn1, (pickup_log_le_iff_closed_cutoff hn1 u).mp h⟩)
    simp [pickupResponse, hnot]

/-- The two actual response branches agree at the closed event. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Moebius/FiniteResponseSum.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Moebius/FiniteResponseSum.lean#L205).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5e6c4b01e48f5cf6e779023aac9098fc0801127d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
