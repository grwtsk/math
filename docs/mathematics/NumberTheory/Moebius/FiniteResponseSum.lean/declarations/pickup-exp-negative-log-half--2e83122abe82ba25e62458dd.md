## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dd384059-f588-ec93-40f5-277405de8753`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 121–132.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pickup_exp_negative_log_half {n : ℕ} (hn : 1 ≤ n) :
    Real.exp (-Real.log n / 2) = (Real.sqrt n)⁻¹ := by
  have hnpos : (0 : ℝ) < n := by exact_mod_cast hn
  have hs : Real.sqrt (Real.exp (Real.log n)) = Real.exp (Real.log n / 2) := by
    have he : Real.exp (Real.log n) = Real.exp (Real.log n / 2) ^ 2 := by
      rw [pow_two, ← Real.exp_add]
      congr 1
      ring
    rw [he, Real.sqrt_sq (Real.exp_pos _).le]
  rw [Real.exp_log hnpos] at hs
  rw [show -Real.log (n : ℝ) / 2 = -(Real.log n / 2) by ring, Real.exp_neg, ← hs]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Moebius/FiniteResponseSum.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Moebius/FiniteResponseSum.lean#L121).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5e6c4b01e48f5cf6e779023aac9098fc0801127d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
