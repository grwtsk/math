## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:291e9b95-10f1-2de3-24f6-6715db4e3aea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 45–60.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coreGrowingShiftEndpointExplicitPrefixSet_eq_differenceClipped
    (j n m : ℕ) :
    coreGrowingShiftEndpointExplicitPrefixSet j n m =
      Finset.Ico
        (max n
          (coreGrowingShiftEndpointDifferencePrefixLower j (m - n)))
        (coreGrowingShiftEndpointDifferencePrefixUpper j (m - n)) := by
  ext N
  simp [coreGrowingShiftEndpointExplicitPrefixSet,
    coreGrowingShiftEndpointAggregatePrefixLower,
    coreGrowingShiftEndpointAggregatePrefixUpper,
    coreGrowingShiftEndpointDifferencePrefixLower,
    coreGrowingShiftEndpointDifferencePrefixUpper,
    max_le_iff, lt_min_iff, and_assoc, and_left_comm, and_comm]

/-- Generic anchor block for an arbitrary prefix interval. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Moebius/CoreGrowingShiftSignedEndpointDifferenceFourier.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Moebius/CoreGrowingShiftSignedEndpointDifferenceFourier.lean#L45).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ba1c8768fe161ccfc1706dfac226e2945333dff8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
