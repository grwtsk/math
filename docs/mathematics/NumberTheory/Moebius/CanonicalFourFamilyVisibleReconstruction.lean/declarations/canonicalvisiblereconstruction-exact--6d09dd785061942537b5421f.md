## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eb68d3c1-6ec1-a01e-97aa-bb2daf08a2bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 106–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem canonicalVisibleReconstruction_exact {X : ℕ} (hX : 3 ≤ X) (a : ℝ) :
    canonicalVisibleReconstruction X hX
      (canonicalFourFamilyWindowReadout X (canonicalVisibleCellPacketThree a)) =
        canonicalVisibleCellPacketThree a := by
  unfold canonicalVisibleReconstruction canonicalFourFamilyWindowReadout
  rw [canonicalVisibleRow_apply hX]
  congr 1
  exact mul_div_cancel_left₀ a (ne_of_gt (canonicalVisible_log_pos hX))

/-- A concrete norm estimate for this constructed R on every actual readout.
The scale-dependent coefficient is bounded uniformly below by log 2. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Moebius/CanonicalFourFamilyVisibleReconstruction.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Moebius/CanonicalFourFamilyVisibleReconstruction.lean#L106).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `700259ff0436b89eede082e8eaea36105fc32f24` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
