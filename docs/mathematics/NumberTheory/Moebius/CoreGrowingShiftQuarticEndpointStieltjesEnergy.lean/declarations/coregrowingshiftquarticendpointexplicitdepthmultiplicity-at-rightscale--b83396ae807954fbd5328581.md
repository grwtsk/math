## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:baae4b93-1fc9-d649-60cb-05b7848693f2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 61–81.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coreGrowingShiftQuarticEndpointExplicitDepthMultiplicity_at_rightScale
    (j h : ℕ) :
    coreGrowingShiftQuarticEndpointExplicitDepthMultiplicity
      j h (2 ^ (j + 1)) = 0 := by
  apply
    coreGrowingShiftQuarticEndpointExplicitDepthMultiplicity_eq_zero_of_upper_le_lower
  have hU :
      coreGrowingShiftQuarticEndpointExplicitDepthUpper j h ≤
        2 ^ (j + 1) := by
    unfold coreGrowingShiftQuarticEndpointExplicitDepthUpper
    exact le_trans (min_le_left _ _) (Nat.sub_le _ _)
  have hL :
      2 ^ (j + 1) ≤
        coreGrowingShiftQuarticEndpointExplicitDepthLower
          j h (2 ^ (j + 1)) := by
    unfold coreGrowingShiftQuarticEndpointExplicitDepthLower
    exact le_trans (le_max_left _ _)
      (le_max_right _ _)
  exact le_trans hU hL

/-- Real endpoint weight also vanishes at the right dyadic endpoint. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Moebius/CoreGrowingShiftQuarticEndpointStieltjesEnergy.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Moebius/CoreGrowingShiftQuarticEndpointStieltjesEnergy.lean#L61).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b1bfa84eb99b3829a02980495e11decb5c0cf75b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
