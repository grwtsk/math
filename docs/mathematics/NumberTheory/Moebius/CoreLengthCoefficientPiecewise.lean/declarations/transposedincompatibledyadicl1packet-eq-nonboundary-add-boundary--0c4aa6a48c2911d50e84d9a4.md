## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b4064333-f319-edf4-fa53-a0f9dcbec571`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 170–184.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem transposedIncompatibleDyadicL1Packet_eq_nonboundary_add_boundary
    {j : ℕ}
    (hHX : logarithmicShiftThreshold j ≤ 2 ^ j) :
    transposedIncompatibleDyadicL1Packet j =
      2 * (
        (∑ n ∈ Finset.Ico (logarithmicShiftThreshold j) (2 ^ j),
          coreLengthCoefficientMass j n *
            incompatibleDyadicStartBlockL1 j n) +
        coreLengthCoefficientMass j (2 ^ j) *
          incompatibleDyadicStartBlockL1 j (2 ^ j)) := by
  rw [transposedIncompatibleDyadicL1Packet_eq_truncated]
  rw [Finset.sum_Ico_succ_top hHX]

/-- Source-facing weighted incompatible L1 obligation after all coefficient
mass geometry has been discharged. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Moebius/CoreLengthCoefficientPiecewise.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Moebius/CoreLengthCoefficientPiecewise.lean#L170).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7ec304e3791139f6bdfc9fe385ab886e5502f90b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
