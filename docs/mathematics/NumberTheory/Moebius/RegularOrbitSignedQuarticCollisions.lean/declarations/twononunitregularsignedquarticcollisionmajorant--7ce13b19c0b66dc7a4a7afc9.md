## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e8f8e939d565fa2f8dd1cdd997263cf938f836c17076faeca102f70618a62997`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 188–203.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def twoNonunitRegularSignedQuarticCollisionMajorant
    (b d : ℕ) [NeZero d] : ℝ :=
  Real.sqrt
      (parityHalfShiftSignedQuarticCollision
        b d 0 (positiveEndpointEvenShiftSet b)) +
    Real.sqrt
      (parityHalfShiftSignedQuarticCollision
        b d 0 (positiveEndpointOddShiftSet b)) +
    Real.sqrt
      (parityHalfShiftSignedQuarticCollision
        b d 1 (positiveEndpointEvenShiftSet b)) +
    Real.sqrt
      (parityHalfShiftSignedQuarticCollision
        b d 1 (positiveEndpointOddShiftSet b))

/-- Exact equality of the residue-L2 and signed quartic collision majorants. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Moebius/RegularOrbitSignedQuarticCollisions.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Moebius/RegularOrbitSignedQuarticCollisions.lean#L188).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ebc689c713c4dbf69e54c97b594ba519c2f5bd4f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
