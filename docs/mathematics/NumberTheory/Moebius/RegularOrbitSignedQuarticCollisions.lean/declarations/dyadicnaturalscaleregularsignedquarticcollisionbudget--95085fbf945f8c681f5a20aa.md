## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d1d852b3bc124c3fe8f9e773f8f126f60ea6ffbf2cc22952e3309cf4b783b5ab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 245–253.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def DyadicNaturalScaleRegularSignedQuarticCollisionBudget : Prop :=
  ∀ δ : ℝ, 0 < δ → ∃ C : ℝ, 0 ≤ C ∧
    ∀ j b : ℕ,
      b ∈ Finset.Ico (2 ^ j) (2 ^ (j + 1)) →
      twoNonunitRegularSignedQuarticCollisionEndpointMajorant b ≤
        C * (((2 ^ j : ℕ) : ℝ)) *
          (((2 ^ j : ℕ) : ℝ) ^ δ)

/-- Exact equivalence of the residue-L2 and quartic-collision suppliers. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Moebius/RegularOrbitSignedQuarticCollisions.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Moebius/RegularOrbitSignedQuarticCollisions.lean#L245).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ebc689c713c4dbf69e54c97b594ba519c2f5bd4f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
