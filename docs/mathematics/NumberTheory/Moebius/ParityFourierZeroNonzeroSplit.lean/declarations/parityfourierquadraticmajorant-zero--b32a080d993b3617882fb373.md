## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:697d2e72-4958-4f65-5883-92ee7561b5c1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 80–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem parityFourierQuadraticMajorant_zero
    (b d : ℕ) [NeZero d] :
    parityFourierQuadraticMajorant b d (0 : ZMod (d * d)) =
      parityFourierZeroModeQuadraticMajorant b := by
  unfold parityFourierQuadraticMajorant
    parityFourierZeroModeQuadraticMajorant
  rw [parityOnePointMobiusFourierSum_zero,
    parityOnePointMobiusFourierDiagonal_zero,
    parityOnePointMobiusFourierSum_zero,
    parityOnePointMobiusFourierDiagonal_zero]

/-- Nonzero frequencies modulo the exact square modulus. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Moebius/ParityFourierZeroNonzeroSplit.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Moebius/ParityFourierZeroNonzeroSplit.lean#L80).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `94e323e1acfbe7953960e1f507636a8d486aa8f4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
