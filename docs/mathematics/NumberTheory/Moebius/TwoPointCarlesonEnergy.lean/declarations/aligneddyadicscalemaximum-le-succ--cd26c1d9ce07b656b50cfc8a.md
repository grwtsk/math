## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b3e54516-324b-7d7f-48b6-780ee3393fed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 86–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem alignedDyadicScaleMaximum_le_succ
    (m r : ℕ) (a : ℕ → ℝ) (hr : r ≤ m) :
    alignedDyadicScaleMaximum m r a ≤
      alignedDyadicScaleMaximum (m + 1) r a := by
  unfold alignedDyadicScaleMaximum
  refine Finset.sup'_le _ _ ?_
  intro q hq
  apply Finset.le_sup' (fun t => |alignedDyadicBlockSum a r t|) (b := q)
  apply Finset.mem_range.mpr
  have hq' := Finset.mem_range.mp hq
  have hsub : m + 1 - r = (m - r) + 1 := by omega
  rw [hsub, Nat.pow_succ]
  omega

/-- The maximum of the right half at any old scale is bounded by the
corresponding maximum in the complete successor interval. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Moebius/TwoPointCarlesonEnergy.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Moebius/TwoPointCarlesonEnergy.lean#L86).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9419fe18fbf54d5842c11da5176674023e905e00` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
