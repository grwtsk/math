## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b903fec2-1735-44cf-713d-5fa842eb6296`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–64.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem derivativeBound {R M r r' : ℝ} {z : ℂ} {f : ℂ → ℂ}
    (analytic_f : AnalyticOn ℂ f (Metric.closedBall 0 R)) (f_zero_at_zero : f 0 = 0)
    (re_f_le_M : ∀ z ∈ Metric.closedBall 0 R, (f z).re ≤ M) (pos_r : 0 < r)
    (z_in_r : z ∈ Metric.closedBall 0 r) (r_le_r' : r < r') (r'_le_R : r' < R) :
    ‖(deriv f) z‖ ≤ 2 * M * (r')^2 / ((R - r') * (r' - r)^2) := by sorry
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/DerivativeBound/Variant9bd6293bef812c70c998a7eb7c9a8ed6b4ea1612a3b4d26053c575fbd161ab04.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/DerivativeBound/Variant9bd6293bef812c70c998a7eb7c9a8ed6b4ea1612a3b4d26053c575fbd161ab04.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `48bb7940f906548d6b15cd41978ba8bc8a127f46` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
