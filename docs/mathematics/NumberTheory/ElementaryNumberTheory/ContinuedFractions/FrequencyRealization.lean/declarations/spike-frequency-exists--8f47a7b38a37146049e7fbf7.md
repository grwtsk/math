## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fa89dc27-5125-806c-e3bf-b673c257175d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 324–338.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem spike_frequency_exists (gamma : ℕ → ℝ) (hgamma : ∀ n, 0 ≤ gamma n) :
    ∃ alpha : ℝ, 0 < alpha ∧ alpha < 1 ∧ Irrational alpha ∧
      FrequencyRealization (spikePartialQuotient gamma) alpha ∧
      frequencyExponent alpha = limsup (fun n ↦ ENNReal.ofReal (gamma n)) atTop := by
  have ha : ∀ n, 0 < spikePartialQuotient gamma n :=
    fun n ↦ spikeCoefficient_pos (gamma n) _
  let alpha := realizedFrequency (spikePartialQuotient gamma) ha
  have hr : FrequencyRealization (spikePartialQuotient gamma) alpha :=
    realizedFrequency_realization _ ha
  have hb := realizedFrequency_bounds (spikePartialQuotient gamma) ha
  refine ⟨alpha, hb.1, hb.2, frequency_irrational hr, hr, ?_⟩
  rw [frequencyExponent_eq hr, ← spikeDenominator_identifies]
  exact spikeDenominator_exponent gamma hgamma

/-- Sparse spikes realize the effective-strength limsup, including an infinite value. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ContinuedFractions/FrequencyRealization.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ContinuedFractions/FrequencyRealization.lean#L324).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9dfe868ea52027095f1c600ae0983ff6f22db1b4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
