## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c534efe5-9ec2-9633-bd37-756a8c81a82c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 366–375.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (hmul : ∀ {m n}, Nat.Coprime m n → f (m * n) = f m * f n) {p : ℕ} (hp : p.Prime) (e : ℕ)
    {m : p.smoothNumbers} :
    f (p ^ e * m) = f (p ^ e) * f m :=

/-- We establish the bijection from `ℕ × smoothNumbers p` to `smoothNumbers (p+1)`
given by `(e, n) ↦ p^e * n` when `p` is a prime. See `Nat.smoothNumbers_succ` for
when `p` is not prime. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/SmoothNumbers/Variantbb88dd2c9fcc2d9768a7e0d19fea4a306d50f27eb8d88aa7b3ffc2fddbf450ad.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/SmoothNumbers/Variantbb88dd2c9fcc2d9768a7e0d19fea4a306d50f27eb8d88aa7b3ffc2fddbf450ad.lean#L366).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `751fa97f4ef7f27f3c4b9addb4c168314569c3fe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
