## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cc95bd3f-f1a9-802d-2732-365bc03e8b6b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 138–152.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem finiteSquarefreeDensity_two_error_le_half_cutoff (h D : ℕ)
    (hh : Nat.Coprime 2 h) (hh1 : 1 ≤ h) (hD : 2 ≤ D) :
    |SquarefreeCount.finiteSquarefreeDensity (2 * h) D -
      (2 / 3 : ℝ) * SquarefreeCount.finiteSquarefreeDensity h D| ≤
      1 / (6 * (D / 2 : ℕ)) := by
  rw [finiteSquarefreeDensity_two_error_eq h D hh, abs_mul, abs_neg,
    abs_of_nonneg (div_nonneg (CoprimeCount.coprimeDensity_nonneg h hh1) (by norm_num))]
  have hcoeff : CoprimeCount.coprimeDensity h / 6 ≤ (1/6:ℝ) := by
    exact div_le_div_of_nonneg_right (CoprimeCount.coprimeDensity_le_one h hh1) (by norm_num)
  calc
    _ ≤ (1/6:ℝ)*(1/(D/2:ℕ)) := mul_le_mul hcoeff
      (coprimeReciprocalSquareSum_tail_abs_le (2*h) (D/2) D (by omega)
        (Nat.div_le_self D 2)) (abs_nonneg _) (by norm_num)
    _ = _ := by ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/FiniteDensityInsertionAudit/Variant3989f68719498cd418e06754f4f598023b4db64010052e5049eac5c7fe11fff8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/FiniteDensityInsertionAudit/Variant3989f68719498cd418e06754f4f598023b4db64010052e5049eac5c7fe11fff8.lean#L138).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2b20d07e9f1957b1a561ded3b6c086a9bf30e4c5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
