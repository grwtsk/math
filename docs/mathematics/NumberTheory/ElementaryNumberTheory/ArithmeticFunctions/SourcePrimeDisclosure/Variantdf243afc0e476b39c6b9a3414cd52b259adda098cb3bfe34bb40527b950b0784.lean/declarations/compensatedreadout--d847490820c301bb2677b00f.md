## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:904c77bffffcf5c6f08132dcefbd3a33b6989fc697fe7f586c480d1c64d118ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 239–244.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def compensatedReadout (q : ComplexL2) (I : Finset ℕ)
    (a b : ℕ → ℂ) (M : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  (⟪finiteProfile q I false false a,
    reflection (finiteProfile q I false false b)⟫_ℂ).re - physicalDiagonal q I a b - M

/-- The full source correction, physical deleted diagonal and independently fixed M travel together. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/SourcePrimeDisclosure/Variantdf243afc0e476b39c6b9a3414cd52b259adda098cb3bfe34bb40527b950b0784.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/SourcePrimeDisclosure/Variantdf243afc0e476b39c6b9a3414cd52b259adda098cb3bfe34bb40527b950b0784.lean#L239).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `191d9f886637eb847e7e25f8ba5f7d1724891606` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
