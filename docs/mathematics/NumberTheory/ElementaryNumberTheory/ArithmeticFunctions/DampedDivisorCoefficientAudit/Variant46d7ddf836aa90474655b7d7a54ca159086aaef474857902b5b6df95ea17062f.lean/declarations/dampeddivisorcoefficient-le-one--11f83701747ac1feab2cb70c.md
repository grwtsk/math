## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8b11f8b8-e9ab-7553-98bd-cf26adbbf3f2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 98–109.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dampedDivisorCoefficient_le_one (ε : ℝ) (hε : 0 ≤ ε) (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 ≤ n) :
    dampedDivisorCoefficient ε n ≤ 1 := by
  rw [dampedDivisorCoefficient_eq_primeFactors_prod ε n hn]
  apply Finset.prod_le_one
  · intro p hp
    have hp1 : (1 : ℝ) ≤ p := by exact_mod_cast (Nat.prime_of_mem_primeFactors hp).one_le
    exact sub_nonneg.mpr (Real.exp_le_one_iff.mpr
      (mul_nonpos_of_nonpos_of_nonneg (neg_nonpos.mpr hε) (Real.log_nonneg hp1)))
  · intro p _
    exact sub_le_self _ (Real.exp_nonneg _)

/-- At zero damping the original divisor sum is exactly the unit arithmetic function. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/DampedDivisorCoefficientAudit/Variant46d7ddf836aa90474655b7d7a54ca159086aaef474857902b5b6df95ea17062f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/DampedDivisorCoefficientAudit/Variant46d7ddf836aa90474655b7d7a54ca159086aaef474857902b5b6df95ea17062f.lean#L98).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fad4c5434b98c37dba23395f9bb0ffdad7275268` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
