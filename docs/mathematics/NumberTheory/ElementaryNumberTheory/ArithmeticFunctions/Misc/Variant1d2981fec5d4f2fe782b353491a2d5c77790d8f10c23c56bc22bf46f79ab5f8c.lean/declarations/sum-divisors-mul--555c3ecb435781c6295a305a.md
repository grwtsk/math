## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ff0770fb-08a6-d7d4-4ad2-cf91bee75e8d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 456–466.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sum_divisors_mul {m n : ℕ} (hmn : m.Coprime n) :
    ∑ d ∈ (m * n).divisors, d = (∑ d ∈ m.divisors, d) * ∑ d ∈ n.divisors, d := by
  simp only [← sigma_one_apply, isMultiplicative_sigma.map_mul_of_coprime hmn]

end Nat.Coprime

namespace Mathlib.Meta.Positivity
open Lean Qq

/-- Extension for `ArithmeticFunction.sigma`. -/
@[positivity ArithmeticFunction.sigma _ _]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/Misc/Variant1d2981fec5d4f2fe782b353491a2d5c77790d8f10c23c56bc22bf46f79ab5f8c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/Misc/Variant1d2981fec5d4f2fe782b353491a2d5c77790d8f10c23c56bc22bf46f79ab5f8c.lean#L456).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c0d23d008b5d336f0cdd42ad3a60acefe06066b5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
