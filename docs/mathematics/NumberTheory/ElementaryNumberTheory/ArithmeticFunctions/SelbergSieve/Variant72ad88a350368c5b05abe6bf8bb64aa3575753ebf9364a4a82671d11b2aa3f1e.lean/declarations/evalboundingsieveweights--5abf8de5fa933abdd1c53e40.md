## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e9aefe713e25935648dda68e0f5f6440c9c8dfdd068a6bd82a4126f6932d6cbf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 106–132.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def evalBoundingSieveWeights : PositivityExt where eval {u α} _zα _pα e := do
  match u, α, e with
  | 0, ~q(ℝ), ~q(@BoundingSieve.weights $i $n) =>
    assertInstancesCommute
    pure (.nonnegative q(BoundingSieve.weights_nonneg $n))
  | _, _, _ => throwError "not BoundingSieve.weights"

end Mathlib.Meta.Positivity

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/SelbergSieve/Variant72ad88a350368c5b05abe6bf8bb64aa3575753ebf9364a4a82671d11b2aa3f1e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/SelbergSieve/Variant72ad88a350368c5b05abe6bf8bb64aa3575753ebf9364a4a82671d11b2aa3f1e.lean#L106).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cdf08d2684dbe2489a9ec4e1962620dfd757db5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
