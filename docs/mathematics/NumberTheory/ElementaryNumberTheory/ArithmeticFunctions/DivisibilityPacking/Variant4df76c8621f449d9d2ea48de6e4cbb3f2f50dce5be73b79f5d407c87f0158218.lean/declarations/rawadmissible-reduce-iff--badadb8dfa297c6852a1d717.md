## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8be030fc-22fd-13c7-a382-0b4d3cfc32f1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 194–200.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rawAdmissible_reduce_iff (H : Finset ℤ) {y y' : ℕ} (hy : y ≤ y')
    (a : ZMod (Modulus y')) :
    RawAdmissible H y (reduction hy a) ↔
      ∀ p : primeSupport y,
        localReduction y' ⟨p, primeSupport_mono hy p.property⟩ a ∉ forbiddenResidues H p := by
  simp only [RawAdmissible, localReduction_reduction]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/DivisibilityPacking/Variant4df76c8621f449d9d2ea48de6e4cbb3f2f50dce5be73b79f5d407c87f0158218.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/DivisibilityPacking/Variant4df76c8621f449d9d2ea48de6e4cbb3f2f50dce5be73b79f5d407c87f0158218.lean#L194).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `582e7cb7ad24517acd7048a2a9450d7ac47ecc1f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
