## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:31b568bb-947e-7e51-c800-942743e8ddab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 27–37.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem damping_multiplicative (ε : ℝ) : (damping ε).IsMultiplicative := by
  rw [IsMultiplicative.iff_ne_zero]
  constructor
  · simp [damping]
  · intro m n hm hn _
    have hmR : (m : ℝ) ≠ 0 := by exact_mod_cast hm
    have hnR : (n : ℝ) ≠ 0 := by exact_mod_cast hn
    simp only [damping, ArithmeticFunction.coe_mk, if_neg hm, if_neg hn,
      if_neg (mul_ne_zero hm hn), Nat.cast_mul]
    rw [Real.log_mul hmR hnR, mul_add, Real.exp_add]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/DampedDivisorPrimePower/Variant1a77aed93f82708c4e8f7c8c96aeadf1ee2925005102af9b4f410359bebb4c97.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/DampedDivisorPrimePower/Variant1a77aed93f82708c4e8f7c8c96aeadf1ee2925005102af9b4f410359bebb4c97.lean#L27).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f3af00287fbfc5483d68a6e1f6c28b4ef410eea8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
