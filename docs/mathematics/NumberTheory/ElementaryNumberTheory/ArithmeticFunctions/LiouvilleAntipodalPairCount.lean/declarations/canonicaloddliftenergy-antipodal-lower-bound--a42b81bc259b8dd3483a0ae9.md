## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:735609d9-4cee-95c5-411b-6f06c81c971f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 642–657.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem canonicalOddLiftEnergy_antipodal_lower_bound
    (M : ℕ) (H : Finset ℕ) (hM : 0 < M) :
    liouvilleAllOrderEnergy M H +
      oddResidualAllOrderEnergy M H - 2 ≤
        (4 : ℚ) *
          liouvilleAllOrderEnergy (2 * M) (oddLiftOffsets H) := by

/-- Exact necessary-and-sufficient antipodal-count criterion for a
canonical odd-lifted all-order energy threshold. No arithmetic
smallness assumption is constructed by this equivalence. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/LiouvilleAntipodalPairCount.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/LiouvilleAntipodalPairCount.lean#L642).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f8a3e4dc67c47ba68cc588cb5d61ab5e41c6c6c3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
