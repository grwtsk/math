## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:88d8a4a1-2f3a-9c09-8690-1e66d4aa1036`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 321–338.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sum_powerset_eq_subtype_sum
    (H : Finset ℕ) (f : Finset ℕ → ℚ) :
    (∑ T ∈ H.powerset, f T) =
      ∑ S : Finset {h : ℕ // h ∈ H}, f (shiftSubsetValues H S) := by
  classical
  let e := shiftPowersetEquiv H
  have hsum :
      (∑ T : {T : Finset ℕ // T ⊆ H}, f T.val) =
        ∑ S : Finset {h : ℕ // h ∈ H}, f (shiftSubsetValues H S) := by
    exact Equiv.sum_comp e (fun T => f T.val)
  calc
    (∑ T ∈ H.powerset, f T) =
        ∑ T : {T : Finset ℕ // T ⊆ H}, f T.val := by
      exact Finset.sum_attach H.powerset (fun T => f T)
    _ = _ := hsum

/-- The antipodal collision count is bounded by the number of
ordered root pairs. This does not assume cancellation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/LiouvilleAntipodalPairCount.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/LiouvilleAntipodalPairCount.lean#L321).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f8a3e4dc67c47ba68cc588cb5d61ab5e41c6c6c3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
