## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b7a33b04d1ad264594f38c7f10c406f0b8e9aa931093b905885f6354523616ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 362–372.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def muFun (a : α) : α → 𝕜
  | b =>
    if a = b then 1
    else
      -∑ x ∈ (Ico a b).attach,
          let h := mem_Ico.1 x.2
          have : (Icc a x).card < (Icc a b).card :=
            card_lt_card (Icc_ssubset_Icc_right (h.1.trans h.2.le) le_rfl h.2)
          muFun a x
termination_by b => (Icc a b).card

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/IncidenceAlgebra/Variantd777e5002b0ad90f9d0f360e8c1ef5b5c32729d9613adc45203116401012ee8d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/IncidenceAlgebra/Variantd777e5002b0ad90f9d0f360e8c1ef5b5c32729d9613adc45203116401012ee8d.lean#L362).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `42479a7ca982e93ff74a45317b33e66766138651` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
