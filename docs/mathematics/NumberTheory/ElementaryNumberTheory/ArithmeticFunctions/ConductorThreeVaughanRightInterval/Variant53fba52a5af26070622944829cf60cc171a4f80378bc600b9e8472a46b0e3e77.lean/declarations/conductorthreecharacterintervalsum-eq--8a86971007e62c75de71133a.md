## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b4cf2bd4-3478-91c8-def5-726fcb5942fc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 45–59.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem conductorThreeCharacterIntervalSum_eq
    {a b : ℕ} (hab : a ≤ b) :
    conductorThreeCharacterIntervalSum a b =
      conductorThreeCharacterPartialSum (b + 1) -
        conductorThreeCharacterPartialSum (a + 1) := by
  rw [conductorThreeCharacterIntervalSum]
  have hfinset : Finset.Ioc a b = Finset.Ico (a + 1) (b + 1) := by
    ext n
    simp only [Finset.mem_Ioc, Finset.mem_Ico]
    omega
  rw [hfinset, Finset.sum_Ico_eq_sub _ (by omega)]
  rfl

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/ConductorThreeVaughanRightInterval/Variant53fba52a5af26070622944829cf60cc171a4f80378bc600b9e8472a46b0e3e77.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/ConductorThreeVaughanRightInterval/Variant53fba52a5af26070622944829cf60cc171a4f80378bc600b9e8472a46b0e3e77.lean#L45).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8482ffe7663fa2cc0e6bdd8498ff64234a23b704` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
