## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:af37c072-82a7-c95e-064d-f0203348ffa5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 110–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem proportionalLiouvilleMean_eq_neg_one (M : ℕ) (hM : 0 < M) :
    proportionalLiouvilleMean M = (-1 : ℚ) := by
  have hM0 : (M : ℚ) ≠ 0 := by
    exact_mod_cast (Nat.ne_of_gt hM)
  have hp :
      (∑ n ∈ Finset.range M,
          (((ArithmeticFunction.liouville (n + 1) : ℤ) : ℚ) *
            ((ArithmeticFunction.liouville (2 * (n + 1)) : ℤ) : ℚ))) =
        -(M : ℚ) := by
    exact_mod_cast liouville_proportional_prefix M

  apply (div_eq_iff hM0).2
  ring

/-- A bound below one cannot hold for the normalized proportional pair.
This is a negative control on any would-be 'all affine forms' adapter. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/LiouvilleDyadicAffineBridge.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/LiouvilleDyadicAffineBridge.lean#L110).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `413654e13fbf04087bd6aef6b1bf1621aee01eb4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
