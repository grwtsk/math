## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e3b0a0fa-01ea-db53-7c9b-ddba49905d7f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 154–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem totient_div_of_dvd {n d : ℕ} (hnd : d ∣ n) :
    φ (n / d) = #{k ∈ range n | n.gcd k = d} := by
  rcases d.eq_zero_or_pos with (rfl | hd0); · simp [eq_zero_of_zero_dvd hnd]
  rcases hnd with ⟨x, rfl⟩
  rw [Nat.mul_div_cancel_left x hd0]
  apply Finset.card_bij fun k _ => d * k
  · simp only [mem_filter, mem_range, and_imp, Coprime]
    refine fun a ha1 ha2 => ⟨by gcongr, ?_⟩
    rw [gcd_mul_left, ha2, mul_one]
  · simp [hd0.ne']
  · simp only [mem_filter, mem_range, exists_prop, and_imp]
    intro b hb1 hb2
    have : d ∣ b := by
      rw [← hb2]
      apply gcd_dvd_right
    rcases this with ⟨q, rfl⟩
    refine ⟨q, ⟨⟨(mul_lt_mul_iff_right₀ hd0).1 hb1, ?_⟩, rfl⟩⟩
    rwa [gcd_mul_left, mul_eq_left hd0.ne'] at hb2

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/Totient/Variant05e84b831a915b5e4569cc5576419c7754e38f89ab74dd7f5bf641b006977eab.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/Totient/Variant05e84b831a915b5e4569cc5576419c7754e38f89ab74dd7f5bf641b006977eab.lean#L154).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1adf8f725fd231a0df73efdb6bf812ee0865c6d0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
