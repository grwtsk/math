## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2e28164f-118b-dd1a-8aee-4a94a3395073`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 59–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem complexLiouvilleAffineSum_eq_cast
    (a₁ a₂ b₁ b₂ N : ℕ) :
    complexLiouvilleAffineSum a₁ a₂ b₁ b₂ N =
      ((∑ m ∈ Finset.Icc 1 N,
          ArithmeticFunction.liouville (a₁ * m + b₁) *
            ArithmeticFunction.liouville (a₂ * m + b₂) : ℤ) : ℂ) := by
  unfold complexLiouvilleAffineSum liouvilleComplex
  rw [Int.cast_sum]
  apply Finset.sum_congr rfl
  intro m _
  rw [Int.cast_mul]

/-- Exact, finite and independent of any arithmetic cancellation:
replace the 0-based root n<N by the positive affine root m=n+1.
The endpoint N is unchanged. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/LiouvilleFixedFormComplexAdapter.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/LiouvilleFixedFormComplexAdapter.lean#L59).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1d6501c4118d9795a840281520d2020789881349` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
