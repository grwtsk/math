## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8f982877-619c-1266-b170-29f813ccce84`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 85–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem natural_division_error (j e : ℕ) (he : 1 ≤ e) :
    |((j / e : ℕ) : ℝ) - (j : ℝ) / (e : ℝ)| ≤ 1 := by
  have he0 : (0 : ℝ) < e := by exact_mod_cast (show 0 < e by omega)
  have hx : 0 ≤ (j : ℝ) / (e : ℝ) := div_nonneg (Nat.cast_nonneg j) he0.le
  have hl := Nat.floor_le hx
  have hu := Nat.lt_floor_add_one ((j : ℝ) / (e : ℝ))
  rw [Nat.floor_div_eq_div] at hl hu
  exact abs_le.mpr ⟨by linarith, by linarith⟩

/-- The error in the finite coprime density is bounded by the actual divisor count. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/CoprimeCount/Variant906d9e561d015adc59e33f90c4d8f783f6fa54dcd91bb96d87a16c6fdf12d9a7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ArithmeticFunctions/CoprimeCount/Variant906d9e561d015adc59e33f90c4d8f783f6fa54dcd91bb96d87a16c6fdf12d9a7.lean#L85).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5f8dd8dc7e4bc54d6a738d693dcb40e932c7846d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
