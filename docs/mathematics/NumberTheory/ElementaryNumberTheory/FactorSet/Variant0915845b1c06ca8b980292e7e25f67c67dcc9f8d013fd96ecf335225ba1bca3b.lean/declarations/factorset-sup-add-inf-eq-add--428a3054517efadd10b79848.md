## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c4fde5d-a507-af21-a652-e5d467bc4014`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–66.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    ∀ a b : FactorSet α, a ⊔ b + a ⊓ b = a + b
  | ⊤, b => show ⊤ ⊔ b + ⊤ ⊓ b = ⊤ + b by simp
  | a, ⊤ => show a ⊔ ⊤ + a ⊓ ⊤ = a + ⊤ by simp
  | WithTop.some a, WithTop.some b =>
    show (a : FactorSet α) ⊔ b + (a : FactorSet α) ⊓ b = a + b by

      exact Multiset.union_add_inter _ _

/-- Evaluates the product of a `FactorSet` to be the product of the corresponding multiset,
  or `0` if there is none. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/FactorSet/Variant0915845b1c06ca8b980292e7e25f67c67dcc9f8d013fd96ecf335225ba1bca3b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/FactorSet/Variant0915845b1c06ca8b980292e7e25f67c67dcc9f8d013fd96ecf335225ba1bca3b.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3cda168dc997f94708de17fc0deb391b229655ac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
