## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cc3e2c87-ddd3-4519-198d-ed738013b93b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 99–112.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem FactorSet.prod_eq_zero_iff [IsCancelMulZero α] [Nontrivial α] (p : FactorSet α) :
    p.prod = 0 ↔ p = ⊤ := by
  unfold FactorSet at p
  induction p  -- TODO: `induction_eliminator` doesn't work with `abbrev`
  · simp only [Associates.prod_top]
  · rw [prod_coe, Multiset.prod_eq_zero_iff, Multiset.mem_map, eq_false WithTop.coe_ne_top,
      iff_false, not_exists]
    exact fun a => not_and_of_not_right _ a.prop.ne_zero

section count

variable [DecidableEq (Associates α)]

/-- `bcount p s` is the multiplicity of `p` in the FactorSet `s` (with bundled `p`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/FactorSet/Variant58f16d1ff65f6f712c3d7cce9bfb58a0f1fbf57f58ff57b586010e243f8b70e9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/FactorSet/Variant58f16d1ff65f6f712c3d7cce9bfb58a0f1fbf57f58ff57b586010e243f8b70e9.lean#L99).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5a632ba834bc4615833f952e11e8745f1bcc9bb1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
