## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1010e587-71b5-8993-39cb-35953b28c7a5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 385–393.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem frequently_atTop_fermatPsp {b : ℕ} (h : 1 ≤ b) : ∃ᶠ n in Filter.atTop, FermatPsp n b := by
  -- Based on the proof of `Nat.frequently_atTop_modEq_one`
  refine' Filter.frequently_atTop.2 fun n => _
  obtain ⟨p, hp⟩ := exists_infinite_pseudoprimes h n
  exact ⟨p, hp.2, hp.1⟩
#align fermat_psp.frequently_at_top_fermat_psp Nat.frequently_atTop_fermatPsp

/-- Infinite set variant of `Nat.exists_infinite_pseudoprimes`
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/FermatPsp/Variant14bbde606b0c7a65de0ecca5f9b4bc2ded821948d8ec09d93d01c58066132fea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/FermatPsp/Variant14bbde606b0c7a65de0ecca5f9b4bc2ded821948d8ec09d93d01c58066132fea.lean#L385).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a3d1a3a63870f31fa0ed99f1ad87004b000a2898` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
