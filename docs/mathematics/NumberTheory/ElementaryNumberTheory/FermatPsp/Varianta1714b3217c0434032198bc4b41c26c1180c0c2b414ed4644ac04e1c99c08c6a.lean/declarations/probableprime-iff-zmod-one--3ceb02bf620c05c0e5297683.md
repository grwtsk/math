## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:96749934-c0e9-d99b-36f1-9d3bb98faa79`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–66.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem probablePrime_iff_zmod_one (n : ℕ) {b : ℕ} (hb : b ≠ 0) :
    n.ProbablePrime b ↔ (b : ZMod n) ^ (n - 1) = 1 := by
  rw [ProbablePrime, ← ZMod.natCast_eq_zero_iff, cast_pred (by positivity), sub_eq_zero, cast_pow]

/--
`n` is a Fermat pseudoprime to base `b` if `n` is a probable prime to base `b` and is composite. By
this definition, all composite natural numbers are pseudoprimes to base 0 and 1. This definition
also permits `n` to be less than `b`, so that 4 is a pseudoprime to base 5, for example.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/FermatPsp/Varianta1714b3217c0434032198bc4b41c26c1180c0c2b414ed4644ac04e1c99c08c6a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/FermatPsp/Varianta1714b3217c0434032198bc4b41c26c1180c0c2b414ed4644ac04e1c99c08c6a.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d7ab78ff65ee83ba68b27eec272f829a971f7316` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
