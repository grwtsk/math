## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:89d20ae5-104b-2468-d443-66cdf2648ca2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 188–196.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem perm_primeFactorsList_mul {a b : ℕ} (ha : a ≠ 0) (hb : b ≠ 0) :
    (a * b).primeFactorsList ~ a.primeFactorsList ++ b.primeFactorsList := by
  refine (primeFactorsList_unique ?_ ?_).symm
  · rw [List.prod_append, prod_primeFactorsList ha, prod_primeFactorsList hb]
  · intro p hp
    rw [List.mem_append] at hp
    rcases hp with hp' | hp' <;> exact prime_of_mem_primeFactorsList hp'

/-- For coprime `a` and `b`, the prime factors of `a * b` are the union of those of `a` and `b` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Factors/Variant3f5e288cd5978ec33b4bc12a1e376112a13afed34f223f394bdb4abb592f4adc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Factors/Variant3f5e288cd5978ec33b4bc12a1e376112a13afed34f223f394bdb4abb592f4adc.lean#L188).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a8e6a64787a3b19c4b4eb7c2289bf8c3f200f13` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
