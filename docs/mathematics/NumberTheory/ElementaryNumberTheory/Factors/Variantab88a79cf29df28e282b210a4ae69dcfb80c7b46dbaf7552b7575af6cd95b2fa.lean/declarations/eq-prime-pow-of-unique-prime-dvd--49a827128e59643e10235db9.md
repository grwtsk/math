## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2cb7e7e8-b088-edf9-d418-fb374a1d3175`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 196–203.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_prime_pow_of_unique_prime_dvd {n p : ℕ} (hpos : n ≠ 0)
    (h : ∀ {d}, Nat.Prime d → d ∣ n → d = p) : n = p ^ n.factors.length := by
  set k := n.factors.length
  rw [← prod_factors hpos, ← prod_replicate k p,
    eq_replicate_of_mem fun d hd => h (prime_of_mem_factors hd) (dvd_of_mem_factors hd)]
#align nat.eq_prime_pow_of_unique_prime_dvd Nat.eq_prime_pow_of_unique_prime_dvd

/-- For positive `a` and `b`, the prime factors of `a * b` are the union of those of `a` and `b` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Factors/Variantab88a79cf29df28e282b210a4ae69dcfb80c7b46dbaf7552b7575af6cd95b2fa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Factors/Variantab88a79cf29df28e282b210a4ae69dcfb80c7b46dbaf7552b7575af6cd95b2fa.lean#L196).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `61480fd1cda78e26e1d79c5d082648564f7bf1e5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
