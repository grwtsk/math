## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1415fa12bb5979f1c2ba49120017eb1770a4bc5cdaacbbff286a4c0a013682c7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 267–280.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def findNotPowerCertificateCore (m n : ℕ) : Option ℕ := Id.run do
  let mut left := 0
  let mut right := m + 1
  while right - left > 1 do
    let middle := (left + right) / 2
    if middle ^ n ≤ m then
      left := middle
    else
      right := middle
  if left ^ n < m then
    return .some left
  return .none

/-- Finds `NotPowerCertificate` showing that `m` is not `n`-power. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Irrational/Variant273bc59de3db478ecd2de066deb4d24b0c7cb845070b0748a27ebd76c9ad1ca2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Irrational/Variant273bc59de3db478ecd2de066deb4d24b0c7cb845070b0748a27ebd76c9ad1ca2.lean#L267).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `103159d7045d05f2907435acfc8c22bbd9b4c425` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
