## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9124b4ed-a876-5d31-b960-1740f78c0e7a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 65–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_two_pow_mul_odd {n : ℕ} (hpos : 0 < n) : ∃ k m : ℕ, n = 2 ^ k * m ∧ ¬Even m := by
  have h := Nat.finiteMultiplicity_iff.2 ⟨Nat.prime_two.ne_one, hpos⟩
  obtain ⟨m, hm⟩ := pow_multiplicity_dvd 2 n
  use multiplicity 2 n, m
  refine ⟨hm, ?_⟩
  rw [even_iff_two_dvd]
  have hg := h.not_pow_dvd_of_multiplicity_lt (Nat.lt_succ_self _)
  contrapose! hg
  rcases hg with ⟨k, rfl⟩
  apply Dvd.intro k
  rw [pow_succ, mul_assoc, ← hm]

  power of two times a Mersenne prime. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/PerfectNumbers/Variant0775028378dc2e384ddeb12b72477eb9b02786fdca367c3aa485294ae8afd2bc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/PerfectNumbers/Variant0775028378dc2e384ddeb12b72477eb9b02786fdca367c3aa485294ae8afd2bc.lean#L65).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f6b889750bac1df2a21d5d149047396e661157f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
