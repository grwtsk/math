## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7161b572-443c-f360-c033-3ead6b96e8bc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–81.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma primeFactors_eq_empty : n.primeFactors = ∅ ↔ n = 0 ∨ n = 1 := by
  constructor
  · contrapose!
    rintro hn
    obtain ⟨p, hp, hpn⟩ := exists_prime_and_dvd hn.2
    exact Nonempty.ne_empty <| ⟨_, mem_primeFactors.2 ⟨hp, hpn, hn.1⟩⟩
  · rintro (rfl | rfl) <;> simp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/PrimeFin/Variant071c5f0ac1131fc5bd16891bbe97c8440d842e415604391f6959597360aac076.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/PrimeFin/Variant071c5f0ac1131fc5bd16891bbe97c8440d842e415604391f6959597360aac076.lean#L73).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
