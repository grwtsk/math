## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5975c1c57bdec5c52afdfd2f29d7976948a18a8affaa45364c39ffef712c9a59`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 75–84.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def selbergWeights : ℕ → ℝ := fun d =>
  if d ∣ P then
    (ν d)⁻¹ * g d * μ d * S⁻¹ *
      ∑ m ∈ divisors P, if (d * m) ^ 2 ≤ y ∧ m.Coprime d then g m else 0
  else 0

-- This notation traditionally uses λ, which is unavailable in lean
set_option quotPrecheck false
local notation3 "γ" => SelbergSieve.selbergWeights s

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Selberg/Variant302d0df9535d48e2ef39a9e1f811c89fa7110f1b6aef6a90fa94de94f9f6929d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Selberg/Variant302d0df9535d48e2ef39a9e1f811c89fa7110f1b6aef6a90fa94de94f9f6929d.lean#L75).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cc9e836a88d58c0c5d3b64f92aa8af485f891dce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
