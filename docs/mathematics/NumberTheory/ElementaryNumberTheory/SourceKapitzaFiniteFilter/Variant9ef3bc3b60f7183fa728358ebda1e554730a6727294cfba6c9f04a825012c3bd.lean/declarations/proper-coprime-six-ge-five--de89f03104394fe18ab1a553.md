## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b5f9dede-e662-fe75-3909-2f4433c3f98a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–62.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem proper_coprime_six_ge_five {m : ℕ} (hm : 2 ≤ m)
    (hcop : Nat.Coprime m 6) : 5 ≤ m := by
  by_contra h
  have hm4 : m ≤ 4 := by omega
  have cases : m = 2 ∨ m = 3 ∨ m = 4 := by omega
  rcases cases with h2 | h3 | h4
  · subst m; exact absurd hcop (by decide)
  · subst m; exact absurd hcop (by decide)
  · subst m; exact absurd hcop (by decide)

/-- Exact natural division makes ten the first possible product. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/SourceKapitzaFiniteFilter/Variant9ef3bc3b60f7183fa728358ebda1e554730a6727294cfba6c9f04a825012c3bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/SourceKapitzaFiniteFilter/Variant9ef3bc3b60f7183fa728358ebda1e554730a6727294cfba6c9f04a825012c3bd.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `760888a34439c2f473dd01b68ab12c537fb7e1c7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
