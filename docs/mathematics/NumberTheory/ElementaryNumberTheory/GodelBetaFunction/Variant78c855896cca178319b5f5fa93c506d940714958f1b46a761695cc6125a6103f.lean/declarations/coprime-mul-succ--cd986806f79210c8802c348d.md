## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4969342f-4da3-f4f2-3049-188c3dd87f8b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 57–70.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma coprime_mul_succ {n m a} (ha : m - n ∣ a) : Coprime (n * a + 1) (m * a + 1) :=
  Nat.coprime_of_dvd fun p pp hn hm => by
    have : p ∣ (m - n) * a := by
      simpa [Nat.succ_sub_succ, ← Nat.mul_sub_right_distrib] using
        Nat.dvd_sub hm hn
    have : p ∣ a := by
      rcases (Nat.Prime.dvd_mul pp).mp this with (hp | hp)
      · exact Nat.dvd_trans hp ha
      · exact hp
    apply pp.ne_one
    simpa [Nat.add_sub_cancel_left] using Nat.dvd_sub hn (this.mul_left n)

variable {m : ℕ}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/GodelBetaFunction/Variant78c855896cca178319b5f5fa93c506d940714958f1b46a761695cc6125a6103f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/GodelBetaFunction/Variant78c855896cca178319b5f5fa93c506d940714958f1b46a761695cc6125a6103f.lean#L57).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `09c6d004eb98c61135f507e6eaa25fffc389970b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
