## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:184adbcb-b3df-34d1-95d3-a6825eec0c8e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 83–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem wellFounded_associates : WellFounded ((· < ·) : Associates α → Associates α → Prop) :=
  Subrelation.wf dvdNotUnit_of_lt wellFounded_dvdNotUnit
#align wf_dvd_monoid.well_founded_associates WfDvdMonoid.wellFounded_associates

-- Porting note: elab_as_elim can only be global and cannot be changed on an imported decl
-- attribute [local elab_as_elim] WellFounded.fix

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/UniqueFactorizationDomain/Varianta54d7db19ad030215c333b0114699fbddc46b74365cdd188894a6fe8df929b61.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/UniqueFactorizationDomain/Varianta54d7db19ad030215c333b0114699fbddc46b74365cdd188894a6fe8df929b61.lean#L83).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cf401250dde34a934d25e304e587c93dabbe5bfd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
