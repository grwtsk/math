## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cb3be8f4-8be1-a66a-1441-10ba43309132`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 130–139.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsCoprime.mul_dvd (H : IsCoprime x y) (H1 : x ∣ z) (H2 : y ∣ z) : x * y ∣ z := by
  obtain ⟨a, b, h⟩ := H
  rw [← mul_one z, ← h, mul_add]
  apply dvd_add
  · rw [mul_comm z, mul_assoc]
    exact (mul_dvd_mul_left _ H2).mul_left _
  · rw [mul_comm b, ← mul_assoc]
    exact (mul_dvd_mul_right H1 _).mul_right _

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Varianta5f9359ad9af1920f145595776be9053a44976f346f2aac2ce453636482cf6e1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Varianta5f9359ad9af1920f145595776be9053a44976f346f2aac2ce453636482cf6e1.lean#L130).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3c18bcd97b3404d865f2f53eadece8348c66f351` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
