## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:96342a388f59ae0d1367f65aa1994c748eadf610434b1ac81292a8c5ac9a3cf5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–61.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : WfDvdMonoid ℕ :=
  ⟨by
    refine'
      RelHomClass.wellFounded
        (⟨fun x : ℕ => if x = 0 then (⊤ : ℕ∞) else x, _⟩ : DvdNotUnit →r (· < ·))
        (WithTop.wellFounded_lt Nat.lt_wfRel.wf)
    intro a b h
    cases' a with a
    · exfalso
      revert h
      simp [DvdNotUnit]
    cases b
    · simpa [succ_ne_zero] using WithTop.coe_lt_top (a + 1)
    cases' dvd_and_not_dvd_iff.2 h with h1 h2
    simp only [succ_ne_zero, cast_lt, if_false]
    refine lt_of_le_of_ne (Nat.le_of_dvd (Nat.succ_pos _) h1) fun con => h2 ?_
    rw [con]⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variant44e22c4fd7c572ec54817a2f9649be7dc3abf6f84798a79e55c776b24a71da32.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variant44e22c4fd7c572ec54817a2f9649be7dc3abf6f84798a79e55c776b24a71da32.lean#L44).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `089ad960e973126618ed8ba9d3fe31ee301744e3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
