## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bb3ea3ce-348b-440b-04a1-63f0062b6a54`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 512–520.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Icc_factorization_eq_pow_dvd (n : ℕ) {p : ℕ} (pp : Prime p) :
    Icc 1 (n.factorization p) = {i ∈ Ico 1 n | p ^ i ∣ n} := by
  rcases eq_or_ne n 0 with (rfl | hn)
  · simp
  ext x
  simp only [mem_Icc, Finset.mem_filter, mem_Ico, and_assoc, and_congr_right_iff,
    pp.pow_dvd_iff_le_factorization hn, iff_and_self]
  exact fun _ H => lt_of_le_of_lt H (factorization_lt p hn)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variant8429571eba95e3bb941fef05cfc72da872695013099e0bc2391a7300ce04ba75.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variant8429571eba95e3bb941fef05cfc72da872695013099e0bc2391a7300ce04ba75.lean#L512).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f9d5401d58708fe65e2b8b2cb94310a0513f412b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
