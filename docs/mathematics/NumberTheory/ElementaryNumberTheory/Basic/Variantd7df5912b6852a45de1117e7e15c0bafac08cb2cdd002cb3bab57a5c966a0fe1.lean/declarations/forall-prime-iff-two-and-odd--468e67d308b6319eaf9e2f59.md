## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e1aee864-7d21-7526-fa5e-6e1a6f755a6f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–128.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem forall_prime_iff_two_and_odd {P : ℕ → Prop} :
    (∀ p, p.Prime → P p) ↔ P 2 ∧ ∀ p, p.Prime → Odd p → P p := by
  refine ⟨fun h ↦ ⟨h 2 prime_two, fun p hp _ ↦ h p hp⟩, fun h p hp ↦ ?_⟩
  obtain rfl | hne := eq_or_ne p 2
  · exact h.1
  · exact h.2 p hp (hp.odd_of_ne_two hne)

/-- To prove a property of all primes, it is enough to prove it for `2` and for the odd primes. -/
alias ⟨_, forall_prime_of_two_of_odd⟩ := forall_prime_iff_two_and_odd

/-- A prime `p` satisfies `p % 2 = 1` if and only if `p ≠ 2`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variantd7df5912b6852a45de1117e7e15c0bafac08cb2cdd002cb3bab57a5c966a0fe1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variantd7df5912b6852a45de1117e7e15c0bafac08cb2cdd002cb3bab57a5c966a0fe1.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8ba57cfd458820ca15ce92e94c018394dc81a2db` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
