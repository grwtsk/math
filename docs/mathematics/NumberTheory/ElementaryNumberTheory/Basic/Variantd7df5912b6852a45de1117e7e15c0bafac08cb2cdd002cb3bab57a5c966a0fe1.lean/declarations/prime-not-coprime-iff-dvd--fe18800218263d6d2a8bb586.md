## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:02a4a142-1951-8d74-f431-c747dc82f5dd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 140–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Prime.not_coprime_iff_dvd {m n : ℕ} : ¬Coprime m n ↔ ∃ p, Prime p ∧ p ∣ m ∧ p ∣ n := by
  apply Iff.intro
  · intro h
    exact
      ⟨minFac (gcd m n), minFac_prime h, (minFac_dvd (gcd m n)).trans (gcd_dvd_left m n),
        (minFac_dvd (gcd m n)).trans (gcd_dvd_right m n)⟩
  · intro h
    obtain ⟨p, hp⟩ := h
    apply Nat.not_coprime_of_dvd_of_dvd (Prime.one_lt hp.1) hp.2.1 hp.2.2

/-- If `0 < m < minFac n`, then `n` and `m` are coprime. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variantd7df5912b6852a45de1117e7e15c0bafac08cb2cdd002cb3bab57a5c966a0fe1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variantd7df5912b6852a45de1117e7e15c0bafac08cb2cdd002cb3bab57a5c966a0fe1.lean#L140).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8ba57cfd458820ca15ce92e94c018394dc81a2db` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
