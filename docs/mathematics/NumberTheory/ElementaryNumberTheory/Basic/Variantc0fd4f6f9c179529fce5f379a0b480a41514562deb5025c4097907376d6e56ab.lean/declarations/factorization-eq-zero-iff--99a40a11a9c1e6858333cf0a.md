## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:719950a0-64ac-8fe2-c267-64e4d31b4fd7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 216–225.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem factorization_eq_zero_iff' (n : ℕ) : n.factorization = 0 ↔ n = 0 ∨ n = 1 := by
  rw [factorization_eq_factors_multiset n]
  simp [factorization, AddEquiv.map_eq_zero_iff, Multiset.coe_eq_zero]
#align nat.factorization_eq_zero_iff' Nat.factorization_eq_zero_iff'

/-! ## Lemmas about factorizations of products and powers -/


/-- For nonzero `a` and `b`, the power of `p` in `a * b` is the sum of the powers in `a` and `b` -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variantc0fd4f6f9c179529fce5f379a0b480a41514562deb5025c4097907376d6e56ab.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variantc0fd4f6f9c179529fce5f379a0b480a41514562deb5025c4097907376d6e56ab.lean#L216).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f18b7d1f78c30a8108c9805ec5f0a01f5048f219` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
