## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dea4d14b103292aab0eeffbca678991feae79af783929b87c57292beedcf5656`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 862–874.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def recOnMul {P : ℕ → Sort*} (h0 : P 0) (h1 : P 1) (hp : ∀ p, Prime p → P p)
    (h : ∀ a b, P a → P b → P (a * b)) : ∀ a, P a :=
  let hp : ∀ p n : ℕ, Prime p → P (p ^ n) := fun p n hp' =>
    n.recOn h1 (fun n hn => by rw [pow_succ]; apply h _ _ hn (hp p hp'))
    -- Porting note: was
    -- match n with
    -- | 0 => h1
    -- | n + 1 => h _ _ (hp p hp') (_match _)
  recOnPrimeCoprime h0 hp fun a b _ _ _ => h a b
#align nat.rec_on_mul Nat.recOnMul

/-- For any multiplicative function `f` with `f 1 = 1` and any `n ≠ 0`,
we can evaluate `f n` by evaluating `f` at `p ^ k` over the factorization of `n` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variantc0fd4f6f9c179529fce5f379a0b480a41514562deb5025c4097907376d6e56ab.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variantc0fd4f6f9c179529fce5f379a0b480a41514562deb5025c4097907376d6e56ab.lean#L862).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f18b7d1f78c30a8108c9805ec5f0a01f5048f219` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
