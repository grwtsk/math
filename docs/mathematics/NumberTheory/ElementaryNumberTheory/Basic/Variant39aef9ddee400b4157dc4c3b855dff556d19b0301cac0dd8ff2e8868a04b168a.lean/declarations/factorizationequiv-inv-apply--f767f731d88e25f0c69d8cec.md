## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ccef155a-7ea4-04e6-11fe-261bd4c34f45`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 334–354.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (factorizationEquiv.symm ⟨f, hf⟩).1 = f.prod (· ^ ·) :=
  rfl
#align nat.factorization_equiv_inv_apply Nat.factorizationEquiv_inv_apply

/-! ### Generalisation of the "even part" and "odd part" of a natural number

We introduce the notations `ord_proj[p] n` for the largest power of the prime `p` that
divides `n` and `ord_compl[p] n` for the complementary part. The `ord` naming comes from
the $p$-adic order/valuation of a number, and `proj` and `compl` are for the projection and
complementary projection. The term `n.factorization p` is the $p$-adic order itself.
For example, `ord_proj[2] n` is the even part of `n` and `ord_compl[2] n` is the odd part. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variant39aef9ddee400b4157dc4c3b855dff556d19b0301cac0dd8ff2e8868a04b168a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Basic/Variant39aef9ddee400b4157dc4c3b855dff556d19b0301cac0dd8ff2e8868a04b168a.lean#L334).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f76683c5ca2e6fa7651186e158a5ce2c7080c64a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
