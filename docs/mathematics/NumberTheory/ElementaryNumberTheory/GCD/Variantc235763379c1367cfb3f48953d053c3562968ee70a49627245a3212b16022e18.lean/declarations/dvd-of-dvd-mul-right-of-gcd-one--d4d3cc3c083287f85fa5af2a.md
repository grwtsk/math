## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eea340af-d258-62f2-29a6-6681b0964e56`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 432–439.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dvd_of_dvd_mul_right_of_gcd_one {a b c : ℤ} (habc : a ∣ b * c) (hab : gcd a b = 1) :
    a ∣ c := by
  rw [mul_comm] at habc
  exact dvd_of_dvd_mul_left_of_gcd_one habc hab
#align int.dvd_of_dvd_mul_right_of_gcd_one Int.dvd_of_dvd_mul_right_of_gcd_one

/-- For nonzero integers `a` and `b`, `gcd a b` is the smallest positive natural number that can be
written in the form `a * x + b * y` for some pair of integers `x` and `y` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/GCD/Variantc235763379c1367cfb3f48953d053c3562968ee70a49627245a3212b16022e18.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/GCD/Variantc235763379c1367cfb3f48953d053c3562968ee70a49627245a3212b16022e18.lean#L432).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3c7494905d6e18db54c4226491e8f402297ece2e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
