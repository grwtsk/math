## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7e1b7ed6-f692-2c81-7c70-6fafb4ae7853`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 341–352.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Coprime.coprime_div_left (cmn : Coprime m n) (dvd : a ∣ m) : Coprime (m / a) n := by
  match eq_zero_or_pos a with
  | .inl h0 =>
    rw [h0] at dvd
    rw [Nat.eq_zero_of_zero_dvd dvd] at cmn ⊢
    simp; assumption
  | .inr hpos =>
    let ⟨k, hk⟩ := dvd
    rw [hk, Nat.mul_div_cancel_left _ hpos]
    rw [hk] at cmn
    exact cmn.coprime_mul_left

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/GCD/Variantefba33c05333f7105a091840820c3142f4639d0c5e60af139f26ed826face22f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Gcd/Variantefba33c05333f7105a091840820c3142f4639d0c5e60af139f26ed826face22f.lean#L341).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `13efaa95a5b4298bf048e76cc7f610bdab319ba4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
