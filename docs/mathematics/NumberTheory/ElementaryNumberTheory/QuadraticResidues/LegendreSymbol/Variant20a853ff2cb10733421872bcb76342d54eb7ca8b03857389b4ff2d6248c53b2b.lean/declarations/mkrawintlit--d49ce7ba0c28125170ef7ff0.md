## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:13c415f3bc6b437c58be5501cb3995a296b8af6ccee4baa18dffae318f3b08e0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 212–217.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def mkRawIntLit' (n : ℤ) : Q(ℤ) :=
  let lit : Q(ℕ) := .lit <| .natVal n.natAbs
  if 0 ≤ n then q(.ofNat $lit) else q(.negOfNat $lit)

/-- This evaluates `r := jacobiSymNat a b` recursively using quadratic reciprocity
and produces a proof term for the equality, assuming that `a < b` and `b` is odd. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/QuadraticResidues/LegendreSymbol/Variant20a853ff2cb10733421872bcb76342d54eb7ca8b03857389b4ff2d6248c53b2b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/LegendreSymbol/Variant20a853ff2cb10733421872bcb76342d54eb7ca8b03857389b4ff2d6248c53b2b.lean#L212).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1f6074dc1143b2b3168bc55b2c3682cd701939fc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
