## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:256a7527-d488-3967-8f81-56aecadaab7c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 161–168.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mul_left (a₁ a₂ : ℤ) (b : ℕ) : J(a₁ * a₂ | b) = J(a₁ | b) * J(a₂ | b) := by
  simp_rw [jacobiSym, List.pmap_eq_map_attach, legendreSym.mul _ _ _];
  exact List.prod_map_mul (α := ℤ) (l := (factors b).attach)
    (f := fun x ↦ @legendreSym x {out := prime_of_mem_factors x.2} a₁)
    (g := fun x ↦ @legendreSym x {out := prime_of_mem_factors x.2} a₂)
#align jacobi_sym.mul_left jacobiSym.mul_left

/-- The symbol `J(a | b)` vanishes iff `a` and `b` are not coprime (assuming `b ≠ 0`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/QuadraticResidues/JacobiSymbol/Variant2b0384e2e49420cf9d8dec8a21d90fe473633708eff0e2b1e0d24b17d319be51.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/JacobiSymbol/Variant2b0384e2e49420cf9d8dec8a21d90fe473633708eff0e2b1e0d24b17d319be51.lean#L161).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f1f830ec89cc5982a95f8e9f5ab1cf994e621908` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
