## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ebea5f49-5873-0c9f-dc2c-01156d9dc4fd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 56–66.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cast_nnratCast {K} [DivisionRing K] (q : ℚ≥0) :
    ((q : ℚ) : K) = (q : K) := by
  rw [Rat.cast_def, NNRat.cast_def, NNRat.cast_def]
  have hn := @num_div_eq_of_coprime q.num q.den ?hdp q.coprime_num_den
  on_goal 1 => have hd := @den_div_eq_of_coprime q.num q.den ?hdp q.coprime_num_den
  case hdp => simpa only [Int.natCast_pos] using q.den_pos
  simp only [Int.cast_natCast, Nat.cast_inj] at hn hd
  rw [hn, hd, Int.cast_natCast]

/-- Casting a scientific literal via `ℚ` is the same as casting directly. -/
@[simp, norm_cast]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Lemmas/Variant876b115bca1a1279f74ae9146f00bc22f920d614665c8bb4d14e547d40994ecc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Lemmas/Variant876b115bca1a1279f74ae9146f00bc22f920d614665c8bb4d14e547d40994ecc.lean#L56).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `525c749c3d673146ce7df5cce65d445d1dc48e2b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
