## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a627b48ae33e64c0bbeccfdb7dd74befc31bb5317612007e5f5e8e52b6127292`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 288–294.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

noncomputable def finiteCrtEncode {Index : Type*} [Fintype Index]

    (coprime : Pairwise (Function.onFun Nat.Coprime radix))
    (coordinates : (i : Index) → ZMod (radix i)) : ZMod (∏ i, radix i) :=

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/PrimeBoundedContinuation/Varianta922c67e3e4ba26127aeeea81af189f49af8f7ce8494d24ec37abd9689e34b3f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/PrimeBoundedContinuation/Varianta922c67e3e4ba26127aeeea81af189f49af8f7ce8494d24ec37abd9689e34b3f.lean#L288).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `928984746240acd6f1ed0536abf2316d553344ee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
