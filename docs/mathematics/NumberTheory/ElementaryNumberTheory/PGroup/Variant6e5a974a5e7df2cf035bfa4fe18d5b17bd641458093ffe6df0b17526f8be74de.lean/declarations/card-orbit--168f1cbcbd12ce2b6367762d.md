## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4566a6c9-4efe-d961-573a-5b94b83e07ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 151–161.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem card_orbit (a : α) [Finite (orbit G a)] : ∃ n : ℕ, Nat.card (orbit G a) = p ^ n := by
  let ϕ := orbitEquivQuotientStabilizer G a
  haveI := Finite.of_equiv (orbit G a) ϕ
  haveI := (stabilizer G a).finiteIndex_of_finite_quotient
  rw [Nat.card_congr ϕ]
  exact hG.index (stabilizer G a)

variable (α) [Finite α]

/-- If `G` is a `p`-group acting on a finite set `α`, then the number of fixed points
  of the action is congruent mod `p` to the cardinality of `α` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/PGroup/Variant6e5a974a5e7df2cf035bfa4fe18d5b17bd641458093ffe6df0b17526f8be74de.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/PGroup/Variant6e5a974a5e7df2cf035bfa4fe18d5b17bd641458093ffe6df0b17526f8be74de.lean#L151).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fd3698d4f1049d776ffb2485c0a03a9ee8e17956` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
