## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5de33a01-3861-29dd-d975-ef70935bc26a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 332–338.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem chineseRemainder'_lt_lcm (h : a ≡ b [MOD gcd n m]) (hn : n ≠ 0) (hm : m ≠ 0) :
    ↑(chineseRemainder' h) < lcm n m := by
  dsimp only [chineseRemainder']
  rw [dif_neg hn, dif_neg hm, Subtype.coe_mk, xgcd_val, ← Int.toNat_natCast (lcm n m)]
  have lcm_pos := Int.natCast_pos.mpr (Nat.pos_of_ne_zero (lcm_ne_zero hn hm))
  exact (Int.toNat_lt_toNat lcm_pos).mpr (Int.emod_lt_of_pos _ lcm_pos)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ModEq/Variant456da603f2c807512e5ceb4f66400d7e5a540cb95e095143c35809b7ea5a4559.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/ModEq/Variant456da603f2c807512e5ceb4f66400d7e5a540cb95e095143c35809b7ea5a4559.lean#L332).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e2eeca0e81620eec3c350508c2c1d4187eb28cad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
