## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:344339b76b9f8ac9cf4fb303fec703e03af43c776d228b09d2c15167f4399424`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 306–316.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def factorizationEquiv : ℕ+ ≃ { f : ℕ →₀ ℕ // ∀ p ∈ f.support, Prime p } where
  toFun := fun ⟨n, _⟩ => ⟨n.factorization, fun _ => prime_of_mem_primeFactors⟩
  invFun := fun ⟨f, hf⟩ =>
    ⟨f.prod _, prod_pow_pos_of_zero_notMem_support fun H => not_prime_zero (hf 0 H)⟩
  left_inv := fun ⟨_, hx⟩ => Subtype.ext <| prod_factorization_pow_eq_self hx.ne.symm
  right_inv := fun ⟨_, hf⟩ => Subtype.ext <| prod_pow_factorization_eq_self hf

/-! ### Factorization and coprimes -/


/-- For coprime `a` and `b`, the power of `p` in `a * b` is the sum of the powers in `a` and `b` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Defs/Variant64260dd7e04f7fc89d064485069c1e113caa1aa7fd7ab504628056772bc7f93b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Defs/Variant64260dd7e04f7fc89d064485069c1e113caa1aa7fd7ab504628056772bc7f93b.lean#L306).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `083e01712b4ff4005135b80928b7b11e5245b218` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
