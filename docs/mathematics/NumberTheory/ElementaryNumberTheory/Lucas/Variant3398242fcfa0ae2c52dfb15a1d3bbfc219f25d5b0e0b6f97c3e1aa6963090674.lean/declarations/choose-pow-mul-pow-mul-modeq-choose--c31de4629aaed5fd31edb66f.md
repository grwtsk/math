## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0632698f-c2ea-723f-cd2c-c9ac740e034d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–128.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem choose_pow_mul_pow_mul_modEq_choose :
    choose (p ^ k * a) (p ^ k * b) ≡ choose a b [ZMOD p] := by
  induction k with
  | zero => simp [Int.ModEq.refl]
  | succ k ih =>
    grw [Nat.pow_succ', mul_assoc, mul_assoc, choose_mul_mul_modEq_choose, ih]

/-- For primes `p`, `choose (p ^ k * a) (p ^ k * b)` is congruent to `choose a b` modulo `p`.
Also see `choose_pow_mul_pow_mul_modEq_choose` for the version with `ZMOD`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Lucas/Variant3398242fcfa0ae2c52dfb15a1d3bbfc219f25d5b0e0b6f97c3e1aa6963090674.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ElementaryNumberTheory/Lucas/Variant3398242fcfa0ae2c52dfb15a1d3bbfc219f25d5b0e0b6f97c3e1aa6963090674.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `31bd1f8d0f7f96128a4942ec32890ae7c8adf169` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
