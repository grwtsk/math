## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7f23b2b8-1dda-6272-d206-d528b8485d3b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 50–58.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem gateBit_eq_fourier (p : ℕ) [NeZero p] (n : ℕ) :
    (gateBit p n : ℂ) = 1 - fourierDelta p n + if n = p then 1 else 0 := by
  rw [fourierDelta_eq]
  by_cases he : n = p
  · subst n
    simp [gateBit, Gate]
  · by_cases hd : p ∣ n <;> simp [gateBit, Gate, he, hd]

/-- The finite set of all prime moduli needed for labels through N. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ModularBoundary/Variantc8cc5b57bd7d2e1753528d9ffb06331dc8000f536450133aac5cff9aa821dd76.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ModularBoundary/Variantc8cc5b57bd7d2e1753528d9ffb06331dc8000f536450133aac5cff9aa821dd76.lean#L50).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5b02bca29c6d7ab70311dfda5a71ebf70789c394` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
