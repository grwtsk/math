## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4b066d4f-ec73-116c-cea2-a5df70687a8b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 31–39.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem norm_head_sub_log_evaluated_le (x h T : ℝ) (hh : 0 < h) (ha : 1 < x - h)
    (inputs : ∀ z : ↥(heightHead T), PointInput x h z.1.1) :
    ‖(∑ z ∈ heightHead T, (multiplicity z : ℂ) * tentKernel x h z.1) -
      evaluatedHead x h T (fun z => (inputs z).toPointEvaluation)‖ ≤
      headError x h T (fun z => (inputs z).toPointEvaluation) :=
  norm_head_sub_evaluated_le x h T hh ha (fun z => (inputs z).toPointEvaluation)

/-- Whole-head evaluation and each endpoint log bound are now supplied internally.
Actual coordinate enclosure, exact membership and strict margin remain. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Chebyshev/CanonicalTentLogEvaluation.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Chebyshev/CanonicalTentLogEvaluation.lean#L31).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `55bf2a7d8ab14aae02ba369e2114ea89a08d1882` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
