## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9704b8a7-4e53-4baf-b257-c3f629cc605e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 171–191.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_mem_range : ∃ n : ℕ, n < p ∧ x - n ∈ maximalIdeal ℤ_[p] := by
  simp only [maximalIdeal_eq_span_p, Ideal.mem_span_singleton, ← norm_lt_one_iff_dvd]
  obtain ⟨r, hr⟩ := rat_dense p (x : ℚ_[p]) zero_lt_one
  have H : ‖(r : ℚ_[p])‖ ≤ 1 := by
    rw [norm_sub_rev] at hr
    calc
      _ = ‖(r : ℚ_[p]) - x + x‖ := by ring_nf
      _ ≤ _ := padicNormE.nonarchimedean _ _
      _ ≤ _ := max_le (le_of_lt hr) x.2

  obtain ⟨n, hzn, hnp, hn⟩ := exists_mem_range_of_norm_rat_le_one r H
  lift n to ℕ using hzn
  use n
  constructor
  · exact mod_cast hnp
  simp only [norm_def, coe_sub, Subtype.coe_mk, coe_natCast] at hn ⊢
  rw [show (x - n : ℚ_[p]) = x - r + (r - n) by ring]
  apply lt_of_le_of_lt (padicNormE.nonarchimedean _ _)
  apply max_lt hr
  simpa using hn

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/RingHoms/Variant2c05b4f4231d06ddb38fd1c369b78cdef7c04be919f8aaef39442e9a52fbce31.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/RingHoms/Variant2c05b4f4231d06ddb38fd1c369b78cdef7c04be919f8aaef39442e9a52fbce31.lean#L171).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3d6e63e6774a1826ab35c35833354a3029a48d17` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
