## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:866a5e13ba83f4af74cd893b4e5c72212b750fca700f842a78388cb38a54ba6b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 327–335.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : MulAction (torsion K) (integerSet K) where
  one_smul := fun _ ↦ by
    rw [Subtype.mk_eq_mk, integerSetTorsionSMul_smul_coe, OneMemClass.coe_one, one_smul]
  mul_smul := fun _ _ _ ↦ by
    rw [Subtype.mk_eq_mk]
    simp_rw [integerSetTorsionSMul_smul_coe, Subgroup.coe_mul, mul_smul]

/-- The `mixedEmbedding.norm` of `a : integerSet K` as a natural number, see also
`intNorm_coe`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/FundamentalCone/Variantdd15e1a55c7215348c10f69d2af7265b3875e2ff2513a920e1ddc42f8ed71655.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/FundamentalCone/Variantdd15e1a55c7215348c10f69d2af7265b3875e2ff2513a920e1ddc42f8ed71655.lean#L327).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c73dc1f4511bc61f0b68dac5fd12e97f4aa19c0e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
