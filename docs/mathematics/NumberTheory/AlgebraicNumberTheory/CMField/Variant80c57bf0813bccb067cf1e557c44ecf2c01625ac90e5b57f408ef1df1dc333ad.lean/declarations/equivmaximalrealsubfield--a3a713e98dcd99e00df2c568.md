## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5ccb0e33ad298071c1134268a98a2f04f1b4d18373080107e1bd3947fb0dacd0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 488–498.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def equivMaximalRealSubfield :
    F ≃+* maximalRealSubfield K :=
  (algebraMap F K).rangeRestrictFieldEquiv.trans (RingEquiv.subfieldCongr (by
    have := IsTotallyReal.ofRingEquiv (algebraMap F K).rangeRestrictFieldEquiv
    have : IsQuadraticExtension (algebraMap F K).fieldRange K :=
    { finrank_eq_two' :=
        (IsQuadraticExtension.finrank_eq_two F K) ▸ Algebra.finrank_eq_of_equiv_equiv
          (algebraMap F K).rangeRestrictFieldEquiv.symm (RingEquiv.refl K) (by ext; simp; rfl) }
    exact eq_maximalRealSubfield K (algebraMap F K).fieldRange))

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/CMField/Variant80c57bf0813bccb067cf1e557c44ecf2c01625ac90e5b57f408ef1df1dc333ad.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/CMField/Variant80c57bf0813bccb067cf1e557c44ecf2c01625ac90e5b57f408ef1df1dc333ad.lean#L488).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `21130fd5375f3d6de45c8e317078dde18a9d0bb7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
