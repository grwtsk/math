## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d2e4868d-3ce7-17c8-bc0c-ee20d9c65cdf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1088–1096.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem volume_negAt_plusPart (hm : MeasurableSet A) :
    volume (negAt s '' (plusPart A)) = volume (plusPart A) := by
  rw [← negAt_symm, ContinuousLinearEquiv.image_symm_eq_preimage,
    volume_preserving_negAt.measure_preimage (measurableSet_plusPart hm).nullMeasurableSet]

include hA in
open scoped Classical in
/-- If a subset `A` of the `mixedSpace` is symmetric at real places, then its volume is
`2^ nrRealPlaces K` times the volume of its `plusPart`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/Basic/Varianteb8a669b3a1c8ef1b2436101da9ce1ba8d751ce50f4d8b39c7b1f13841a83536.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/Basic/Varianteb8a669b3a1c8ef1b2436101da9ce1ba8d751ce50f4d8b39c7b1f13841a83536.lean#L1088).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `82a4cd2cca4d1719930333affd8822ea9a3db609` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
