## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:734edd8b-f5c9-affe-547c-dfb8aab628d1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 522–529.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem fundamentalDomain_stdBasis :
    fundamentalDomain (stdBasis K) =
      (Set.univ.pi fun _ => Set.Ico 0 1) ×ˢ
      (Set.univ.pi fun _ => Complex.measurableEquivPi ⁻¹' (Set.univ.pi fun _ => Set.Ico 0 1)) := by
  ext
  simp [stdBasis, mem_fundamentalDomain, Complex.measurableEquivPi]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/Basic/Varianteb8a669b3a1c8ef1b2436101da9ce1ba8d751ce50f4d8b39c7b1f13841a83536.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/Basic/Varianteb8a669b3a1c8ef1b2436101da9ce1ba8d751ce50f4d8b39c7b1f13841a83536.lean#L522).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `82a4cd2cca4d1719930333affd8822ea9a3db609` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
