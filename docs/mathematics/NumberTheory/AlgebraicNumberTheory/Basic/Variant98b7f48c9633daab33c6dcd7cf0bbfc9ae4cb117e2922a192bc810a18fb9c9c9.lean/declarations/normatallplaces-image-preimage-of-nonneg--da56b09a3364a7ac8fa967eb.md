## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1e773207-970c-36ec-2ec5-6fde022b4851`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1262–1272.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem normAtAllPlaces_image_preimage_of_nonneg {s : Set (realSpace K)}
    (hs : ∀ x ∈ s, ∀ w, 0 ≤ x w) :
    normAtAllPlaces '' (normAtAllPlaces ⁻¹' s) = s := by
  rw [Set.image_preimage_eq_iff]
  rintro x hx
  refine ⟨mixedSpaceOfRealSpace x, funext fun w ↦ ?_⟩
  rw [normAtAllPlaces_apply, normAtPlace_mixedSpaceOfRealSpace (hs x hx w)]

end realSpace

end NumberField.mixedEmbedding
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/Basic/Variant98b7f48c9633daab33c6dcd7cf0bbfc9ae4cb117e2922a192bc810a18fb9c9c9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/Basic/Variant98b7f48c9633daab33c6dcd7cf0bbfc9ae4cb117e2922a192bc810a18fb9c9c9.lean#L1262).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4c813c5689dc9b979161222249d0a01268774891` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
