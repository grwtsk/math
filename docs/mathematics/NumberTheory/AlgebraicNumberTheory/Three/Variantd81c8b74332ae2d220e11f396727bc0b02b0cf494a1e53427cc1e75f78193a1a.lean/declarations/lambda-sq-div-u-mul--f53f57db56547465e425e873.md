## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:31bd63b1-7b44-c762-4e25-3b260e70e5f9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 661–667.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private lemma lambda_sq_div_u₅_mul : λ ^ 2 ∣ S.u₅ * (λ ^ (S.multiplicity - 1) * S.X) ^ 3 := by
  use λ^(3*S.multiplicity-5)*S.u₅*(S.X^3)
  have : 3*(S.multiplicity-1) = 2+(3*S.multiplicity-5) := by have := S.two_le_multiplicity; omega
  calc _ = λ^(3*(S.multiplicity-1))*S.u₅*S.X^3 := by ring
  _ = λ^2*λ^(3*S.multiplicity-5)*S.u₅*S.X^3 := by rw [this, pow_add]
  _ = λ^2*(λ^(3*S.multiplicity-5)*S.u₅*S.X^3) := by ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/Three/Variantd81c8b74332ae2d220e11f396727bc0b02b0cf494a1e53427cc1e75f78193a1a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/Three/Variantd81c8b74332ae2d220e11f396727bc0b02b0cf494a1e53427cc1e75f78193a1a.lean#L661).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `86eac8ca69a001fbbafadc15da5546a575c62124` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
