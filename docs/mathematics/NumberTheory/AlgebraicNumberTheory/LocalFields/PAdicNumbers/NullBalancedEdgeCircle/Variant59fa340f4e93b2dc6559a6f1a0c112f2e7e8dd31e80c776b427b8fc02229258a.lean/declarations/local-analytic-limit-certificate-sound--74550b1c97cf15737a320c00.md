## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:02f782d4-712d-5f55-3155-9681b468c3c6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 212–225.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem local_analytic_limit_certificate_sound
    {D : DirectionSystem.{u, v}}
    (L : LocalAnalyticLimitCertificate.{u, v, w} D) :
    L.limitExists ∧ L.edgeRelaxationConverges :=
  ⟨L.limitProof, L.edgeRelaxationConvergesProof⟩

/-! ## B5. δ-ring / prismatic realization -/

/--
A proof-carrying δ-ring / prismatic realization of directional chains,
wrapping the existing `PrismaticSiteAuthority`. A δ-ring label alone does
not produce prismatic comparison; all prismatic content is carried by the
wrapped authority's proof fields.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/NullBalancedEdgeCircle/Variant59fa340f4e93b2dc6559a6f1a0c112f2e7e8dd31e80c776b427b8fc02229258a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/NullBalancedEdgeCircle/Variant59fa340f4e93b2dc6559a6f1a0c112f2e7e8dd31e80c776b427b8fc02229258a.lean#L212).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c1c5f3fced35f66b4b5f0f7630cde9a9ce18379e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
