## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2b9327fa-730a-2e30-a8e9-9adb98a03079`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 172–184.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem of_int (z : ℤ) : padicNorm p z ≤ 1 :=
  if hz : z = 0 then by simp [hz, zero_le_one]
  else by
    unfold padicNorm
    rw [if_neg _]
    · refine' zpow_le_one_of_nonpos _ _
      · exact_mod_cast le_of_lt hp.1.one_lt
      · rw [padicValRat.of_int, neg_nonpos]
        norm_cast
        simp
    exact_mod_cast hz
#align padic_norm.of_int padicNorm.of_int

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/PadicNorm/Variant19b93526681a5925867cd684fe357854dad2345750a4b3148223728466b61112.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/PadicNorm/Variant19b93526681a5925867cd684fe357854dad2345750a4b3148223728466b61112.lean#L172).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `661598ba2f70e41c2e4619639842ebe4eca766dc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
