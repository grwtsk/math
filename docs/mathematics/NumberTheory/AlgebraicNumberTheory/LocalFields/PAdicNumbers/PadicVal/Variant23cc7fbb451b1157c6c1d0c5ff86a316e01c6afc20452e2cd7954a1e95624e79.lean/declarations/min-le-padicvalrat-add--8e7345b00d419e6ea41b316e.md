## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7c73ad0c-2887-8f6f-4c99-eb759a51b9a4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 431–441.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem min_le_padicValRat_add {q r : ℚ} (hqr : q + r ≠ 0) :
    min (padicValRat p q) (padicValRat p r) ≤ padicValRat p (q + r) :=
  (le_total (padicValRat p q) (padicValRat p r)).elim
  (fun h => by rw [min_eq_left h]; exact le_padicValRat_add_of_le hqr h)
  (fun h => by rw [min_eq_right h, add_comm]; exact le_padicValRat_add_of_le (by rwa [add_comm]) h)
#align padic_val_rat.min_le_padic_val_rat_add padicValRat.min_le_padicValRat_add

open BigOperators

/-- A finite sum of rationals with positive `p`-adic valuation has positive `p`-adic valuation
(if the sum is non-zero). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/PadicVal/Variant23cc7fbb451b1157c6c1d0c5ff86a316e01c6afc20452e2cd7954a1e95624e79.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/PadicVal/Variant23cc7fbb451b1157c6c1d0c5ff86a316e01c6afc20452e2cd7954a1e95624e79.lean#L431).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `544f2915c5ba1c70d9a13de107b22ee5fa3eb755` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
