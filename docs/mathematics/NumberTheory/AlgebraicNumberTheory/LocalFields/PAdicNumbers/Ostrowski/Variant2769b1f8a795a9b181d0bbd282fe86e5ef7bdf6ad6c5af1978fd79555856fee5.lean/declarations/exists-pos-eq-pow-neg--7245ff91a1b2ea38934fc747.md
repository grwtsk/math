## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d7e7dc9d-5e67-d12a-23cf-4672189a1b9a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 221–230.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma exists_pos_eq_pow_neg : ∃ t : ℝ, 0 < t ∧ f p = p ^ (-t) := by
  have hp : (1 : ℝ) < p :=
    mod_cast (is_prime_of_minimal_nat_zero_lt_and_lt_one hp0 hp1 hmin).one_lt
  exact ⟨-logb p (f p), neg_pos.mpr <| logb_neg hp hp0 hp1, by
    simpa using (rpow_logb (zero_lt_one.trans hp) hp.ne' hp0).symm⟩

/-- If `f` is bounded and not trivial, then it is equivalent to a p-adic absolute value. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/Ostrowski/Variant2769b1f8a795a9b181d0bbd282fe86e5ef7bdf6ad6c5af1978fd79555856fee5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/Ostrowski/Variant2769b1f8a795a9b181d0bbd282fe86e5ef7bdf6ad6c5af1978fd79555856fee5.lean#L221).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f3edb13cdff78abe1e73b357aee38e8342727f14` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
