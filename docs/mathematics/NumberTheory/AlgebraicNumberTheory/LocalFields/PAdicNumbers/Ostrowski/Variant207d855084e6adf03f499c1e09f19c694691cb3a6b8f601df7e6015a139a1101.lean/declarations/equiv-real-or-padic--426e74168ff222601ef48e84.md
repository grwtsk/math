## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b2f9c381-1a98-e940-7dbc-910826fd8642`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 472–478.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem equiv_real_or_padic (f : AbsoluteValue ℚ ℝ) (hf_nontriv : f.IsNontrivial) :
    f ≈ real ∨ ∃! p, ∃ (_ : Fact p.Prime), f ≈ (padic p) := by
  by_cases bdd : ∀ n : ℕ, f n ≤ 1
  · exact .inr <| equiv_padic_of_bounded hf_nontriv bdd
  · exact .inl <| equiv_real_of_unbounded bdd

/-- The standard absolute value on `ℚ` is not equivalent to any `p`-adic absolute value. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/Ostrowski/Variant207d855084e6adf03f499c1e09f19c694691cb3a6b8f601df7e6015a139a1101.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/Ostrowski/Variant207d855084e6adf03f499c1e09f19c694691cb3a6b8f601df7e6015a139a1101.lean#L472).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c18726a88fe184f7279ea707649f1a95d805690` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
