## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4d656ae2173fe7d0efe37a5c862f0d5fda7b1443c913224bc0929067260acdc8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 601–624.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

def padicNormE {p : ℕ} [hp : Fact p.Prime] : AbsoluteValue ℚ_[p] ℚ where
  toFun := Quotient.lift PadicSeq.norm <| @PadicSeq.norm_equiv _ _
  map_mul' q r := Quotient.inductionOn₂ q r <| PadicSeq.norm_mul

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/PadicNumbers/Variantb1237adcd8fc43068f354b4b3d946b6c01d0fb258abefe8157bd8ad3aef5a0f4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/PadicNumbers/Variantb1237adcd8fc43068f354b4b3d946b6c01d0fb258abefe8157bd8ad3aef5a0f4.lean#L601).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `79040472922216be2c0d66793e3b2a3965347e9c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
