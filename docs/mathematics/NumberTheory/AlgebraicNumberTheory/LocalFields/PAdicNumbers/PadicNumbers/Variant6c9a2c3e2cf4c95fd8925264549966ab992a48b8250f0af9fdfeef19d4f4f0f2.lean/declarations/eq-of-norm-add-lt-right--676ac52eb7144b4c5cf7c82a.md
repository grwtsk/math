## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b7bc31b3-8ea4-e3df-ca8d-b882138d436a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 876–879.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_of_norm_add_lt_right {z1 z2 : ℚ_[p]} (h : ‖z1 + z2‖ < ‖z2‖) : ‖z1‖ = ‖z2‖ :=
  _root_.by_contradiction fun hne ↦
    not_lt_of_ge (by rw [padicNormE.add_eq_max_of_ne hne]; apply le_max_right) h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/PadicNumbers/Variant6c9a2c3e2cf4c95fd8925264549966ab992a48b8250f0af9fdfeef19d4f4f0f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/PadicNumbers/Variant6c9a2c3e2cf4c95fd8925264549966ab992a48b8250f0af9fdfeef19d4f4f0f2.lean#L876).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bc762418499a1532c1be504ff419be8e8d132d83` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
