## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4b67d68c-a82c-0b7e-7caa-422dddfe1407`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 187–206.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem stationary {f : CauSeq ℚ (padicNorm p)} (hf : ¬f ≈ 0) :
    ∃ N, ∀ m n, N ≤ m → N ≤ n → padicNorm p (f n) = padicNorm p (f m) :=
  have : ∃ ε > 0, ∃ N1, ∀ j ≥ N1, ε ≤ padicNorm p (f j) :=
    CauSeq.abv_pos_of_not_limZero <| not_limZero_of_not_congr_zero hf
  let ⟨ε, hε, N1, hN1⟩ := this
  let ⟨N2, hN2⟩ := CauSeq.cauchy₂ f hε

    have : padicNorm p (f n - f m) < ε := hN2 _ (max_le_iff.1 hn).2 _ (max_le_iff.1 hm).2
    have : padicNorm p (f n - f m) < padicNorm p (f n) :=
      lt_of_lt_of_le this <| hN1 _ (max_le_iff.1 hn).1
    have : padicNorm p (f n - f m) < max (padicNorm p (f n)) (padicNorm p (f m)) :=

/-- For all `n ≥ stationaryPoint f hf`, the `p`-adic norm of `f n` is the same. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/PadicNumbers/Variant91a8dee2c66e6081f4fdc0af44233e118c67dce041a513d5b79f1650ef7713b1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/PadicNumbers/Variant91a8dee2c66e6081f4fdc0af44233e118c67dce041a513d5b79f1650ef7713b1.lean#L187).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a086f67d63d1db413964d538a37349956f65b76` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
