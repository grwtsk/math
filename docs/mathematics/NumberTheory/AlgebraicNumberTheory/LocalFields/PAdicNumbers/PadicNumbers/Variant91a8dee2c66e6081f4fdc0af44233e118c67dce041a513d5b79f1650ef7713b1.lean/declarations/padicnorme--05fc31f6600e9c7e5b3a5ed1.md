## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:43efb65a3b92726aa3267835d13bca89088bd40fa184200c388014db1520c34d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 609–632.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def padicNormE {p : ℕ} [hp : Fact p.Prime] : AbsoluteValue ℚ_[p] ℚ where
  toFun := Quotient.lift PadicSeq.norm <| @PadicSeq.norm_equiv _ _
  map_mul' q r := Quotient.inductionOn₂ q r <| PadicSeq.norm_mul
  nonneg' q := Quotient.inductionOn q <| PadicSeq.norm_nonneg
  eq_zero' q := Quotient.inductionOn q fun r ↦ by
    rw [Padic.zero_def, Quotient.lift_mk, PadicSeq.norm_zero_iff r]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/PadicNumbers/Variant91a8dee2c66e6081f4fdc0af44233e118c67dce041a513d5b79f1650ef7713b1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/PadicNumbers/Variant91a8dee2c66e6081f4fdc0af44233e118c67dce041a513d5b79f1650ef7713b1.lean#L609).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a086f67d63d1db413964d538a37349956f65b76` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
