## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:16bcab79-f37c-5b76-8363-437cfd54dd93`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 333–354.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem norm_eq_of_equiv_aux {f g : PadicSeq p} (hf : ¬f ≈ 0) (hg : ¬g ≈ 0) (hfg : f ≈ g)
    (h : padicNorm p (f (stationaryPoint hf)) ≠ padicNorm p (g (stationaryPoint hg)))
    (hlt : padicNorm p (g (stationaryPoint hg)) < padicNorm p (f (stationaryPoint hf))) :
    False := by
  have hpn : 0 < padicNorm p (f (stationaryPoint hf)) - padicNorm p (g (stationaryPoint hg)) :=
    sub_pos_of_lt hlt
  cases' hfg _ hpn with N hN
  let i := max N (max (stationaryPoint hf) (stationaryPoint hg))
  have hi : N ≤ i := le_max_left _ _
  have hN' := hN _ hi
  -- Porting note: originally `padic_index_simp [N, hf, hg] at hN' h hlt`
  rw [lift_index_left hf N (stationaryPoint hg), lift_index_right hg N (stationaryPoint hf)]
    at hN' h hlt
  have hpne : padicNorm p (f i) ≠ padicNorm p (-g i) := by rwa [← padicNorm.neg (g i)] at h
  rw [CauSeq.sub_apply, sub_eq_add_neg, add_eq_max_of_ne hpne, padicNorm.neg, max_eq_left_of_lt hlt]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/PadicNumbers/Variant4aad69b2185ec5c5dfcf317cd673cb636ff838f8f7ece23af2a937d8ee50ecf8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AlgebraicNumberTheory/LocalFields/PAdicNumbers/PadicNumbers/Variant4aad69b2185ec5c5dfcf317cd673cb636ff838f8f7ece23af2a937d8ee50ecf8.lean#L333).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `03992962c56bade9f45eae6542bea6aa3fcdf176` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
