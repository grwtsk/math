## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5c14625b7a47648788b91fc3ad406a729b2f8492e845d1f11f7c5250c5b0a8b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 117–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure StageBijectionSound (S : QuotientBridgeStage) : Prop where
  finite_stage_injective : S.Valid
  finite_stage_surjective : S.Valid
  trace_bridge_sound : S.Valid

/--
Finite-stage quotient bijection.

The statement targets the quotient map `B_n / ~_n -> T_n`, not raw
bitstream equality and not compact-shell identity.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/RiemannSchedulerChebyshev/Variant769e57b3fc5385ffa5638a08ed90f6b8de62d401fc2ec5ba14b9f3390ac5d579.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/RiemannSchedulerChebyshev/Variant769e57b3fc5385ffa5638a08ed90f6b8de62d401fc2ec5ba14b9f3390ac5d579.lean#L117).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b79e62661e927d66b5d389011fb3436cc4c3600b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
