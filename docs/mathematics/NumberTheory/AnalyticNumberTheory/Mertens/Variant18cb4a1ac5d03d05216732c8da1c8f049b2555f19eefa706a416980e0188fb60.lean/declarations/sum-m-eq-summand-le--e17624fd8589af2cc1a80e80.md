## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:842a45a6-24e8-4758-0768-0f3f631f3c5a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1453–1473.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

$$ E_3(x) = O\left(\frac{1}{\log x}\right) $$

$$\sum_{p \le x}(\log (1-1/p)+1/p) = (M - \gamma) + O(1/x).$$
The result follows by combining with \ref{Mertens-second-error-prime-abs-le}.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Mertens/Variant18cb4a1ac5d03d05216732c8da1c8f049b2555f19eefa706a416980e0188fb60.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Mertens/Variant18cb4a1ac5d03d05216732c8da1c8f049b2555f19eefa706a416980e0188fb60.lean#L1453).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f971697d72fc8ce2f92ecabd68e04bdd83d36a1c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
