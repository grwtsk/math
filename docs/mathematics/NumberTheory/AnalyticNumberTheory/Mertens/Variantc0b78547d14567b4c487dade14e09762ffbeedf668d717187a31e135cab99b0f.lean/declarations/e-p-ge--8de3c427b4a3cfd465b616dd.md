## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:76d62c43-0d4f-bbe5-4b03-a1d4dff781f2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 559–572.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem E₁p.ge {x : ℝ} (hx : 1 ≤ x) :
    E₁p x ≥ -2 - E₁ := by
    linarith [E₁Λ.le_E₁p_add_E₁ hx, E₁Λ.ge hx]


@[blueprint
  "Mertens-first-theorem-prime-bounded"
  (title := "Error term in Mertens' first theorem bounded (prime form)")
  (statement := /-- For any $x \geq 1$, one has
$$ \sum_{p \leq x} \frac{\log p}{p} = \log x + O(1). $$
-/)
  (proof := /-- Immediate from previous two corollaries.
  -/)
  (discussion := 1313)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Mertens/Variantc0b78547d14567b4c487dade14e09762ffbeedf668d717187a31e135cab99b0f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Mertens/Variantc0b78547d14567b4c487dade14e09762ffbeedf668d717187a31e135cab99b0f.lean#L559).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `54ba4bc8c79067a36f0e8e981b9aaa0dc8cdda6c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
