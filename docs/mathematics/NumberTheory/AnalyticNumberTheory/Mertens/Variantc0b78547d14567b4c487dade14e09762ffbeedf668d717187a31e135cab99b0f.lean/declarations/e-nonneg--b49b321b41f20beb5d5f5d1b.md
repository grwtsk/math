## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:58d90e0a-eb82-fb46-8239-d8471a5e859c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 499–515.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem E₁.nonneg : E₁ ≥ 0 :=
  tsum_nonneg E₁.summand_nonneg

@[blueprint
  "Mertens-first-error-prime-ge"
  (title := "Partial sum of $\\frac{\\log p}{p}$ lower bound")
  (statement := /-- For any $x \geq 1$, one has
$$ E_{1,\Lambda}(x) \leq E_{1,p}(x) + E_1$$
and thus
$$ E_{1,p}(x) \geq -2 - E_1$$
where
$$ E_1 := \sum_{p} \frac{\log p}{p(p-1)}. $$
-/)
  (proof := /-- Use the triangle inequality and the geometric series formula to estimate in Lemma \ref{Mertens-sum-mangoldt-div-le} arising from prime powers.
  -/)
  (latexEnv := "corollary")
  (discussion := 1312)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Mertens/Variantc0b78547d14567b4c487dade14e09762ffbeedf668d717187a31e135cab99b0f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Mertens/Variantc0b78547d14567b4c487dade14e09762ffbeedf668d717187a31e135cab99b0f.lean#L499).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `54ba4bc8c79067a36f0e8e981b9aaa0dc8cdda6c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
