## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6786c7e0-8480-c3f0-5f39-db92317bf1b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 180–187.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma cardFactors_of_mem_divisorsAntidiagonal {n : ℕ} {x : ℕ × ℕ}
    (hx : x ∈ n.divisorsAntidiagonal) : Ω n = Ω x.1 + Ω x.2 := by
  obtain ⟨hprod, hn⟩ := Nat.mem_divisorsAntidiagonal.mp hx
  have h1 : x.1 ≠ 0 := by rintro h; simp [h] at hprod; exact hn hprod.symm
  have h2 : x.2 ≠ 0 := by rintro h; simp [h] at hprod; exact hn hprod.symm
  rw [← hprod, ArithmeticFunction.cardFactors_mul h1 h2]

/-- Λ^{∗m}(n) = 0 unless Ω(n) ≥ m  (each Λ-factor uses up one prime factor counted with multiplicity). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Basic/Variantb673b2a806a4d1dbb3329053bf0883edc2d2db59f5b7f05aa73b150f12e84c64.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Basic/Variantb673b2a806a4d1dbb3329053bf0883edc2d2db59f5b7f05aa73b150f12e84c64.lean#L180).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `98391cd54219a20fa3b9d5949141d7ecef5de3d2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
