## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5e86b512-18a8-ade3-a81d-191670f1cb2d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 258–264.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mertensResidual_eq_defect_trend_nonaffine (A : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    mertensResidual A = -1 + continuousDefect A + trendValue A + nonaffineWork A := by
  rw [mertensResidual_eq_affine_nonaffine A hA, one_add_continuous_eq_defect A hA]



/-- Actual negative half of the weighted first correlation moment. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/SourceKapitzaReconstruction/Variant6ac8d6155a205143b1836b5798e305f3888e231483d79f3f5724bb4ea5a4072e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/SourceKapitzaReconstruction/Variant6ac8d6155a205143b1836b5798e305f3888e231483d79f3f5724bb4ea5a4072e.lean#L258).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c99fdc0e1608430691533c02d5e9599eb4e43d54` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
