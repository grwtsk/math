## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:602fee8b-6ccc-93ba-d883-b4be10491e1b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 213–227.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private lemma theta_err_simpl {x : ℝ} (hx : x ≥ exp 22) :
    4.2065e-1 * x / (log x) ^ 3 ≤ 0.0009 * x / log x := by
  have hlog_pos : (0 : ℝ) < log x := by linarith [log_ge_22 hx]
  have hxlog : 0 ≤ x / log x :=
    div_nonneg (le_of_lt (lt_of_lt_of_le (exp_pos _) hx)) hlog_pos.le
  have hlog_sq : (22 : ℝ) ^ 2 ≤ (log x) ^ 2 :=
    pow_le_pow_left₀ (by norm_num) (log_ge_22 hx) 2
  have hcoeff : (4.2065e-1 : ℝ) / (log x) ^ 2 ≤ 0.0009 := by
    rw [div_le_iff₀ (pow_pos hlog_pos 2)]
    nlinarith
  calc 4.2065e-1 * x / (log x) ^ 3
      = (4.2065e-1 / (log x) ^ 2) * (x / log x) := by ring
    _ ≤ 0.0009 * (x / log x) := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right hcoeff hxlog
    _ = 0.0009 * x / log x := by ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/TMEEMT/Variantdf0cc5cdc87c1f6277b620577206ad231a045643409701af4a15f869c1341795.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/TMEEMT/Variantdf0cc5cdc87c1f6277b620577206ad231a045643409701af4a15f869c1341795.lean#L213).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b621f1aa334bf7d3760b92c847894510fa068a54` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
