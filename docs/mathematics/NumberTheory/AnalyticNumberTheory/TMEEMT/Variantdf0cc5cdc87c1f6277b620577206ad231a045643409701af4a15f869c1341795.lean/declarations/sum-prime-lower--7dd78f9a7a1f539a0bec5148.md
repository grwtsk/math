## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4d8c5760-9817-c4a5-ef23-cf37e24833d7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1069–1080.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem sum_prime_lower (k : ℕ) (hk : k ≥ 6309751) :
    ∑ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 k, (nth_prime' i : ℝ) ≥
      (k : ℝ) ^ 2 / 4 + (k : ℝ) ^ 2 / (4 * log k) -
      (k : ℝ) ^ 2 * (log (log k) - 2.9) / (4 * (log k) ^ 2) := by sorry

@[blueprint
  "thm:axler2019-sum-prime-upper"
  (title := "Axler 2019, upper bound for sum of first k primes")
  (statement := /-- For $k \geq 256{,}376$, we have
  $\sum_{i \leq k} p_i \leq \frac{k^2}{4} + \frac{k^2}{4\log k} -
  \frac{k^2(\log\log k - 4.42)}{4(\log k)^2}$. -/)
  (latexEnv := "theorem")]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/TMEEMT/Variantdf0cc5cdc87c1f6277b620577206ad231a045643409701af4a15f869c1341795.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/TMEEMT/Variantdf0cc5cdc87c1f6277b620577206ad231a045643409701af4a15f869c1341795.lean#L1069).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b621f1aa334bf7d3760b92c847894510fa068a54` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
