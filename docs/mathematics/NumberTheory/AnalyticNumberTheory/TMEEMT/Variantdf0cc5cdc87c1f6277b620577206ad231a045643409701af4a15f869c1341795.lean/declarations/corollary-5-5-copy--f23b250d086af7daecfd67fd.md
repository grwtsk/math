## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0abbcefb7d877f7d4949553a5955c2b99e515d1ce97f33368366be2b9b04bfe2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1225–1239.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def corollary_5_5_copy {x : ℝ} (hx : x ≥ 468991632) :
    HasPrimeInInterval x (x * (1 + 1 / (5000 * (log x) ^ 2))) :=
  _root_.Dusart.corollary_5_5 hx

end Dusart

namespace Dudek2014

@[blueprint
  "thm:dudek2014"
  (title := "Dudek 2014")
  (statement := /-- If $x > \exp(\exp(34.32))$, then there is a prime in the interval
  \[ \left( x, x + 3x^{2/3} \right]. \]
  -/)
  (latexEnv := "theorem")]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/TMEEMT/Variantdf0cc5cdc87c1f6277b620577206ad231a045643409701af4a15f869c1341795.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/TMEEMT/Variantdf0cc5cdc87c1f6277b620577206ad231a045643409701af4a15f869c1341795.lean#L1225).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b621f1aa334bf7d3760b92c847894510fa068a54` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
