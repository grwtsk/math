## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aace0e67-ca11-e7f4-9a66-3aa9fa30e2c5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 758–766.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem theorem_f (x : ℝ) (hx : x ≥ 200) :
    pi_r 4 x ≤ 0.237 * x ^ 5 / log x := by sorry

@[blueprint
  "thm:dn-pi5-upper"
  (title := "Del\\'eglise-Nicolas 2019, $\\pi_5$ upper bound")
  (statement := /-- For $x \geq 44$, $\pi_5(x) \leq 0.226\, x^6 / \log x$.
  (Note: the wiki page lists $x^5$ here, but the consistent pattern $x^{r+1}$ and the general bound require $x^6$.) -/)
  (latexEnv := "theorem")]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/TMEEMT/Variant36a065635fb2a0e979b71a66284b3ed24cdf4448e794fda757de2ac4325e73c2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/TMEEMT/Variant36a065635fb2a0e979b71a66284b3ed24cdf4448e794fda757de2ac4325e73c2.lean#L758).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `48d4d2cfb80e1c05e8d56aede28538b71e5d9aa4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
