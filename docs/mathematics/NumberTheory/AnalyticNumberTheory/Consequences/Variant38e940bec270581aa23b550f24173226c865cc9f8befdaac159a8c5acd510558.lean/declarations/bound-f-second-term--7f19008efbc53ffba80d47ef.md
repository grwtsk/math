## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:abefadfa-be70-a6b0-03b0-58ec8952806e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1200–1229.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma bound_f_second_term (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : Tendsto f atTop (nhds 0)) (δ : ℝ) (hδ : δ > 0) :
    ∀ᶠ x : ℝ in atTop, (1 + f x) < (1 + δ) := by
  have bound_one_plus_f: ∀ y: ℝ, ∀ z: ℝ, |f y| < z → 1 + (f y) < 1 + z := by
    intro y z hf

  have f_small := NormedAddGroup.tendsto_nhds_zero.mp hf δ hδ
  simp only [norm_eq_abs, eventually_atTop, ge_iff_le] at f_small
  obtain ⟨p, hp⟩ := f_small

  let a := ((max 1 p) : ℝ)
  have ha: ∀ b: ℝ, a ≤ b → |f b| < δ := by
    intro b hb
    have b_ge_p: p ≤ b := by

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Consequences/Variant38e940bec270581aa23b550f24173226c865cc9f8befdaac159a8c5acd510558.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Consequences/Variant38e940bec270581aa23b550f24173226c865cc9f8befdaac159a8c5acd510558.lean#L1200).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0c16c416971c366503f7f5ff829e7c163fa4c9df` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
