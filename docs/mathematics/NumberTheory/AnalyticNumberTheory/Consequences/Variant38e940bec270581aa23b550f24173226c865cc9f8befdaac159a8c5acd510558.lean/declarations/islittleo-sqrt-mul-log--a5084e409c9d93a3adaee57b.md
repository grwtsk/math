## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c7527e91-09a4-4006-e9bd-c85cf2255f48`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 132–140.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isLittleO_sqrt_mul_log : (fun x : ℝ ↦ x.sqrt * x.log) =o[atTop] _root_.id := by
  have : (fun x : ℝ ↦ x.sqrt * x.log) =o[atTop] fun x ↦ x := by

    · convert isLittleO_log_rpow_atTop (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) < 1 / 2) using 2 with x
      rw [div_sqrt, sqrt_eq_rpow]

/-- `(⌊x⌋₊ + 1) / x → 1` as `x → ∞`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Consequences/Variant38e940bec270581aa23b550f24173226c865cc9f8befdaac159a8c5acd510558.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Consequences/Variant38e940bec270581aa23b550f24173226c865cc9f8befdaac159a8c5acd510558.lean#L132).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0c16c416971c366503f7f5ff829e7c163fa4c9df` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
