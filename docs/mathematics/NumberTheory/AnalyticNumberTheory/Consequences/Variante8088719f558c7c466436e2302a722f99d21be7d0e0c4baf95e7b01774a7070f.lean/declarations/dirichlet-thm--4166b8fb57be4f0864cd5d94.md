## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:931d3e1f-2576-1a14-6abe-4a59b66fbb3c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2536–2564.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

blueprint_comment /--
\begin{lemma}[Cyclotomic Chebotarev]\label{Chebotarev-cyclic}  For any $a$ coprime to $m$,
$$ \sum_{N \mathfrak{p} \leq x; N \mathfrak{p} = a\ (m)} \log N \mathfrak{p}  =
\frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{N \mathfrak{p} \leq x} \log N \mathfrak{p}.$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}\uses{Dedekind-PNT, WeakPNT-AP} This should follow from Lemma \ref{Dedekind-PNT} by a Fourier expansion.
\end{proof}

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Consequences/Variante8088719f558c7c466436e2302a722f99d21be7d0e0c4baf95e7b01774a7070f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Consequences/Variante8088719f558c7c466436e2302a722f99d21be7d0e0c4baf95e7b01774a7070f.lean#L2536).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0d55aed8d28b87d0341356666e0dbf58ba828e44` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
