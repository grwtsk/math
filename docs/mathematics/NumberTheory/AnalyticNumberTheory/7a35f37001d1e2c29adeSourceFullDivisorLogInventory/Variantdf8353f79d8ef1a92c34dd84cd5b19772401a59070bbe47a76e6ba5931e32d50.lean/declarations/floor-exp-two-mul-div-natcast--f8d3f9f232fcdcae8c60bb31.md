## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:451814b9-4a52-0dae-3a78-26dccb5ad1fb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 127–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem floor_exp_two_mul_div_natCast (A : ℝ) (m : ℕ) :
    ⌊Real.exp (2 * A) / (m : ℝ)⌋₊ = sourceKernelCutoff A / m := by
  by_cases hm : m = 0
  · subst m
    simp
  have hmc : (m : ℝ) ≠ 0 := by exact_mod_cast hm
  have h := Nat.mul_cast_floor_div_cancel hm (Real.exp (2 * A) / (m : ℝ))
  rw [div_mul_cancel₀ _ hmc] at h
  simpa only [sourceKernelCutoff, sourceUpper] using h.symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/7a35f37001d1e2c29adeSourceFullDivisorLogInventory/Variantdf8353f79d8ef1a92c34dd84cd5b19772401a59070bbe47a76e6ba5931e32d50.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/7a35f37001d1e2c29adeSourceFullDivisorLogInventory/Variantdf8353f79d8ef1a92c34dd84cd5b19772401a59070bbe47a76e6ba5931e32d50.lean#L127).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aecb2aa5253778e26a05be92e95feeeaf9833158` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
