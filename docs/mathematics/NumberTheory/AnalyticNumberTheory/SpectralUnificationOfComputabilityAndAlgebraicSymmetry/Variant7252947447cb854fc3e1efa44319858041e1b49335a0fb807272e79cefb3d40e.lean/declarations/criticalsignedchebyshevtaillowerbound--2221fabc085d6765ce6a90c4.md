## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f69b8222963e2b627992277f9d9d30d42a84010509a95453b22f30be94d64196`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 191–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def CriticalSignedChebyshevTailLowerBound : Prop :=
  ∃ C : ℝ, 0 ≤ C ∧ ∃ R : ℝ, 1 ≤ R ∧
    ∀ A : ℝ, R ≤ A → -C ≤ criticalSignedChebyshevIntegral A

/-- Exact signed reduction; no pointwise bound for the Chebyshev error is assumed. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variant7252947447cb854fc3e1efa44319858041e1b49335a0fb807272e79cefb3d40e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variant7252947447cb854fc3e1efa44319858041e1b49335a0fb807272e79cefb3d40e.lean#L191).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `45348fe9b2d6106809e2d7eb0e595f9bfaedc762` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
