## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2f038461e8d7d41922af8b25bd7e985909ebab4bc60b2f58026d5348d166f9de`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 24–29.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def primeFirstMoment (A : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ∑ p ∈ (primePowerInventory (2 * A)).filter Nat.Prime,
    Real.log (p : ℝ) / Real.sqrt p *
      sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A (Real.log p)

/-- Every even exponent is represented by squaring a prime power, without doubling `Λ`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variant6e75164d9bcce50ca39ba33459a86b87645aa78d5ef6193608660be7f0f72284.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variant6e75164d9bcce50ca39ba33459a86b87645aa78d5ef6193608660be7f0f72284.lean#L24).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0650d99ed8929b18de14c0caf38ed073c52b5b98` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
