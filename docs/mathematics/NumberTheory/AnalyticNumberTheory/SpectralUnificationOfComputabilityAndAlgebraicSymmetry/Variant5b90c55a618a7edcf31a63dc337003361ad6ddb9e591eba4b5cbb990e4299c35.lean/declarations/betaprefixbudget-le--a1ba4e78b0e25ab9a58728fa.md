## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1eb8958d-7173-83e2-65ac-78032a56aeff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 27–36.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem betaPrefixBudget_le (U : ℕ) : betaPrefixBudget U ≤ (U : ℝ) := by
  unfold betaPrefixBudget
  calc
    _ ≤ ∑ d ∈ Finset.Icc 1 U, (1 : ℝ) := by
      apply Finset.sum_le_sum
      intro d hd
      exact_mod_cast (abs_moebius_le_one (n := d))
    _ = _ := by simp [Nat.card_Icc]

/-- The exact ceil-bin anchor is at least half its exponential lower endpoint. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variant5b90c55a618a7edcf31a63dc337003361ad6ddb9e591eba4b5cbb990e4299c35.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variant5b90c55a618a7edcf31a63dc337003361ad6ddb9e591eba4b5cbb990e4299c35.lean#L27).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6c2c0a770235d3adc6e76252ad841135c5f2b206` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
