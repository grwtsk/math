## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f67a4bb671ce170a9a44cf713855bd75511b4bd2c323dcbec3a88902c0565824`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–50.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def typeTwoSource (A : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ∑ m ∈ Finset.Ioc (vaughanCutoff A) (sourceKernelCutoff A),
    ∑ n ∈ (Finset.Ioc (vaughanCutoff A) (sourceKernelCutoff A)).filter
      (fun n ↦ m*n ≤ sourceKernelCutoff A),
      vonMangoldt m * beta (vaughanCutoff A) n / Real.sqrt ((m*n : ℕ) : ℝ) *
        sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A (Real.log m + Real.log n)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variantc06a6534710f8067a3a820bc14180b5f2afb58aa2b2db39256038ab93192b08f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variantc06a6534710f8067a3a820bc14180b5f2afb58aa2b2db39256038ab93192b08f.lean#L44).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f1b67b7aad44d81910a75cca43636e9d79411eb9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
