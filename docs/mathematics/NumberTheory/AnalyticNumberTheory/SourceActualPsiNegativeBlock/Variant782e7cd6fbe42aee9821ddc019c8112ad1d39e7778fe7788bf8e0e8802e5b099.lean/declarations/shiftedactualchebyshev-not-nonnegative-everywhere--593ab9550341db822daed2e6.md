## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b2b0953b-c55d-a219-fac7-9d6b4d9332ce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–80.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem shiftedActualChebyshev_not_nonnegative_everywhere :
    ¬ ∀ y : ℝ, 2 ≤ y → 0 ≤ shiftedActualChebyshev y := by
  intro h
  have hlo := h (13 / 2) (by norm_num)
  have hhi := shiftedActualChebyshev_negative_on_block (13 / 2) le_rfl (by norm_num)
  linarith

end RH16ActualPsiNegativeBlock
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/SourceActualPsiNegativeBlock/Variant782e7cd6fbe42aee9821ddc019c8112ad1d39e7778fe7788bf8e0e8802e5b099.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/SourceActualPsiNegativeBlock/Variant782e7cd6fbe42aee9821ddc019c8112ad1d39e7778fe7788bf8e0e8802e5b099.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `663f62ff65817f44a2afc18ba2b681245f88b7bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
