## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8851fcde-943a-eab4-62b8-43d9f93af4ba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 89–121.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

private lemma integral_log_mul_exp_neg_eq_deriv_Gamma :
    ∫ t in Ioi (0:ℝ), Real.log t * Real.exp (-t) = deriv Real.Gamma 1 := by
  set I : ℝ := ∫ t in Ioi (0:ℝ), Real.log t * Real.exp (-t) with hI
  -- Step 1: derivative of GammaIntegral at 1.
  have h1 := Complex.hasDerivAt_GammaIntegral (s := (1 : ℂ)) (by norm_num)
  -- Step 2: simplify the integrand to `↑(log t * exp (-t))` and pull out `ofReal`.
  have hval : (∫ t : ℝ in Ioi 0, (↑t : ℂ) ^ ((1 : ℂ) - 1) * (↑(Real.log t) * ↑(Real.exp (-t))))
      = (I : ℂ) := by

where `Finset` is open and would clash with `Set.Ioi`). -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/UpstreamMertens/Variant6f71a221604463ba1479872012cfb12b885a9e6a8f8abb87a08b4c12c4dca60b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/UpstreamMertens/Variant6f71a221604463ba1479872012cfb12b885a9e6a8f8abb87a08b4c12c4dca60b.lean#L89).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1c45fc368e4fc7c3ff7876be4f8e67c3d6f2a6be` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
