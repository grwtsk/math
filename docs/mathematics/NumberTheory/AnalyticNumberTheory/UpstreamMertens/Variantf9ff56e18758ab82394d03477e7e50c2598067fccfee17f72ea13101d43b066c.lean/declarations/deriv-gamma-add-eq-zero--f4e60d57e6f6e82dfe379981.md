## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dcbfab27-960a-b179-5054-082f75e5bfd2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1914–1934.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem deriv_gamma_add_γ_eq_zero : deriv Gamma 1 + γ = 0 := by
  -- For `s > 1`, `log_zeta_eq` rearranges to a constant identity.
  have key : ∀ s : ℝ, 1 < s →
      (Real.log (riemannZeta (s:ℂ)).re + Real.log (s - 1))
        - (s - 1) * ∫ x in Set.Ioi 1, E₂Λ x * x ^ (-s) = deriv Gamma 1 + γ := by
    intro s hs
    have h := log_zeta_eq s hs
    linarith

  have hconst : Filter.Tendsto

        - (s - 1) * ∫ x in Set.Ioi 1, E₂Λ x * x ^ (-s))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/UpstreamMertens/Variantf9ff56e18758ab82394d03477e7e50c2598067fccfee17f72ea13101d43b066c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/UpstreamMertens/Variantf9ff56e18758ab82394d03477e7e50c2598067fccfee17f72ea13101d43b066c.lean#L1914).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `72f13f20811406bb11ec92b1f7aebf3c765af560` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
