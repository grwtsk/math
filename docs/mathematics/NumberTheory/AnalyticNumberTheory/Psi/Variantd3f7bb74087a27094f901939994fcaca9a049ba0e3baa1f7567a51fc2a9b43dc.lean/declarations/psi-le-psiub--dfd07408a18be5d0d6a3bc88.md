## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:72406cb8-94c4-0bb5-d482-3ac670676d5f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 69–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem psi_le_psiUB (N : Nat) (depth : Nat) :
    psi (N : Real) <= (psiUB N depth : Real) := by
  unfold psi psiUB
  rw [Nat.floor_natCast]
  rw [Rat.cast_sum]
  exact Finset.sum_le_sum fun n _ => vonMangoldt_le_vonMangoldtUB n depth

/-! ### Decidable comparison infrastructure -/

/-- Master theorem: if `psiUB(N, depth) <= slope` is verified computationally,
then `psi(N) <= slope`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Psi/Variantd3f7bb74087a27094f901939994fcaca9a049ba0e3baa1f7567a51fc2a9b43dc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Psi/Variantd3f7bb74087a27094f901939994fcaca9a049ba0e3baa1f7567a51fc2a9b43dc.lean#L69).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3b5e73eccb695d7ba489001e0676bcd56fb94a97` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
