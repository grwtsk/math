## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:01dd75df-3d0d-1d23-0af2-7b17d016a54a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 765–771.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private lemma sum_k_mul_half_pow_le (K : ℕ) :
    ∑ k ∈ Icc 1 K, (k : ℝ) * (2⁻¹) ^ k ≤ 2 := by
  have h := sum_k_mul_half_pow_aux K
  nlinarith [h, pow_nonneg (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) ≤ 2⁻¹) K,
    (by positivity : (0 : ℝ) ≤ (K : ℝ) + 2)]

/-- log²m/m² ≤ 64·(m^{7/4})⁻¹ for m ≥ 2 (via log m ≤ 8·m^{1/8}). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Chebyshev/Variantc80386abec77eaae9737c861e090a33eeb9cf80b8b7a0d371e257676007743e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Chebyshev/Variantc80386abec77eaae9737c861e090a33eeb9cf80b8b7a0d371e257676007743e7.lean#L765).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8d0d154c5fb6a7cec2352a0772b4b1a09c38ce3b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
