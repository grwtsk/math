## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8ec2629b-0c40-785f-5b91-a461caa906c9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1000–1005.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private lemma defect_bounded :
    ∃ C : ℝ, 0 < C ∧ ∀ x : ℝ,
      ∑ n ∈ Ioc 0 ⌊x⌋₊, Λ n * (Real.log n - Λ n) / n ≤ C :=
  ⟨1537, by norm_num, defect_bounded_explicit⟩

/-- [eq:cheb2].1 with the constant explicit: C2a = 2(log 4 + 4) + 1537/log 2 (≤ 2230). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Chebyshev/Variantc80386abec77eaae9737c861e090a33eeb9cf80b8b7a0d371e257676007743e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Chebyshev/Variantc80386abec77eaae9737c861e090a33eeb9cf80b8b7a0d371e257676007743e7.lean#L1000).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8d0d154c5fb6a7cec2352a0772b4b1a09c38ce3b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
