## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:902dc42040d3448771517f98111e4a058286d83a53cbf818839ea2a787d1008b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 37–48.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def T (x : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ∑ n ∈ Finset.Icc 1 ⌊x⌋₊, log n

@[blueprint
  "cheby-T-upper"
  (title := "Upper bound on $T$")
  (statement := /-- For $x \geq 1$, we have $T(x) \leq x \log x - x + 1 + \log x$. -/)
  (proof := /-- Upper bound $\log n$ by $\int_n^{n+1} \log t\ dt$ for $n < x-1$ and by $\log x$ for $x-1 < n \leq x$ to bound
  $$T(x) \leq \int_1^x \log t\ dt + \log x$$
  giving the claim. -/)
  (latexEnv := "lemma")
  (discussion := 831)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Chebyshev/Variantc6522001fc61cc44cf104a10928cdb8c4d7aed1c7e2aa275a844fd6b5497d1c3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Chebyshev/Variantc6522001fc61cc44cf104a10928cdb8c4d7aed1c7e2aa275a844fd6b5497d1c3.lean#L37).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `045466a6d1938b36edf6ae23c75be1b0d2dda31f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
