## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7646f882-fb85-7927-4ef2-c00c2d96b85c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 17–35.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem factorization_lcm {β : Type*} {f : β → ℕ} {s : Finset β}
    (hf : ∀ k ∈ s, f k ≠ 0) (p : ℕ) :
    (s.lcm f).factorization p = s.sup fun a => (f a).factorization p := by
  induction s using Finset.induction with
  | empty =>
    simp [lcm, fold_empty, factorization_one, Finsupp.coe_zero, sup_empty]
  | insert _ _ _ _ =>
    simp_all [lcm_eq_nat_lcm, Nat.factorization_lcm]

end Finset

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Chebyshev/Variant3541e3f1c65c88dfbbf5a4f63233b2042930b1386d7f1ac156e55756a1869a45.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/Chebyshev/Variant3541e3f1c65c88dfbbf5a4f63233b2042930b1386d7f1ac156e55756a1869a45.lean#L17).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d5b14c82c28efbe9825a159c81cc676ea84d6ace` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
