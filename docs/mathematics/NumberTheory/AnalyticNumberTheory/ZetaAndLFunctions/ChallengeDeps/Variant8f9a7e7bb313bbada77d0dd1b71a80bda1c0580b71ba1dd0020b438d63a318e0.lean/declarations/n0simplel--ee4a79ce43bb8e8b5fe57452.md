## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b0ea02e522d22785ef591bee314482f23d5c17f8c0ffcea24f6bad2d14b0aa6a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–105.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def N0simpleL (T₁ T₂ : ℝ) : ℕ :=
  (zerosInL χ T₁ T₂ ∩ {ρ | ρ.re = 1 / 2} ∩ {ρ | zeroMultL χ ρ = 1}).ncard

end Dirichlet

/-! ## 3. The Montgomery–Taylor constant of Theorem D -/

/-- c₁* := √2·tan ϑ / (1 + ϑ·tan ϑ) at ϑ = 1/√2 — the paper's closed form for the optimal-window
constant c*_λ = √2·tan ϑ/(1 + ϑ·tan ϑ), ϑ = λ/√2, at λ = 1. Numerically c₁* = 0.7532960…
(= 2·tan(1/√2)/(√2 + tan(1/√2)); 1/c₁* = 1/2 + 2^{-1/2}·cot(2^{-1/2}) is the Montgomery–Taylor
constant). Theorem D's proportions here are 2 − 1/c₁* = 0.67250… (for N₀* and N₀ˢ) and
(3 − 1/c₁*)/2 = 0.83625… (for N_d); the decimals are NOT part of the formal statements. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/ChallengeDeps/Variant8f9a7e7bb313bbada77d0dd1b71a80bda1c0580b71ba1dd0020b438d63a318e0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/ChallengeDeps/Variant8f9a7e7bb313bbada77d0dd1b71a80bda1c0580b71ba1dd0020b438d63a318e0.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `48f822a3c82e9fe337839907151b91d786b2f650` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
