## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f2b5ec17ad293a932048aad3d27467254f0319920d2e68b6cb2a3d37f6c4cd95`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 204–213.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def d (k : ℕ) : ArithmeticFunction ℕ := zeta ^ k

/-- `d 0` is the multiplicative identity (indicator at 1). -/
@[blueprint
  "d_zero"
  (title := "d zero")
  (statement := /-- $d_0$ is the multiplicative identity (indicator at 1). -/)
  (proof := /--
  By definition, $d_k$ is the $k$-fold Dirichlet convolution of $\zeta$. When $k = 0$, this corresponds to the empty convolution, which is defined to be the multiplicative identity in the algebra of arithmetic functions. The multiplicative identity is the function that takes the value $1$ at $n=1$ and $0$ elsewhere, which can be expressed as $\zeta^0$.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/IwaniecKowalskiCh1/Variantea69b0b97d559cfe95d52b5b11cc61d4db07ad85ec6726005ebe6722cea0ebcb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/IwaniecKowalskiCh1/Variantea69b0b97d559cfe95d52b5b11cc61d4db07ad85ec6726005ebe6722cea0ebcb.lean#L204).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d1e130d856dabeec0e70683332be624b1a15c231` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
