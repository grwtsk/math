## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f119d3df-ff24-a529-9b77-014e241d440d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 82–98.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma unique_divisor_decomposition {a b d : ℕ} (hab : Coprime a b) (hd : d ∣ a * b) :
    ∃! p : ℕ × ℕ, p.1 ∣ a ∧ p.2 ∣ b ∧ p.1 * p.2 = d := by
  sorry -- UPSTREAMED TO MATHLIB #36495

/-- If `f` is a multiplicative arithmetic function, then for coprime `a` and `b`, we have $\sum_{d | ab} f(d) = (\sum_{d | a} f(d)) \cdot (\sum_{d | b} f(d))$. -/

  (statement := /-- If $f$ is a multiplicative arithmetic function, then for coprime, nonzero $a$ and $b$, we have that
  $\sum_{d | ab} f(d) = (\sum_{d | a} f(d)) \cdot (\sum_{d | b} f(d))$.
  \begin{verbatim}

  \end{verbatim}
  -/)
  (proof := /--
  Since $f$ is multiplicative, we can express the sum over divisors of $ab$ in terms of the sums over divisors of $a$ and $b$. The key idea is to use the fact that the divisors of $ab$ can be expressed as products of divisors of $a$ and divisors of $b$, due to the coprimality condition. Specifically, each divisor $d$ of $ab$ can be uniquely written as $d = d_a * d_b$, where $d_a$ divides $a$ and $d_b$ divides $b$. Therefore, we can rewrite the sum as a double sum over the divisors of $a$ and $b$, which factorizes into the product of the two separate sums.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/IwaniecKowalskiCh1/Variantea69b0b97d559cfe95d52b5b11cc61d4db07ad85ec6726005ebe6722cea0ebcb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/IwaniecKowalskiCh1/Variantea69b0b97d559cfe95d52b5b11cc61d4db07ad85ec6726005ebe6722cea0ebcb.lean#L82).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d1e130d856dabeec0e70683332be624b1a15c231` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
