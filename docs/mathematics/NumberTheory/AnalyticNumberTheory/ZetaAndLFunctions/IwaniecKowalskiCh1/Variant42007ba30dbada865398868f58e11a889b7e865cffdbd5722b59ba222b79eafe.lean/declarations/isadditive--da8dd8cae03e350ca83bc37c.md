## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3ab1f1655515b9512aeca4f536800ff7abc40cd32541e092cf2886e3865e89c4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 50–56.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IsAdditive [AddZeroClass R] (f : ArithmeticFunction R) : Prop :=
  ∀ {m n : ℕ}, m ≠ 0 → n ≠ 0 → Coprime m n → f (m * n) = f m + f n

@[blueprint
  "IsCompletelyAdditive"
  (title := "IsCompletelyAdditive")
  (statement := /-- Completely additive arithmetic function: satisfies $f(mn) = f(m) + f(n)$ for all $m, n \ne 0$. -/)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/IwaniecKowalskiCh1/Variant42007ba30dbada865398868f58e11a889b7e865cffdbd5722b59ba222b79eafe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/IwaniecKowalskiCh1/Variant42007ba30dbada865398868f58e11a889b7e865cffdbd5722b59ba222b79eafe.lean#L50).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f10936542ce26f4e3d13f8c80e4a797c94ed7c9e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
