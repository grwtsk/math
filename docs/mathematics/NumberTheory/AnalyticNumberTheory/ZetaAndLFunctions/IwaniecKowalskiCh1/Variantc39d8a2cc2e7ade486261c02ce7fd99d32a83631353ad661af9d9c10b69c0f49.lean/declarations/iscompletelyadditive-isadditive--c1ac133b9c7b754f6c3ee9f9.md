## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7acb06a2-e811-09ba-71dd-32a25b4b6453`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 57–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma IsCompletelyAdditive.isAdditive [AddZeroClass R] {f : ArithmeticFunction R}
    (hf : IsCompletelyAdditive f) : IsAdditive f :=
  fun hm hn _ ↦ hf hm hn

-- **Think about more API for additive/completely additive functions, e.g. `f (p^k) = k * f p` for prime p, etc.**

  "unique_divisor_decomposition"
  (title := "unique divisor decomposition")
  (statement := /-- If $a$ and $b$ are coprime, then any divisor $d$ of $ab$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of a divisor of $a$ and a divisor of $b$.
    \begin{verbatim}
  This has been upstreamed #36495.
  \end{verbatim}
-/)
  (proof := /--
  Let $a$ and $b$ be coprime natural numbers, and let $d$ be a divisor of $ab$. Since $a$ and $b$ are coprime, we can use the fact that the divisors of $ab$ correspond to pairs of divisors of $a$ and $b$. Specifically, we can express $d$ as $d = d_a \cdot d_b$, where $d_a$ divides $a$ and $d_b$ divides $b$. The uniqueness of this decomposition follows from the coprimality of $a$ and $b$, which ensures that the divisors of $a$ and $b$ do not share any common factors. Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the divisors of $ab$ and the pairs of divisors of $a$ and $b$, which guarantees the uniqueness of the decomposition.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/IwaniecKowalskiCh1/Variantc39d8a2cc2e7ade486261c02ce7fd99d32a83631353ad661af9d9c10b69c0f49.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/IwaniecKowalskiCh1/Variantc39d8a2cc2e7ade486261c02ce7fd99d32a83631353ad661af9d9c10b69c0f49.lean#L57).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cf9bfc459f0e3cd584d2ef9726e580780198b141` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
