## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8ce55f80-49da-96b5-a0e9-27339430af47`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 178–194.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem differentiableAt_deriv_riemannZeta {s : ℂ} (s_ne_one : s ≠ 1) :
    DifferentiableAt ℂ ζ' s := by
  exact (analyticAt_riemannZeta s_ne_one).deriv.differentiableAt


@[blueprint
  (title := "riemannZetaResidue")
  (statement := /--
  The Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ has a simple pole at $s=1$ with residue $1$. In particular,
  the function $\zeta(s) - \frac{1}{s-1}$ is bounded in a neighborhood of $s=1$.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
  From \texttt{riemannZeta\_residue\_one} (in Mathlib), we know that
  $(s-1)\zeta(s)$ goes to $1$ as $s\to1$. Now apply Theorem \ref{ResidueOfTendsTo}.
  (This can also be done using $\zeta_0$ below, which is expressed as
  $1/(s-1)$ plus things that are holomorphic for $\Re(s)>0$...)
  -/)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/ZetaBounds/Variant9da671a08345cd293ad94af72c0e32337c5bd47e70ecff98fc802607393dcd79.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/ZetaBounds/Variant9da671a08345cd293ad94af72c0e32337c5bd47e70ecff98fc802607393dcd79.lean#L178).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1221067f6024cf817e255715555eb90609acba6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
