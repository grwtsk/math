## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e90183a5-ebc0-94a1-4e3e-7dcc155a553c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 3261–3291.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

blueprint_comment /--
Then, since $\zeta$ doesn't vanish on the 1-line, there is a $\sigma<1$ (depending on $T$), so that
the box $[\sigma,1] \times_{ℂ} [-T,T]$ is free of zeros of $\zeta$.

  (title := "ZetaNoZerosInBox")
  (statement := /--
  For any $T>0$, there is a constant $\sigma<1$ so that
  $$
  \zeta(\sigma'+it) \ne 0
  $$
  for all $|t| \leq T$ and $\sigma' \ge \sigma$.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
  Assume not. Then there is a sequence $|t_n| \le T$ and $\sigma_n \to 1$ so that
  $\zeta(\sigma_n + it_n) = 0$.
  By compactness, there is a subsequence $t_{n_k} \to t_0$ along which
  $\zeta(\sigma_{n_k} + it_{n_k}) = 0$.
  If $t_0\ne0$, use the continuity of $\zeta$ to get that $\zeta(1 + it_0) = 0$;
  this is a contradiction.
  If $t_0=0$, $\zeta$ blows up near $1$, so can't be zero nearby.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/ZetaBounds/Variant05e47c86c1d85218e57bae551fd5db56371f0aeb3127e169822a2dd2200d96fe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/ZetaBounds/Variant05e47c86c1d85218e57bae551fd5db56371f0aeb3127e169822a2dd2200d96fe.lean#L3261).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8449749700ae3c61707103913ebe40c0507a6e07` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
