## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:21b8b9f4-ce8e-de7e-11af-bf30f6885e22`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 197–218.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem deriv_eqOn_of_eqOn_punctured (f g : ℂ → ℂ) (U : Set ℂ) (p : ℂ)
    (hU_open : IsOpen U)
    (h_eq : EqOn f g (U \ {p})) :
    EqOn (deriv f) (deriv g) (U \ {p}) := by
  -- We need to show that for any x ∈ U \ {p}, deriv f x = deriv g x
  intro x hx
  -- hx : x ∈ U \ {p}, so x ∈ U and x ≠ p
  have hx_in_U : x ∈ U := hx.1
  have hx_ne_p : x ≠ p := hx.2
  -- Since f and g agree on U \ {p} and x ≠ p,
  -- we can find a neighborhood of x where f = g
  have h_eq_nhds : ∀ᶠ y in 𝓝 x, f y = g y := by
    -- Since x ≠ p and U \ {p} is open (as U is open and {p} is closed),
    -- and f = g on U \ {p}, we have f = g in a neighborhood of x
    rw [eventually_nhds_iff]
    use U \ {p}
    exact ⟨h_eq, hU_open.sdiff isClosed_singleton, hx⟩
  -- Now use the fact that if f = g in a neighborhood, then deriv f = deriv g

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/ZetaBounds/Variant05e47c86c1d85218e57bae551fd5db56371f0aeb3127e169822a2dd2200d96fe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/ZetaBounds/Variant05e47c86c1d85218e57bae551fd5db56371f0aeb3127e169822a2dd2200d96fe.lean#L197).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8449749700ae3c61707103913ebe40c0507a6e07` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
