## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aa439c25-b3b7-c623-3aa9-433e0f96c6cc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 391–407.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  have hA : AnalyticOnNhd ℂ riemannZeta ({1}ᶜ : Set ℂ) := analyticOnNhd_riemannZeta (by simp)
  have hd : Continuous (fun t : ℝ => deriv riemannZeta (2 + t * I)) :=

  have hz : Continuous (fun t : ℝ => riemannZeta (2 + t * I)) :=
    hA.continuousOn.comp_continuous hγ (fun t => two_add_mul_I_ne_one t)
  have hne : ∀ t : ℝ, riemannZeta (2 + t * I) ≠ 0 := fun t h => by
    have := re_riemannZeta_two_pos t; rw [h] at this; simp at this

/-- **Vertical side σ = 2.** `|Im (∫_{T₁}^{T₂} ζ'/ζ(2+it)·i dt)| ≤ π` for all `T₁, T₂`:
`log ζ(2+it)` is a primitive, and `|arg ζ(2+it)| ≤ π/2` since `Re ζ(2+it) > 0`.
(The sharper constant `2 log 3` also holds — |arg| ≤ arcsin(π²/6−1) — but an absolute
constant suffices for the consumer.) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/Backlund/Variant9cc0867e93eaed417e8d89ab9495d28fa2b352a25304387d84c24182b660dd8c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/Backlund/Variant9cc0867e93eaed417e8d89ab9495d28fa2b352a25304387d84c24182b660dd8c.lean#L391).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b53b984edd7dd34a14c656c928b79798ae274f69` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
