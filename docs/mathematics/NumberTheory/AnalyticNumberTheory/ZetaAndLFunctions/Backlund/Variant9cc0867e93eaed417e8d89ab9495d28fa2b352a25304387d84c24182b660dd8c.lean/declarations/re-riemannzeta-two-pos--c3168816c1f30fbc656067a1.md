## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fc5be5e0-9066-d9b1-d762-9143052133ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 356–363.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma re_riemannZeta_two_pos (t : ℝ) : 0 < (riemannZeta (2 + t * I)).re := by
  have h := norm_riemannZeta_sub_one_le (s := 2 + t * I) (by simp)
  have h2 : |(riemannZeta (2 + t * I) - 1).re| ≤ ‖riemannZeta (2 + t * I) - 1‖ :=
    Complex.abs_re_le_norm _
  rw [Complex.sub_re, Complex.one_re] at h2
  have h3 := (abs_le.mp (h2.trans h)).1
  linarith [pi_sq_div_six_sub_one_lt_one]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/Backlund/Variant9cc0867e93eaed417e8d89ab9495d28fa2b352a25304387d84c24182b660dd8c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/Backlund/Variant9cc0867e93eaed417e8d89ab9495d28fa2b352a25304387d84c24182b660dd8c.lean#L356).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b53b984edd7dd34a14c656c928b79798ae274f69` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
