## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a5357c56-fb36-a952-bf23-f3936e5be6e5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 199–205.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dirichlet_two_thirds_on_critical_line
    {q : ℕ} [NeZero q] (χ : DirichletCharacter ℂ q) (hq : 1 < q) (hχ : χ.IsPrimitive) :
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ T₀ : ℝ, ∀ T ≥ T₀, (2 / 3 - ε) * (NcountL χ T (2 * T) : ℝ) ≤ N0starL χ T (2 * T) := by
  sorry

/-- **Theorem E**: for every primitive Dirichlet character χ mod q > 1, at least 2/3 of the
nontrivial zeros of L(s,χ) are simple and on the critical line (dyadic windows). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/Challenge/Variant460fb9b1dce8fff3b1cee0bb41833acefb683dd80bb3101c2d270ebb662f69f8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/Challenge/Variant460fb9b1dce8fff3b1cee0bb41833acefb683dd80bb3101c2d270ebb662f69f8.lean#L199).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4fd6da2ac9259462416359c309249c302cc4a6a8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
