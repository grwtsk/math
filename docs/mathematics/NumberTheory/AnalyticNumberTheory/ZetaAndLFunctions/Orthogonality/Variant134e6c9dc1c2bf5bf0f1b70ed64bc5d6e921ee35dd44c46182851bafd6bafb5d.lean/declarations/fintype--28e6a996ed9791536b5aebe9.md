## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:60b4550ffa2ee44e9ee07f40ae7fd61e2f297786ee2fb249149983adc5adc31f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 34–41.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance fintype {R : Type*} [CommRing R] [IsDomain R] {n : ℕ} :
    Fintype (DirichletCharacter R n) := .ofFinite _

variable (R : Type*) [CommRing R] (n : ℕ) [NeZero n]
  [HasEnoughRootsOfUnity R (Monoid.exponent (ZMod n)ˣ)]

/-- The group of Dirichlet characters mod `n` with values in a ring `R` that has enough
roots of unity is (noncanonically) isomorphic to `(ZMod n)ˣ`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/Orthogonality/Variant134e6c9dc1c2bf5bf0f1b70ed64bc5d6e921ee35dd44c46182851bafd6bafb5d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/Orthogonality/Variant134e6c9dc1c2bf5bf0f1b70ed64bc5d6e921ee35dd44c46182851bafd6bafb5d.lean#L34).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `65b76094977e81a6fc9c04daa21bf0b51cc56340` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
