## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:334e96d5-0c12-5921-fe7b-9ec681eed4ec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 188–202.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    LSeriesSummable g s := by
  rw [← Nat.cofinite_eq_atTop] at h
  refine (summable_norm_iff.mpr hf).of_norm_bounded_eventually _ ?_
  have : term f s =ᶠ[cofinite] term g s := by
    rw [eventuallyEq_iff_exists_mem] at h ⊢
    obtain ⟨S, hS, hS'⟩ := h
    refine ⟨S \ {0}, diff_mem hS <| (Set.finite_singleton 0).compl_mem_cofinite, fun n hn ↦ ?_⟩
    rw [Set.mem_diff, Set.mem_singleton_iff] at hn

  exact this.symm.mono fun n hn ↦ by simp [hn]

/-- If `f` and `g` agree on large `n : ℕ`, then the `LSeries` of `f` converges at `s`
if and only if that of `g` does. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/Basic/Variantcb1621e35007e09c4982fdbf21e3f905ffdec92aead1d268e152fc8c534c7d04.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/Basic/Variantcb1621e35007e09c4982fdbf21e3f905ffdec92aead1d268e152fc8c534c7d04.lean#L188).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7d0781698b9f88d3b512423527c75ee40aab2383` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
