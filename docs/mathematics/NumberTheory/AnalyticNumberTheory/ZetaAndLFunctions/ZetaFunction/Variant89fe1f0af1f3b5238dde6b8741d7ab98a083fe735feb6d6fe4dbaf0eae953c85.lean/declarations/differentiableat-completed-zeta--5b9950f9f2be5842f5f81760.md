## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:18e96295-6948-e23b-26f9-4ddcd94b155f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 332–340.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem differentiableAt_completed_zeta {s : ℂ} (hs : s ≠ 0) (hs' : s ≠ 1) :
    DifferentiableAt ℂ riemannCompletedZeta s := by
  refine (differentiable_completed_zeta₀.differentiableAt.sub ?_).add ?_
  · exact (Differentiable.differentiableAt (differentiable_const _)).div differentiableAt_id hs
  · refine (differentiable_const _).differentiableAt.div ?_ (sub_ne_zero.mpr hs')
    exact differentiableAt_id.sub (differentiableAt_const _)
#align differentiable_at_completed_zeta differentiableAt_completed_zeta

/-- The Riemann zeta function is differentiable away from `s = 1`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/ZetaFunction/Variant89fe1f0af1f3b5238dde6b8741d7ab98a083fe735feb6d6fe4dbaf0eae953c85.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/ZetaFunction/Variant89fe1f0af1f3b5238dde6b8741d7ab98a083fe735feb6d6fe4dbaf0eae953c85.lean#L332).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `32fb55b80053cd2ceca6e621ffb4cda24a0f7394` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
