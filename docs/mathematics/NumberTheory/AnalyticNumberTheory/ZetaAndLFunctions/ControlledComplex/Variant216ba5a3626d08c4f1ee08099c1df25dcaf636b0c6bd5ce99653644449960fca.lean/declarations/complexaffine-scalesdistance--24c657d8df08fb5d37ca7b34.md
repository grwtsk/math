## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0a52ec21-4bc2-763c-bab0-0efd5322a2df`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 74–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem complexAffine_scalesDistance (a b z w : ℂ) (aNonzero : a ≠ 0) :
    ‖(a * z + b) - (a * w + b)‖ = ‖a‖ * ‖z - w‖ := by
  have _scalePositive : 0 < ‖a‖ := norm_pos_iff.mpr aNonzero
  rw [show (a * z + b) - (a * w + b) = a * (z - w) by ring, norm_mul]

/-- The classical Riemann-sphere carrier is the one-point compactification. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/ControlledComplex/Variant216ba5a3626d08c4f1ee08099c1df25dcaf636b0c6bd5ce99653644449960fca.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/ControlledComplex/Variant216ba5a3626d08c4f1ee08099c1df25dcaf636b0c6bd5ce99653644449960fca.lean#L74).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `41b53fe54794716fecb8d96347f22173743c6fb5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
