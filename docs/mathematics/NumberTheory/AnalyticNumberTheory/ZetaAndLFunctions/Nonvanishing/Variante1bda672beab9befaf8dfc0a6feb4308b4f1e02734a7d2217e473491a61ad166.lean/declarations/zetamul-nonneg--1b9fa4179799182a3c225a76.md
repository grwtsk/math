## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:98e84709-9152-36cf-a487-f48e57f4c454`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 116–135.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### "Bad" Dirichlet characters

Our goal is to show that `L(χ, 1) ≠ 0` when `χ` is a (nontrivial) quadratic Dirichlet character.
To do that, we package the contradictory properties in a (private) structure
`DirichletCharacter.BadChar` and derive further statements eventually leading to a contradiction.

This entire section is private.

/-- The object we're trying to show doesn't exist: A nontrivial quadratic Dirichlet character
whose L-function vanishes at `s = 1`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/Nonvanishing/Variante1bda672beab9befaf8dfc0a6feb4308b4f1e02734a7d2217e473491a61ad166.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/Nonvanishing/Variante1bda672beab9befaf8dfc0a6feb4308b4f1e02734a7d2217e473491a61ad166.lean#L116).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cbae5f92f156ca38b2415dd80ee90395416d9ac0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
