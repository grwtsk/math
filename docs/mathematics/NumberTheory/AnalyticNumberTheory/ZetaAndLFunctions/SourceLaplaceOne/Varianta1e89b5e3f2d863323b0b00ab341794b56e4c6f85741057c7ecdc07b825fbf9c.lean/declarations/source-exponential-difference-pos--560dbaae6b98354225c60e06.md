## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e4729bb9-3c26-6ec7-cb63-32e56e09dc9a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 19–30.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem source_exponential_difference_pos :
    0 < 36 * Real.exp 1 - 266 * Real.exp (-1) := by
  have he := Real.sum_le_exp_of_nonneg (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) ≤ 2) 12
  norm_num [Finset.sum_range_succ, Nat.factorial] at he
  have he' : (266 : ℝ) < 36 * Real.exp 2 := by linarith
  have hp : 0 < Real.exp (-1 : ℝ) := Real.exp_pos _
  have hx : Real.exp (1 : ℝ) = Real.exp 2 * Real.exp (-1) := by
    rw [← Real.exp_add]
    norm_num
  rw [hx]
  nlinarith [mul_pos (sub_pos.mpr he') hp]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/SourceLaplaceOne/Varianta1e89b5e3f2d863323b0b00ab341794b56e4c6f85741057c7ecdc07b825fbf9c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/SourceLaplaceOne/Varianta1e89b5e3f2d863323b0b00ab341794b56e4c6f85741057c7ecdc07b825fbf9c.lean#L19).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `295e1371e0c1024fd592de8700a0c3dc0a282b23` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
