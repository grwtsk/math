## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:feadbd62-6a7d-ea4f-41ac-4486a47c3d05`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 77–85.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma hasSum_hurwitzZeta_of_one_lt_re {a : ℝ} (ha : a ∈ Icc 0 1) {s : ℂ} (hs : 1 < re s) :
    HasSum (fun n : ℕ ↦ 1 / (n + a : ℂ) ^ s) (hurwitzZeta a s) := by
  convert (hasSum_nat_hurwitzZetaEven_of_mem_Icc ha hs).add
      (hasSum_nat_hurwitzZetaOdd_of_mem_Icc ha hs) using 1
  ext1 n
  -- plain `ring_nf` works here, but the following is faster:
  apply show ∀ (x y : ℂ), x = (x + y) / 2 + (x - y) / 2 by intros; ring

/-- The residue of the Hurwitz zeta function at `s = 1` is `1`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/HurwitzZeta/Variant3f368e6f7e98407e72f89bd546ad6bf55c84234e78f712de3c35cb7a6343c8ce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/HurwitzZeta/Variant3f368e6f7e98407e72f89bd546ad6bf55c84234e78f712de3c35cb7a6343c8ce.lean#L77).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `95f4daf1a029b54c880665a3d4d56efd3573a93c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
