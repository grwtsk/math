## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dc67448e-9b3f-ee54-869c-f347c64f3676`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 85–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem LSeriesSummable_of_sum_norm_bigO
    (hO : (fun n ↦ ∑ k ∈ Icc 1 n, ‖f k‖) =O[atTop] fun n ↦ (n : ℝ) ^ r)
    (hr : 0 ≤ r) (hs : r < s.re) :
    LSeriesSummable f s := by
  have h₁ : (fun n ↦ if n = 0 then 0 else f n) =ᶠ[atTop] f := by
    filter_upwards [eventually_ne_atTop 0] with n hn using by simp_rw [ite_eq_right hn]
  refine (LSeriesSummable_of_sum_norm_bigO_aux (ite_eq_left rfl) ?_ hr hs).congr' _ h₁
  refine hO.congr' (Eventually.of_forall fun _ ↦ Finset.sum_congr rfl fun _ h ↦ ?_) EventuallyEq.rfl
  rw [ite_eq_right (zero_lt_one.trans_le (mem_Icc.mp h).1).ne']

/-- If `f` takes nonnegative real values and the partial sums `∑ k ∈ Icc 1 n, f k` are `O(n ^ r)`
for some real `0 ≤ r`, then the L-series `LSeries f` converges at `s : ℂ` for all `s`
such that `r < s.re`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/SumCoeff/Variantd670906659ae88ccfcaee522ae97b1228f96bb912238ed1cc6ccc93662de9239.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/SumCoeff/Variantd670906659ae88ccfcaee522ae97b1228f96bb912238ed1cc6ccc93662de9239.lean#L85).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77831b43261b49090e61729c6bc3634b035327f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
