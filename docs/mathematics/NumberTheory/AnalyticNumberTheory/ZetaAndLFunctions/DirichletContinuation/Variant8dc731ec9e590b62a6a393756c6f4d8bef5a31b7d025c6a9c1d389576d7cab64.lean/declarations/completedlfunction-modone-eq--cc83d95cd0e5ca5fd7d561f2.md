## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ce7e04d3-8471-6826-fad4-30f6d7ca64d2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 235–246.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma completedLFunction_modOne_eq {χ : DirichletCharacter ℂ 1} :
    completedLFunction χ = completedRiemannZeta := by
  ext; rw [completedLFunction, ZMod.completedLFunction_modOne_eq, map_one, one_mul]

/--
The completed L-function of a Dirichlet character is differentiable, with the following
exceptions: at `s = 1` if `χ` is the trivial character (to any modulus); and at `s = 0` if the
modulus is 1. This result is best possible.

Note both `χ` and `s` are explicit arguments: we will always be able to infer one or other
of them from the hypotheses, but it's not clear which!

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/DirichletContinuation/Variant8dc731ec9e590b62a6a393756c6f4d8bef5a31b7d025c6a9c1d389576d7cab64.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/DirichletContinuation/Variant8dc731ec9e590b62a6a393756c6f4d8bef5a31b7d025c6a9c1d389576d7cab64.lean#L235).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b8f5c55347e64f60429f6a522419008fed860222` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
