## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:93d3180f-02c8-2fe7-0af7-bd3a283fff71`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 365–376.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    deriv (LFunctionTrivChar₁ n) s =

  have H : deriv (LFunctionTrivChar₁ n) s =
      deriv (fun w ↦ (w - 1) * LFunctionTrivChar n w) s := by

    deriv_id'', one_mul, add_comm]

/-- The negative logarithmic derivative of `s ↦ (s - 1) * L χ s` for a trivial
Dirichlet character `χ` is continuous away from the zeros of `L χ` (including at `s = 1`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/DirichletContinuation/Variant5184b2509792612380ec16b8a68cc088c7a647825729a5c42ae23f289bb57503.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/DirichletContinuation/Variant5184b2509792612380ec16b8a68cc088c7a647825729a5c42ae23f289bb57503.lean#L365).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fa988fadb21e31fc33d9b06a1f1d2711f31a4cda` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
