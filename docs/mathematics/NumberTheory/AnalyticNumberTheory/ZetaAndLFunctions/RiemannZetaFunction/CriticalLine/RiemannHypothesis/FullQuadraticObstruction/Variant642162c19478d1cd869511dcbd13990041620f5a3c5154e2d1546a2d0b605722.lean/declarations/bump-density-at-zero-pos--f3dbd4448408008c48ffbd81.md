## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f9cfcebe-aa6d-1336-c3e2-b6154b2df686`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 385–394.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem bump_density_at_zero_pos : 0 < JointPhaseScaling.bumpDensity 0 := by
  have he : sourceFourier sourceBump 0 = SourceBumpLaplace.bumpLaplace 0 := by
    rw [← SourceLaplaceDetection.bilateral_laplace_source_bump]
    simp [sourceFourier, SourceLaplaceDetection.bilateralLaplace]
  unfold JointPhaseScaling.bumpDensity
  rw [he]
  exact div_pos (Complex.normSq_pos.mpr SourceBumpLaplace.bump_laplace_zero_ne_zero)
    (by positivity)

/-- A fixed small scaled frequency interval retains a strictly positive amount of actual density. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/FullQuadraticObstruction/Variant642162c19478d1cd869511dcbd13990041620f5a3c5154e2d1546a2d0b605722.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/FullQuadraticObstruction/Variant642162c19478d1cd869511dcbd13990041620f5a3c5154e2d1546a2d0b605722.lean#L385).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4be62d5ae1a61061ba5c1a1892e7a16927b1fb0d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
