## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:86105cc1-dbdc-5b6e-6aa7-7478f139cb11`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 209–216.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem smallStep_value (ρ : Scale) (s : SmallCoordinate) :
    (smallStep ρ s).1 = (ρ.1 ^ 2)⁻¹ * s.1 := by
  change ((ρ.1 * Real.sqrt (s.1⁻¹)) ^ 2)⁻¹ = _
  rw [mul_pow, Real.sq_sqrt (inv_nonneg.mpr s.2.1.le), mul_inv_rev, inv_inv]
  exact mul_comm _ _

/-- Coherent chart comparison also intertwines this independently specified
physical evolution; its scalar arithmetic readouts are re-evaluated, not frozen. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/CertificationSourceScale/Variantfa71d6b19ac6f27d35455f918e8f450564d653da31d8dc3a61ffc312b4e03a77.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/CertificationSourceScale/Variantfa71d6b19ac6f27d35455f918e8f450564d653da31d8dc3a61ffc312b4e03a77.lean#L209).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6531f2aef68b834ece4222426bf000a58bf1e713` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
