## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1dcb4d27-0b9b-1965-c1f3-2754b60fbf2d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 137–144.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem literal_surplus_reconstruction {A : ℝ} (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    VaughanOperatorReview.covarianceOperatorValue A / 2 -
      SourceSamplingLedger.independentMainTerm A =
        remainingOverlapBalance A -
          (∫ v in actualWorkLeftStrip A, actualMixedWorkDensity A v) :=
  actual_surplus_eq_remainingOverlap_sub_strip hA

/-- The surviving obligation remains an actual eventual witness, not the boundary budget. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/RestrictedLowTimeWorkFixtures/Variant643fc78229c11a68b28d29c9d089ddfa6d869c7e66afce0068216091e2faed40.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/RestrictedLowTimeWorkFixtures/Variant643fc78229c11a68b28d29c9d089ddfa6d869c7e66afce0068216091e2faed40.lean#L137).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `22d6153fa580d88891d62493e44522cbb96dac27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
