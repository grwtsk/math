## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b919801d2c99f2b1e8bfd6a7b129d77b6b1bccff1c79ddbdaf04a33b4ea60656`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 33–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def squareEquiv : Scale ≃ Scale where
  toFun A := ⟨A.1 ^ 2, one_le_pow₀ A.2⟩
  invFun t := ⟨Real.sqrt t.1, Real.one_le_sqrt.mpr t.2⟩
  left_inv A := by
    apply Subtype.ext
    exact Real.sqrt_sq (zero_le_one.trans A.2)
  right_inv t := by
    apply Subtype.ext
    exact Real.sq_sqrt (zero_le_one.trans t.2)

/-- The two chart domains are related by reciprocal coordinates. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/CertificationSourceScale/Variantf1bc09c45a91f480c6e55fbf4535250ef99703c9013de68331da62cffeba2c17.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/CertificationSourceScale/Variantf1bc09c45a91f480c6e55fbf4535250ef99703c9013de68331da62cffeba2c17.lean#L33).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d85e2d96ea540ba1d78a1a8f37cc5a66fc0d83b5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
