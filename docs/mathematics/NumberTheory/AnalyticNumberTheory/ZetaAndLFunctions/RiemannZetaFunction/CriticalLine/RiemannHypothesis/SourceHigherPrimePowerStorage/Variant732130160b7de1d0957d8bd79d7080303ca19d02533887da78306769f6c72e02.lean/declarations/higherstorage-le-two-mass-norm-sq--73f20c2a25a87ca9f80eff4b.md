## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bc81d406-5f29-77c4-c529-fb4587803cb9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–62.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem higherStorage_le_two_mass_norm_sq (f : ComplexL2) :
    higherStorage f ≤ 2 * higherBaseline * ‖f‖ ^ 2 := by
  have h := (higherStorage_summable f).tsum_le_tsum
    (fun i => mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left
      (translationStorage_le_two_norm_sq _ _) (higherAtomWeight_nonneg i))
    (higherAtomWeight_summable.mul_right (2 * ‖f‖ ^ 2))
  rw [higherAtomWeight_summable.tsum_mul_right] at h
  change higherStorage f ≤ higherBaseline * (2 * ‖f‖ ^ 2) at h
  linarith

/-- The full signed real translation coefficient is also genuinely summable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/SourceHigherPrimePowerStorage/Variant732130160b7de1d0957d8bd79d7080303ca19d02533887da78306769f6c72e02.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/SourceHigherPrimePowerStorage/Variant732130160b7de1d0957d8bd79d7080303ca19d02533887da78306769f6c72e02.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `da884a0a6777106064e259188e484450c8593e92` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
