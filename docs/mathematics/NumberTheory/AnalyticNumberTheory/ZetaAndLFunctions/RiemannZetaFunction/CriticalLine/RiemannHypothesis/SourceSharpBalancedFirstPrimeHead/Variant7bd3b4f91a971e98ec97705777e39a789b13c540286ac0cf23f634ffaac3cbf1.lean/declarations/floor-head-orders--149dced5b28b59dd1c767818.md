## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0141df7d-87e0-8b0c-c2de-c4e7563211a5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 27–38.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem floor_head_orders {A : ℝ} (hA : 91 ≤ A) :
    Real.log 7 ≤ Real.log (⌊A^2⌋₊ : ℝ) ∧
    Real.log (⌊A^2⌋₊ : ℝ) ≤ 2 * Real.log A := by
  have hp : 0 < A := by linarith
  have hU : 7 ≤ ⌊A^2⌋₊ := Nat.le_floor (by nlinarith : (7 : ℝ) ≤ A^2)
  have hUr : (7 : ℝ) ≤ (⌊A^2⌋₊ : ℝ) := by exact_mod_cast hU
  have hlog := Real.log_le_log (by linarith : 0 < (⌊A^2⌋₊ : ℝ))
    (Nat.floor_le (sq_nonneg A))
  rw [Real.log_pow] at hlog
  exact ⟨Real.log_le_log (by norm_num) hUr, by simpa using hlog⟩

/-- The original actual floor head retains its full lower-seven subtraction. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/SourceSharpBalancedFirstPrimeHead/Variant7bd3b4f91a971e98ec97705777e39a789b13c540286ac0cf23f634ffaac3cbf1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/SourceSharpBalancedFirstPrimeHead/Variant7bd3b4f91a971e98ec97705777e39a789b13c540286ac0cf23f634ffaac3cbf1.lean#L27).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c35699b1c772bb1adeab805c4c5aaf9800337aad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
