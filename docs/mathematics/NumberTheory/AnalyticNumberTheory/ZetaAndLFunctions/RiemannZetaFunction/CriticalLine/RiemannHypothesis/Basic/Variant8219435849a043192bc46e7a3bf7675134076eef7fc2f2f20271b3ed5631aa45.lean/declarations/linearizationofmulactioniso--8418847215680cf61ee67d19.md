## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d8ed76cd8c3c12fcc3fcc11040ef484ce94b2114579b0ceea1e55186d881beb2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1038–1043.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev linearizationOfMulActionIso (H : Type u) [MulAction G H] :
    (linearization k G).obj (Action.ofMulAction G H) ≅ ofMulAction k G H :=
  Rep.mkIso (Representation.linearizeOfMulActionIso k G H)

/-- Given a `k`-linear `G`-representation `A`, there is a `k`-linear isomorphism between
representation morphisms `Hom(k[G], A)` and `A`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Basic/Variant8219435849a043192bc46e7a3bf7675134076eef7fc2f2f20271b3ed5631aa45.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Basic/Variant8219435849a043192bc46e7a3bf7675134076eef7fc2f2f20271b3ed5631aa45.lean#L1038).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f305c8e3426e8512d3ab6b9cf6cbcfc3f9385854` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
