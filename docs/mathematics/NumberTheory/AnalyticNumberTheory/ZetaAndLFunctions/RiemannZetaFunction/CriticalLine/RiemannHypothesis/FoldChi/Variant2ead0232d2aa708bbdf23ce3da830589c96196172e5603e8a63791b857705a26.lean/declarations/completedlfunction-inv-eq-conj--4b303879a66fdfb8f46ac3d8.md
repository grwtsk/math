## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e2e0898e-a5ed-31e9-24f8-5cbd353f3615`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–112.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean

    completedLFunction χ⁻¹ w = conj (completedLFunction χ (conj w)) := by
  have hA : AnalyticOnNhd ℂ (completedLFunction χ⁻¹) univ := fun z _ =>
    (differentiable_completedLFunction (inv_ne_one hχ1)).analyticAt z
  have hB : AnalyticOnNhd ℂ (fun z => conj (completedLFunction χ (conj z))) univ := by
    refine DifferentiableOn.analyticOnNhd (fun z _ => ?_) isOpen_univ
    have hd : DifferentiableAt ℂ (completedLFunction χ) (conj z) :=
      (differentiable_completedLFunction hχ1) _
    have h3 := hd.conj_conj
    rw [Complex.conj_conj] at h3

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/FoldChi/Variant2ead0232d2aa708bbdf23ce3da830589c96196172e5603e8a63791b857705a26.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/FoldChi/Variant2ead0232d2aa708bbdf23ce3da830589c96196172e5603e8a63791b857705a26.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `84c70d1e4b5f80d1277d1af74612d069d085396a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
