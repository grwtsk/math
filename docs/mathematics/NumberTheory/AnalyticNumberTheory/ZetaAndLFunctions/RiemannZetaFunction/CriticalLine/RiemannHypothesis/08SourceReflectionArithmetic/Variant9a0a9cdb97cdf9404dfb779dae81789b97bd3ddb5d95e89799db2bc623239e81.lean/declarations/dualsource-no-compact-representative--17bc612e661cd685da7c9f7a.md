## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9725b0d8-94be-f1c3-2a8d-ab8f3042459e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 502–508.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dualSource_no_compact_representative (A : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    ¬ ∃ g : ℝ → ℂ, HasCompactSupport g ∧
      (dualSourceL2 A (by linarith) : ℝ → ℂ) =ᵐ[volume] g :=
  SourceDualSupport.angular_dual_no_compact_representative A hA
    (sourceL2 A (by linarith)) (sourceL2_coe_ae A (by linarith))

/-- Literal real profiles have conjugation-fixed complex L² embeddings. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/08SourceReflectionArithmetic/Variant9a0a9cdb97cdf9404dfb779dae81789b97bd3ddb5d95e89799db2bc623239e81.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/08SourceReflectionArithmetic/Variant9a0a9cdb97cdf9404dfb779dae81789b97bd3ddb5d95e89799db2bc623239e81.lean#L502).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2cceee931fcb448ad8a927e1a757728e5aa3b1ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
