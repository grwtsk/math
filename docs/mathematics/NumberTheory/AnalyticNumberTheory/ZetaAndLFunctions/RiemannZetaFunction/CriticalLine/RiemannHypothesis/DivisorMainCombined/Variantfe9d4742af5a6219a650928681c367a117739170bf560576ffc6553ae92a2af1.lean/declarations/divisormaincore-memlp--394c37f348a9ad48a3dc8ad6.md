## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8b2ab749-d168-08cc-04f5-1fc57908596a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 181–188.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem divisorMainCore_memLp (X : ℕ) (ε : ℝ) (hX : 1 ≤ X) (hε : 0 ≤ ε)
    (Y : ℝ) (hY : 1 ≤ Y) : MemLp (divisorMainCore X ε Y) 2 volume := by
  rw [mainCore_eq_add X ε hX Y]
  exact ((logResidual_memLp X ε hX).indicator measurableSet_Icc).add
    (divisorRemainderCore_memLp ε hε Y hY)

/-- The actual L2 vector represented by the fully expanded arithmetic main term
on the closed core. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/DivisorMainCombined/Variantfe9d4742af5a6219a650928681c367a117739170bf560576ffc6553ae92a2af1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/DivisorMainCombined/Variantfe9d4742af5a6219a650928681c367a117739170bf560576ffc6553ae92a2af1.lean#L181).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `67fc0bfbf328f9d95687308c267a155835c8dbb3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
