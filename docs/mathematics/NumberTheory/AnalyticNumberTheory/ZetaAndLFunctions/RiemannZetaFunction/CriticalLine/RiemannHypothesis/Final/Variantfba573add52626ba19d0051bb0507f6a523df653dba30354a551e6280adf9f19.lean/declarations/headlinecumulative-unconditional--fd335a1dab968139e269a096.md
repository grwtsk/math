## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4242915d-e664-975c-55d9-09c88a9ba7b8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 271–286.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-! ## The same proportions against the zeta zero count N(T,2T)  ([XF′ (F3)]: N_{ξ′}(T) = N(T) + O(log T))

Both configurations obey Riemann–von Mangoldt with the same main term (T/2π)ℓ₁ (ξ′: xiDerivZeros₀_rvm; ζ:
Zeta23.RvM.riemannVonMangoldt Zeta23.gammaFacts), so N_{ξ′}(T,2T) ≥ (1−δ)N_ζ(T,2T) eventually for every δ > 0, and the strict
certificate margin absorbs the δ.  N_ζ = Zeta23.Ncount = the nontrivial zeros of Mathlib's riemannZeta in T < Im ≤ 2T

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Final/Variantfba573add52626ba19d0051bb0507f6a523df653dba30354a551e6280adf9f19.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Final/Variantfba573add52626ba19d0051bb0507f6a523df653dba30354a551e6280adf9f19.lean#L271).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `78c32ce3fb65e3ec681a110d62a62c1070edd465` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
