## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0d70def2-4931-8c70-423b-755411026ba4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 239–248.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem PaperInputs.of_EF (hEF : EF.EF_lit zetaZeroConfig) : PaperInputs zetaZeroConfig :=

/-- **Theorem A** [thm:A], single hypothesis — Weil's explicit formula for ζ in literature form
[eq:EFstd] is the ONLY assumption: for every ε > 0 and all large T, at least (2/3 − ε) of the
nontrivial zeros of ζ in (T, 2T], counted with multiplicity, are matched by distinct zeros ON the
critical line:  (2/3 − ε)·N(T,2T) ≤ N₀*(T,2T). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Final/Variant46ffcd80ca80b3d5021c08b9829ac1c03a371fee7cecbbc9eeb76fcc1fb1cae6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Final/Variant46ffcd80ca80b3d5021c08b9829ac1c03a371fee7cecbbc9eeb76fcc1fb1cae6.lean#L239).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7d1309e6d3bbc3e3f3c6b093f07af257dbe40b82` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
