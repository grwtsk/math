## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:818ee421-19c7-f28a-6f22-1feb05d1e323`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 176–188.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cutoffs_eventually_eq {A : ℝ}
    (hU : (vaughanCutoff A : ℝ) < A ^ 2)
    (hN : (sourceKernelCutoff A : ℝ) < Real.exp (2 * A)) :
    ∀ᶠ B in nhds A,
      vaughanCutoff B = vaughanCutoff A ∧ sourceKernelCutoff B = sourceKernelCutoff A := by
  have hu := SourceScaleVariation.floor_eventually_eq_of_strict_lower
    (f := fun B : ℝ => B ^ 2) (by fun_prop) hU
  have hn := SourceScaleVariation.floor_eventually_eq_of_strict_lower
    (f := fun B : ℝ => Real.exp (2 * B)) (by fun_prop) hN
  filter_upwards [hu, hn] with B hB hB'
  exact ⟨hB, hB'⟩

/-- Between actual cutoff events the complete forward arithmetic state has C¹ source variation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/SourceDivisorCounterterms/Variant595f67f29f9e6f7bc5f3aadd1a855f892f02475241d6f1b943f00bbf9e6e86f7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/SourceDivisorCounterterms/Variant595f67f29f9e6f7bc5f3aadd1a855f892f02475241d6f1b943f00bbf9e6e86f7.lean#L176).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `099a956ebe2367ba758c456bdd16201b39becd8c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
