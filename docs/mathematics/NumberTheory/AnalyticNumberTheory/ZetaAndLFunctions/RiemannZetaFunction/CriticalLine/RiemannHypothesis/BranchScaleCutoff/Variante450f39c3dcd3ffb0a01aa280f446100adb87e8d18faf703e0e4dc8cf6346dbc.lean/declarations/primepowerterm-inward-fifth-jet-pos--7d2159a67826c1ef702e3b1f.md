## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e04db3bd-032a-a9ea-2c81-d9d3cf816686`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 224–239.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem primePowerTerm_inward_fifth_jet_pos {n : ℕ} (hn : IsPrimePow n) :
    0 < iteratedDerivWithin 5 (primePowerTerm n)
      (Icc (Real.log n / 2) (Real.log n)) (Real.log n / 2) := by
  rw [primePowerTerm_inward_fifth_jet hn]
  have hn2 := hn.two_le
  have hn1 : (1 : ℝ) < n := by exact_mod_cast (by omega : 1 < n)
  have ha : 0 < Real.log (n : ℝ) / 2 := div_pos (Real.log_pos hn1) (by norm_num)
  have hz : 0 < sourceNormalization (Real.log n / 2) := by
    unfold sourceNormalization
    positivity
  have hw : 0 < ArithmeticFunction.vonMangoldt n / Real.sqrt n :=
    div_pos (ArithmeticFunction.vonMangoldt_pos_iff.mpr hn)
      (Real.sqrt_pos.mpr (by linarith : (0 : ℝ) < n))
  positivity

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/BranchScaleCutoff/Variante450f39c3dcd3ffb0a01aa280f446100adb87e8d18faf703e0e4dc8cf6346dbc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/BranchScaleCutoff/Variante450f39c3dcd3ffb0a01aa280f446100adb87e8d18faf703e0e4dc8cf6346dbc.lean#L224).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `857cbf477d72101af3a07798674c58f93478c66d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
