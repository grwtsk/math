## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3db9be86-3731-f720-eac0-929737d6b1df`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 228–238.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem source_flux_decoder (A : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) {E : Type*} [Fintype E]
    (tail head : E → SourceVertex A) (flux : E → ℝ) :
    (∑ v : SourceVertex A, sourceGainObservable A v *
      (sourcePayload A v + PacketTransportCertificates.divergence tail head flux v)) -
        (∑ e, (sourceGainObservable A (head e) - sourceGainObservable A (tail e)) * flux e) =
      -2 * mertensResidual A := by
  rw [PacketTransportCertificates.decoded_transported_readout]
  exact sourcePayload_readout A hA

/-- The same gains retain the continuous and every higher-power component
when decoded through the literal signed Abel route. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/SourceFiniteGameBridge/Variant22113427df4827a08041db59de48aa65d3a94cfc456d41a361ce654ef9b25c78.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/SourceFiniteGameBridge/Variant22113427df4827a08041db59de48aa65d3a94cfc456d41a361ce654ef9b25c78.lean#L228).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1e618b228797a1eac334ad20325af07240711800` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
