## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0a835627-67ce-02bf-837b-68b320e0cbd5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 69–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dualWeightRun_threshold {a b : ℚ} (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) :
    ∃ k : ℕ, ∀ labels : List Bool, labels.length = k →
      1 < (dualWeightRun labels a b).1 * (dualWeightRun labels a b).2 := by
  obtain ⟨k, hk⟩ := exists_pow_lt_of_lt_one (mul_pos ha hb)
    (by norm_num : (25 / 32 : ℚ) < 1)
  refine ⟨k, fun labels hlength => ?_⟩
  rw [dualWeightRun_product, hlength]
  have hm := mul_lt_mul_of_pos_left hk (pow_pos (by norm_num : (0 : ℚ) < 32 / 25) k)
  have hp : (32 / 25 : ℚ) ^ k * (25 / 32 : ℚ) ^ k = 1 := by
    rw [← mul_pow]
    norm_num
  rwa [hp] at hm

/-- A support's favorable labels receive `4/5`; its other labels receive `8/5`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/FiniteGameSearchWeights/Variant0070d8eb79273d5fe4fb1897d9f6eb4e3d0058acb0c6eb117bd6ebb2a19b7b21.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/FiniteGameSearchWeights/Variant0070d8eb79273d5fe4fb1897d9f6eb4e3d0058acb0c6eb117bd6ebb2a19b7b21.lean#L69).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0fab8d17f5ec2a76f59463f044a9afbfa9ce95ed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
