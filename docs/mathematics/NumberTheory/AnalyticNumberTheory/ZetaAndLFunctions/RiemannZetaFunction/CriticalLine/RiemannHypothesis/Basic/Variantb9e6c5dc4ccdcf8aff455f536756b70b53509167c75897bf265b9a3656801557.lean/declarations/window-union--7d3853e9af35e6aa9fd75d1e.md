## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:43c7451f-fd0b-4799-aefd-8fb2c85ecefc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 35–47.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma window_union {a b c : ℝ} (h1 : a ≤ b) (h2 : b ≤ c) :
    Z.window a c = Z.window a b ∪ Z.window b c := by
  ext ρ
  simp only [ZeroConfig.window, mem_inter_iff, mem_setOf_eq, mem_union]
  constructor
  · rintro ⟨hρ, ha, hc⟩
    rcases le_or_gt ρ.im b with hle | hgt
    · exact Or.inl ⟨hρ, ha, hle⟩
    · exact Or.inr ⟨hρ, hgt, hc⟩
  · rintro (⟨hρ, ha, hb⟩ | ⟨hρ, hb, hc⟩)
    · exact ⟨hρ, ha, le_trans hb h2⟩
    · exact ⟨hρ, lt_of_le_of_lt h1 hb, hc⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Basic/Variantb9e6c5dc4ccdcf8aff455f536756b70b53509167c75897bf265b9a3656801557.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Basic/Variantb9e6c5dc4ccdcf8aff455f536756b70b53509167c75897bf265b9a3656801557.lean#L35).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a3a9c3d59ca18209ec683669224554e2f2b020ae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
