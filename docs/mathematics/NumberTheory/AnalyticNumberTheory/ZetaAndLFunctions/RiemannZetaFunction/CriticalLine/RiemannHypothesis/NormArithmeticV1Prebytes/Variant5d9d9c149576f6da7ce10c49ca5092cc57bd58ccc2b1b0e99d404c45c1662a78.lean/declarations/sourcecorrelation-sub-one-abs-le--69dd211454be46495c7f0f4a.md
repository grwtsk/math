## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:507ad720-a074-7ba8-46fe-35b8b02c46bc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 70–84.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  have hp : 0 < R := by linarith
  have hd := (sourceCorrelation_contDiff R hp).differentiable (by norm_num)
  have h := (convex_univ : Convex ℝ (univ : Set ℝ)).norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_deriv_le
    (f := sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative R) (x := 0) (y := s)
    (fun x _ => hd x)
    (fun x _ => by simpa only [Real.norm_eq_abs] using
      sourceCorrelation_deriv_abs_le_five_div hR x) (by trivial) (by trivial)
  calc
    _ ≤ (5 / R) * |s| := by
      simpa only [Real.norm_eq_abs, sourceCorrelation_zero hp, sub_zero] using h
    _ = _ := by ring

/-- The actual source correlation tends to one at a fixed separation as radius grows. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/NormArithmeticV1Prebytes/Variant5d9d9c149576f6da7ce10c49ca5092cc57bd58ccc2b1b0e99d404c45c1662a78.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/NormArithmeticV1Prebytes/Variant5d9d9c149576f6da7ce10c49ca5092cc57bd58ccc2b1b0e99d404c45c1662a78.lean#L70).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9d58848e723bc15a46cca7704082ffa342a4fe70` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
