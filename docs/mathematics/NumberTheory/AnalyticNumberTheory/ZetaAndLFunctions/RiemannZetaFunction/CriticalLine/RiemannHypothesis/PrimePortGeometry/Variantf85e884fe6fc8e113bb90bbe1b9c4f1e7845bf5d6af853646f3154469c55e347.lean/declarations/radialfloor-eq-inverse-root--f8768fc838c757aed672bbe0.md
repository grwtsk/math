## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5e5c4733-54b0-c045-3a4c-3896d9c2b614`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 46–50.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem radialFloor_eq_inverse_root : radialFloor = (Real.sqrt 3)⁻¹ := by
  have hs := Real.sqrt_sq radialFloor_positive.le
  rw [radialFloor_sq, Real.sqrt_div (by norm_num), Real.sqrt_one] at hs
  simpa [one_div] using hs.symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/PrimePortGeometry/Variantf85e884fe6fc8e113bb90bbe1b9c4f1e7845bf5d6af853646f3154469c55e347.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/PrimePortGeometry/Variantf85e884fe6fc8e113bb90bbe1b9c4f1e7845bf5d6af853646f3154469c55e347.lean#L46).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
