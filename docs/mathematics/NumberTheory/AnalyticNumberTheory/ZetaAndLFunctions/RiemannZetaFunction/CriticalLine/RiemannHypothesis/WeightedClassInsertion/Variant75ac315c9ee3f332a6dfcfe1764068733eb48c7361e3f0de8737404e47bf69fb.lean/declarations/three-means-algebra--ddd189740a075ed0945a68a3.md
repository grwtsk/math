## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bcc16614-ba5a-09da-98b8-edc23e71dbf2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 63–70.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem three_means_algebra (m a b c k K L R : ℝ) :
    m * a * K - m * b * L - m * c * R - k * (m * a * K) =
      m * ((a - (Real.sqrt 2 / 2) * (b + c) - k * a) * K +
        (Real.sqrt 2 / 2) * b * (K - Real.sqrt 2 * L) +
        (Real.sqrt 2 / 2) * c * (K - Real.sqrt 2 * R)) := by
  have hs := Real.sq_sqrt (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) ≤ 2)
  linear_combination (m * b * L / 2 + m * c * R / 2) * hs

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/WeightedClassInsertion/Variant75ac315c9ee3f332a6dfcfe1764068733eb48c7361e3f0de8737404e47bf69fb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/WeightedClassInsertion/Variant75ac315c9ee3f332a6dfcfe1764068733eb48c7361e3f0de8737404e47bf69fb.lean#L63).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b5f80b70b49af1316f76b49a6cbfba65fdc5def4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
