## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3b3261dc-27b9-0d80-3983-f555d5417bc4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma continuousAt_logDeriv_completedZeta {s : ℂ} (him : 1 ≤ s.im) (hgood : GoodHeight s.im) :
    ContinuousAt (logDeriv completedRiemannZeta) s := by
  have hs0 : s ≠ 0 := by intro hh; rw [hh] at him; simp at him; linarith
  have hs1 : s ≠ 1 := by intro hh; rw [hh] at him; simp at him; linarith
  have hΛ := analyticAt_completedRiemannZeta hs0 hs1
  have hne : completedRiemannZeta s ≠ 0 := fun h =>
    hgood s (completedRiemannZeta_eq_zero_iff.mp h) rfl
  exact hΛ.deriv.continuousAt.div hΛ.continuousAt hne

/-- Horizontal fold at a good height T ≥ 1:  ∫_{−1}^{2} F(σ+iT)dσ = 2i·Im ∫_{1/2}^{2} F(σ+iT)dσ. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Fold/Variant8718829b64d244df1f27b737d5776901bca0d39b36a6fe9982cc3f467de49e25.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Fold/Variant8718829b64d244df1f27b737d5776901bca0d39b36a6fe9982cc3f467de49e25.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ed874bd9cb2a69f95ecb6b37abad38bb8a7812f0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
