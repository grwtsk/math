## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:35471288-7aa3-fc72-b42f-6f1c7165b721`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 45–65.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem le_closingBound_of_sqrt_inequality {K C₀ C₁ : ℝ}
    (hK : 0 ≤ K) (hC₀ : 0 ≤ C₀) (hC₁ : 0 ≤ C₁)
    (hclose : K ≤ C₀ + C₁ * Real.sqrt K) :
    K ≤ closingBound C₀ C₁ := by
  have hx := Real.sqrt_nonneg K
  have hx₂ := Real.sq_sqrt hK
  have hr := closingRoot_nonneg (C₀ := C₀) hC₁
  have hr₁ := closingRoot_ge_coefficient hC₀ hC₁
  have hr₂ := closingRoot_equation (C₁ := C₁) hC₀
  have hxr : Real.sqrt K ≤ closingRoot C₀ C₁ := by

    have hlt := lt_of_not_ge h
    have hp : 0 < (Real.sqrt K - closingRoot C₀ C₁) *

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/KQHBootstrap/Variant3085bd2efd4072e2dcef85d9756a138dbf02f6c139c40eefc5b908daa5201e3b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/KQHBootstrap/Variant3085bd2efd4072e2dcef85d9756a138dbf02f6c139c40eefc5b908daa5201e3b.lean#L45).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a5c2548cdd66e09bcb4632267ab1d9bbdb10f7fd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
