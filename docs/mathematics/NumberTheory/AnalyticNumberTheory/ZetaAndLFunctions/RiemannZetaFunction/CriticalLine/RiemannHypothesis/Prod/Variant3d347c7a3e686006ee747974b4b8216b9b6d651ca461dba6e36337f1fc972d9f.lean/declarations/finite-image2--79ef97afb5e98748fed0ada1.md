## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a36635006c8270745819cc1088722cd89346f6c664b8228c9b61cca4220f58f8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 134–158.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance finite_image2 (f : α → β → γ) (s : Set α) (t : Set β) [Finite s] [Finite t] :
    Finite (image2 f s t : Set γ) := by
  rw [← image_prod]
  infer_instance

end Finite.Set

namespace Set

/-! ### Constructors for `Set.Finite`

Every constructor here should have a corresponding `Fintype` instance in the previous section
(or in the `Fintype` module).

The implementation of these constructors ideally should be no more than `Set.toFinite`,
after possibly setting up some `Fintype` and classical `Decidable` instances.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Prod/Variant3d347c7a3e686006ee747974b4b8216b9b6d651ca461dba6e36337f1fc972d9f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Prod/Variant3d347c7a3e686006ee747974b4b8216b9b6d651ca461dba6e36337f1fc972d9f.lean#L134).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5f9a679b7365b5247a3e1f83cb911f992154a044` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
