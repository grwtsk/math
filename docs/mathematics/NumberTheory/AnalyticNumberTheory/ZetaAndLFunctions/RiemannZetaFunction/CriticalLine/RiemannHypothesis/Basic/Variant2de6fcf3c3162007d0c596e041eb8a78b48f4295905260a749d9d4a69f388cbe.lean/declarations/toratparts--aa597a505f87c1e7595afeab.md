## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c34011e30364f2d4b23aaedef68205eda3e0ec4eb795ad403dc36d0b5bb04319`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 20–34.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toRatParts (f : Float) : Option (Int × Int) :=
  if f.isFinite then
    let (f', exp) := f.frExp
    let x := (2^53:Nat).toFloat * f'
    let v := if x < 0 then
      (-(-x).floor.toUInt64.toNat : Int)
    else
      (x.floor.toUInt64.toNat : Int)
    some (v, exp - 53)
  else none

/-- Returns `v, exp` integers such that `f = v * 2^exp`.
Like `toRatParts`, but `e` is guaranteed to be minimal (`v` is always odd), unless `v = 0`.
`v.abs` will be at most `2^53 - 1` because `Float` has 53 bits of precision.
Returns `none` when `f` is not finite (i.e. `inf`, `-inf` or a `nan`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Basic/Variant2de6fcf3c3162007d0c596e041eb8a78b48f4295905260a749d9d4a69f388cbe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Basic/Variant2de6fcf3c3162007d0c596e041eb8a78b48f4295905260a749d9d4a69f388cbe.lean#L20).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `906fe5e25bcb1eb615ad8fd571acf8d1aee59e02` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
