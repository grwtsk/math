## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5c8095f0a68dc43f6a25e4134f1bc67e04ebb1676394372e06785b8f865dd89c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 201–226.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[env_linter] def unusedHavesSuffices : Linter where
  noErrorsFound := "No declarations have unused term mode have statements."
  errorsFound := "THE FOLLOWING DECLARATIONS HAVE INEFFECTUAL TERM MODE HAVE/SUFFICES BLOCKS. \
    In the case of `have` this is a term of the form `have h := foo, bar` where `bar` does not \
    refer to `foo`. Such statements have no effect on the generated proof, and can just be \
    replaced by `bar`, in addition to being ineffectual, they may make unnecessary assumptions \
    in proofs appear as if they are used. \
    For `suffices` this is a term of the form `suffices h : foo, proof_of_goal, proof_of_foo` \
    where `proof_of_goal` does not refer to `foo`. \
    Such statements have no effect on the generated proof, and can just be replaced by \
    `proof_of_goal`, in addition to being ineffectual, they may make unnecessary assumptions \
    in proofs appear as if they are used."
  test declName := do
    if ← isAutoDecl declName then return none
    let info ← getConstInfo declName
    let mut unused ← findUnusedHaves info.type
    if let some value := info.value? then
      unused := unused ++ (← findUnusedHaves value)
    unless unused.isEmpty do
      return some <| .joinSep unused.toList ", "
    return none

A linter for checking if variables appearing on both sides of an iff are explicit. Ideally, such
variables should be implicit instead.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Misc/Variant82951a40671bdbb973b090ff49eff8f23319d1c9a556542830d3f04309d4a3fa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Misc/Variant82951a40671bdbb973b090ff49eff8f23319d1c9a556542830d3f04309d4a3fa.lean#L201).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7625b7da3572857d451b69049ad1e52225d03b34` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
