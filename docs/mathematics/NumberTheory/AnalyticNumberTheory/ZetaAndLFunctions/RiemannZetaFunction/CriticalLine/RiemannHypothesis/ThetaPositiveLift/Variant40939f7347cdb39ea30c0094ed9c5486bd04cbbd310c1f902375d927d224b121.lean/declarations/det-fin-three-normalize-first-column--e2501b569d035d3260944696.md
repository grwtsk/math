## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0b98a69c-78ab-783a-eb86-8946f7ac24c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 290–301.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem det_fin_three_normalize_first_column
    (M : Matrix (Fin 3) (Fin 3) ℝ) (h0 : ∀ i, M i 0 ≠ 0) :
    M.det =
      (M 0 0 * M 1 0 * M 2 0) *
        Matrix.det !![1, 1, 1;
          M 0 1 / M 0 0, M 1 1 / M 1 0, M 2 1 / M 2 0;
          M 0 2 / M 0 0, M 1 2 / M 1 0, M 2 2 / M 2 0] := by
  simp [Matrix.det_fin_three]
  field_simp [h0 0, h0 1, h0 2]

/-- Arbitrary increasing theta-tail orders have the rank-three source orientation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/ThetaPositiveLift/Variant40939f7347cdb39ea30c0094ed9c5486bd04cbbd310c1f902375d927d224b121.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/ThetaPositiveLift/Variant40939f7347cdb39ea30c0094ed9c5486bd04cbbd310c1f902375d927d224b121.lean#L290).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c15fd99f5fd87392ea876afdbc065cba83ab20d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
