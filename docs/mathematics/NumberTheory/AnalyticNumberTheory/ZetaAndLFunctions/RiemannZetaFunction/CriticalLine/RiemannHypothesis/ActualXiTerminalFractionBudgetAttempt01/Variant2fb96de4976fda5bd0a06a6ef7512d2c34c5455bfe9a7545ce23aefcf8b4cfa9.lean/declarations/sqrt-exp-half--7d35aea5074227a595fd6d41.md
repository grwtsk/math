## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a8b6c887-2440-08c0-c6e4-9a845e77789c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 83–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem sqrt_exp_half (t : ℝ) : Real.sqrt (Real.exp t) = Real.exp (t / 2) := by
  have hs := Real.sq_sqrt (Real.exp_pos t).le
  have he : (Real.exp (t / 2)) ^ 2 = Real.exp t := by
    rw [pow_two, ← Real.exp_add]
    congr 1
    ring
  nlinarith [Real.exp_pos (t / 2), Real.sqrt_nonneg (Real.exp t)]

/-- The floor-dependent actual terminal cell decays along every real time. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/ActualXiTerminalFractionBudgetAttempt01/Variant2fb96de4976fda5bd0a06a6ef7512d2c34c5455bfe9a7545ce23aefcf8b4cfa9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/ActualXiTerminalFractionBudgetAttempt01/Variant2fb96de4976fda5bd0a06a6ef7512d2c34c5455bfe9a7545ce23aefcf8b4cfa9.lean#L83).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9951892176f2690168242a5f88a11a8a3a722890` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
