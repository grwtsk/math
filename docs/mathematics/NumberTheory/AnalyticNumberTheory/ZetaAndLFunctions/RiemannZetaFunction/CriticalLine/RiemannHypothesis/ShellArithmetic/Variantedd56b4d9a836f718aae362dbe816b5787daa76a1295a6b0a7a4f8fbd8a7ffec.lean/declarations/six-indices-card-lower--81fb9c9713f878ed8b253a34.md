## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:75e71d7c-fd9b-6eff-3969-4ba11dca4b9e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 41–48.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem six_indices_card_lower {lo hi : ℝ} (hlo : 0 ≤ lo) (hlen : 12 ≤ hi - lo) :
    (hi - lo) / 12 ≤ ((sixIndices lo hi).card : ℝ) := by
  have hmono : ⌊lo / 6⌋₊ ≤ ⌊hi / 6⌋₊ := Nat.floor_mono (by linarith)
  have hL := Nat.floor_le (by linarith : 0 ≤ lo / 6)
  have hU := Nat.lt_floor_add_one (hi / 6)
  simp only [sixIndices, Nat.card_Ioc, Nat.cast_sub hmono]
  linarith

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/ShellArithmetic/Variantedd56b4d9a836f718aae362dbe816b5787daa76a1295a6b0a7a4f8fbd8a7ffec.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/ShellArithmetic/Variantedd56b4d9a836f718aae362dbe816b5787daa76a1295a6b0a7a4f8fbd8a7ffec.lean#L41).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e220b5c43689053096efe141bae6d1de8238d9fe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
