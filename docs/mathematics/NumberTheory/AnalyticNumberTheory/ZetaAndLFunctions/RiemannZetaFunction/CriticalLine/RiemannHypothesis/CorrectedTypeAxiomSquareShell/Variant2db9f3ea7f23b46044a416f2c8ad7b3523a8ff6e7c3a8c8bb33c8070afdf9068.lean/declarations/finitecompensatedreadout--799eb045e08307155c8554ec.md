## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d8b2f0655add77889a511a58a0a1ca96034cfff2715f0b4abe7095e86dd43458`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 45–49.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def finiteCompensatedReadout (A : ℝ) (N : ℕ) : ℝ :=
  ∑ n ∈ Finset.Icc 2 N, (ArithmeticFunction.vonMangoldt n - 1) / Real.sqrt n *
    sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A (Real.log n)

/-- The all-natural baseline with exactly the same closed inventory. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/CorrectedTypeAxiomSquareShell/Variant2db9f3ea7f23b46044a416f2c8ad7b3523a8ff6e7c3a8c8bb33c8070afdf9068.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/CorrectedTypeAxiomSquareShell/Variant2db9f3ea7f23b46044a416f2c8ad7b3523a8ff6e7c3a8c8bb33c8070afdf9068.lean#L45).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
