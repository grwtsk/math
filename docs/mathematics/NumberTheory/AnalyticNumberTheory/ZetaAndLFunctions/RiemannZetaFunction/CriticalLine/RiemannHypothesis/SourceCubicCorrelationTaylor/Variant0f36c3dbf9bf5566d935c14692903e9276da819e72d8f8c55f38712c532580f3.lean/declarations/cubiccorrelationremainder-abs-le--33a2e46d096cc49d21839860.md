## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6c9ca1b6-cd69-c1a8-a0eb-de9cad30c274`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 65–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    |cubicCorrelationRemainder A a y| ≤ 67 / A ^ 4 * y ^ 4 / 24 := by
  have h := global_taylor_bound 3
    (actual_correlation_contDiff_four A (by linarith)) (67 / A ^ 4) a y
    (fun t => actual_correlation_iterated_fourth_abs_le_sixty_seven A t hA)
  have he : taylorWithinEval (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A) 3 univ a (a + y) =
      cubicCorrelationJet A a y := by
    simp [taylorWithinEval_succ, taylor_within_zero_eval, iteratedDeriv_succ,
      iteratedDeriv_zero, cubicCorrelationJet]
    <;> ring
  rw [he] at h
  have hy4 : |y| ^ 4 = y ^ 4 := by
    rw [show (4 : ℕ) = 2 * 2 from rfl, pow_mul, pow_mul, sq_abs]
  norm_num only [Nat.reduceAdd, Nat.factorial, Nat.cast_ofNat] at h
  simpa only [cubicCorrelationRemainder, hy4] using h

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/SourceCubicCorrelationTaylor/Variant0f36c3dbf9bf5566d935c14692903e9276da819e72d8f8c55f38712c532580f3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/SourceCubicCorrelationTaylor/Variant0f36c3dbf9bf5566d935c14692903e9276da819e72d8f8c55f38712c532580f3.lean#L65).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
