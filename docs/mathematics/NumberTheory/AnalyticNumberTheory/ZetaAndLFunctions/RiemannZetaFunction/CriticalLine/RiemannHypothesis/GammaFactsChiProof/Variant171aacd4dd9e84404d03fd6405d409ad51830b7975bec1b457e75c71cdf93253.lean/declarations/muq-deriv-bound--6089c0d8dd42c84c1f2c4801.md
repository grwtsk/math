## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:60ae0e63-2904-ffeb-16fb-398ac00676bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 360–366.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem muq_deriv_bound (hκ : κ ≤ 1) : ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ τ : ℝ, 1 ≤ |τ| → |deriv (muq κ q) τ| ≤ C / |τ| :=
  ⟨24 / Real.pi, muq_deriv_bound_const hκ⟩

/-! ### The bundle -/

/-- H-Γ(χ) from the two integral fields (supplied by Zeta23/ThmE/IntMuChi.lean from
`muq_stirling` + continuity by the FTC computations with log(qτ/2π)). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/GammaFactsChiProof/Variant171aacd4dd9e84404d03fd6405d409ad51830b7975bec1b457e75c71cdf93253.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/GammaFactsChiProof/Variant171aacd4dd9e84404d03fd6405d409ad51830b7975bec1b457e75c71cdf93253.lean#L360).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cf1486081a4e59a90670d111b5eeb029cba4094f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
