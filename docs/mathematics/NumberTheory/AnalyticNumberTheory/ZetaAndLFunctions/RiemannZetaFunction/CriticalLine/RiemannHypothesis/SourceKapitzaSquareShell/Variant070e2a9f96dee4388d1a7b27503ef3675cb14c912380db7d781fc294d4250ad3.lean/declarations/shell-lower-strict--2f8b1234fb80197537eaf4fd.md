## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2c724e87-2cba-b9b3-94b1-0025bf5026ca`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 91–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem shell_lower_strict {n : ℕ} (hn : 2 ≤ n) :
    (Nat.sqrt (n - 1)) ^ 2 < n := by
  have h := Nat.sqrt_le' (n - 1)
  have hl : n - 1 < n := by omega
  exact h.trans_lt hl

/-- The square shell's geometric diameter is strictly below one. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/SourceKapitzaSquareShell/Variant070e2a9f96dee4388d1a7b27503ef3675cb14c912380db7d781fc294d4250ad3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/SourceKapitzaSquareShell/Variant070e2a9f96dee4388d1a7b27503ef3675cb14c912380db7d781fc294d4250ad3.lean#L91).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8c015b841af27bb05e65f9b8217ed77c092c5ca4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
