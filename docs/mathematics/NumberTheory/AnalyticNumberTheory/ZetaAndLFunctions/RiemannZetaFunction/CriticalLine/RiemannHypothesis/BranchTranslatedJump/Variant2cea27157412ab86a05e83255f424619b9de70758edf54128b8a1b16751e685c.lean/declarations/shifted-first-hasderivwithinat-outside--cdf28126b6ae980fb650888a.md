## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c251056b-ccc3-758f-42ad-5ff04e36ac70`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 176–185.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem shifted_first_hasDerivWithinAt_outside {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) (t : ℝ) :
    HasDerivWithinAt (fun x ↦ deriv (q A) (x + t)) 0 (Ici (A - t)) (A - t) := by
  have h := (actual_first_derivative_hasDerivWithinAt_outside hA).comp_of_eq (A - t)
    (((hasDerivAt_id (A - t)).add_const t).hasDerivWithinAt)
    (show MapsTo (fun x : ℝ ↦ x + t) (Ici (A - t)) (Ici A) by
      intro x hx; change A - t ≤ x at hx; change A ≤ x + t; linarith) (by simp only [id_eq]; ring)
  simpa only [Function.comp_def, mul_one, id_eq] using h

/-- The complete source has two actual one-sided second derivatives with the precise
positive difference contributed by the single unmatched prime power. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/BranchTranslatedJump/Variant2cea27157412ab86a05e83255f424619b9de70758edf54128b8a1b16751e685c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/BranchTranslatedJump/Variant2cea27157412ab86a05e83255f424619b9de70758edf54128b8a1b16751e685c.lean#L176).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0eaa8ef6f20d2a855dca7eabac04adbe1decfcac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
