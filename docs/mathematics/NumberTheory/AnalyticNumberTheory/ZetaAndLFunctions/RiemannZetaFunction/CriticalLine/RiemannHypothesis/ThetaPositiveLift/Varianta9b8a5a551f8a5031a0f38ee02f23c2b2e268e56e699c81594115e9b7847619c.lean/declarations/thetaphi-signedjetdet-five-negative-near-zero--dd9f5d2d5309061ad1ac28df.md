## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:df907902-f301-a891-9a8a-34a485a5d22e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 93–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem thetaPhi_signedJetDet_five_negative_near_zero :
    ∃ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε ∧ ∀ t : ℝ, |t| < ε →
      signedJetDet 5 (fun n => thetaPhiDerivativeTapeValue n t) < 0 := by
  have hnhds := (continuous_thetaPhi_signedJetDet 5).continuousAt.eventually_lt
    continuousAt_const thetaPhi_signedJetDet_five_zero_neg
  obtain ⟨ε, hε, he⟩ := Metric.eventually_nhds_iff.mp hnhds
  refine ⟨ε, hε, fun t ht => he ?_⟩
  simpa [Real.dist_eq] using ht

/-- The existential choice of derivative tape cannot evade the obstruction:
the defining derivative equations uniquely identify the canonical tape. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/ThetaPositiveLift/Varianta9b8a5a551f8a5031a0f38ee02f23c2b2e268e56e699c81594115e9b7847619c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/ThetaPositiveLift/Varianta9b8a5a551f8a5031a0f38ee02f23c2b2e268e56e699c81594115e9b7847619c.lean#L93).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a399f827ddeaea1f78cf69cbe01735cff2a07fe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
