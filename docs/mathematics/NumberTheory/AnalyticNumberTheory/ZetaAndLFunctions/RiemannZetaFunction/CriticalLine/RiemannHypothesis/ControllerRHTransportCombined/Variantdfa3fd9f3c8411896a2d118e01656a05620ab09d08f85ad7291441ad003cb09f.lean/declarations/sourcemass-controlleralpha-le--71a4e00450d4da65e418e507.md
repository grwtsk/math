## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6424b27e-4003-4082-5ab6-671681c054a0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 101–109.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sourceMass_controllerAlpha_le (q : ℕ → H) (j : ℕ) (hj : 1 ≤ j) :
    sourceMass (controllerAlpha q j) ≤
      ‖referenceVector - sourceOperator (q j)‖ ^ 2 + 1 / (j : ℝ) := by
  exact (sourceMass_le_full_energy (controllerAlpha q j)
    (controllerAlpha_pos q j hj) (q j)).trans
      (add_le_add le_rfl (controllerAlpha_input_cost_le q j hj))

/-- Full residual convergence implies vanishing mass along the exact schedule.
This is a transport theorem, not a proof of the residual convergence hypothesis. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/ControllerRHTransportCombined/Variantdfa3fd9f3c8411896a2d118e01656a05620ab09d08f85ad7291441ad003cb09f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/ControllerRHTransportCombined/Variantdfa3fd9f3c8411896a2d118e01656a05620ab09d08f85ad7291441ad003cb09f.lean#L101).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `81aeb8e6f4fd6b9a6cd7ccf0dc1c031c93f47632` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
