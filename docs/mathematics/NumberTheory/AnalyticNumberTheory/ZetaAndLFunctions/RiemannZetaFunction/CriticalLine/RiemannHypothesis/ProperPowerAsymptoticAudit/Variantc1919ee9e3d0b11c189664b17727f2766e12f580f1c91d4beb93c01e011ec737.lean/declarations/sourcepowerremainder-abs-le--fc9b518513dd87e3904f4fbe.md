## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e50341d9-e7af-0f0a-21f0-ce883d0d3378`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–107.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sourcePowerRemainder_abs_le (A : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    |sourcePowerRemainder A| ≤ (2 * properPowerBudget) / A ^ 2 := by
  rw [sourcePowerRemainder, abs_mul, show |(-2 : ℝ)| = 2 by norm_num]
  calc
    _ ≤ 2 * (properPowerBudget / A ^ 2) :=
      mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left (properPowerError_abs_le A hA) (by norm_num)
    _ = _ := by ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/ProperPowerAsymptoticAudit/Variantc1919ee9e3d0b11c189664b17727f2766e12f580f1c91d4beb93c01e011ec737.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/ProperPowerAsymptoticAudit/Variantc1919ee9e3d0b11c189664b17727f2766e12f580f1c91d4beb93c01e011ec737.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `086b34c7fce0d3d1092a1cdf4eadd3775abad28c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
