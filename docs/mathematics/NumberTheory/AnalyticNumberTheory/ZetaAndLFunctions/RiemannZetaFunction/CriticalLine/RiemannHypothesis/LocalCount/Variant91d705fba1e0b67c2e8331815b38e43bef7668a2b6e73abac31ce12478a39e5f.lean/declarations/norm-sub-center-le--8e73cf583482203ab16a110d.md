## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c9c22466-8516-47d4-5de8-70ca776768ad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–100.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma norm_sub_center_le {ρ : ℂ} {t : ℝ} (h1 : 0 < ρ.re) (h2 : ρ.re < 1) (h3 : t < ρ.im)
    (h4 : ρ.im ≤ t + 1) : ‖ρ - (2 + t * I)‖ ≤ 3 := by
  refine (Complex.norm_le_abs_re_add_abs_im _).trans ?_
  have hre : (ρ - (2 + t * I)).re = ρ.re - 2 := by simp
  have him : (ρ - (2 + t * I)).im = ρ.im - t := by simp
  rw [hre, him, abs_of_neg (by linarith), abs_of_pos (by linarith)]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/LocalCount/Variant91d705fba1e0b67c2e8331815b38e43bef7668a2b6e73abac31ce12478a39e5f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/LocalCount/Variant91d705fba1e0b67c2e8331815b38e43bef7668a2b6e73abac31ce12478a39e5f.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `561807f25c3f2966d0a4f6d1e521dbfbcf0dd2e6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
