## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2792d01192e9cb49176470e4e117fb391b9bb237c40cf60b63a60e091767d650`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 37–44.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure DataDChi (P : Params) extends ThmE.DataChi P where
  /-- J := (2/L³) ∫_0^L g(y) y dy [eq:abJ]. -/
  JT : ℝ → ℝ

variable {P : Params} {q : ℕ} (D : DataDChi P)

/-- Hypotheses of the window-general χ-[thm:traces] assembly: ThmE.FactsChi with the sandwich
fields (sum_lower/sum_upper) replaced by sumJ and abdef by ab_range (as in ThmD.FactsD). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Traces/Variant8d8f0f52ba29b1d275fecdbe85c1ac1300de29c0eeef26eb1a507483f0a17b40.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Traces/Variant8d8f0f52ba29b1d275fecdbe85c1ac1300de29c0eeef26eb1a507483f0a17b40.lean#L37).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2013a6ca1e3b7da5aa0b8bc8c7e03cd5593171e4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
