## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eeef24b0-f924-7725-92b0-68ebbe289474`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 188–201.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem originalSourceL2_rotationMap_one_ne_two (c s : ℝ) :
    rotationMap c s (originalSourceL2 1 (by norm_num)) ≠
      originalSourceL2 2 (by norm_num) := by
  intro h
  have hrot : reflection (rotationMap c s (originalSourceL2 1 (by norm_num))) =
      rotationMap c s (originalSourceL2 1 (by norm_num)) := by
    rw [h]
    exact originalSourceL2_even 2 (by norm_num)
  have hs := rotation_even_forces_sine_zero (originalSourceL2_even 1 (by norm_num))
    (originalSourceL2_ne_zero 1 (by norm_num)) c s hrot
  rw [rotationMap_apply, hs, Complex.ofReal_zero, zero_smul, add_zero] at h
  exact originalSourceL2_two_ne_smul_one (c : ℂ) h.symm

/-- Every common-J angle is excluded by the actual source-class separation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/062SourcePureRotationObstruction/Variant6e83ff599eb76e8d7ec071115387a8d3121b57663ef16d810e6305acf0289d3c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/062SourcePureRotationObstruction/Variant6e83ff599eb76e8d7ec071115387a8d3121b57663ef16d810e6305acf0289d3c.lean#L188).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e77e1c67b5b008298b60b9b6a87cc276f9e3c0a9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
