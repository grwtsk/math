## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c256ddb45b68aefabf6575543c4495ab0ed56e9b1baf36de2be880baf4804382`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 641–656.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : MonoidalCategory (Rep.{u} k G) where
  tensorObj X Y := of (X.ρ.tprod Y.ρ)
  whiskerLeft X _ _ f := ofHom (lTensor X.ρ f.hom)
  whiskerRight f Z := ofHom (rTensor Z.ρ f.hom)
  tensorUnit := Rep.trivial k G k
  tensorHom f g := ofHom (f.hom.tensor g.hom)
  associator X Y Z := Rep.mkIso (assoc X.ρ Y.ρ Z.ρ)
  leftUnitor X := Rep.mkIso (lid k X.ρ)
  rightUnitor X := Rep.mkIso (rid k X.ρ)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Basic/Variantaafa42cc42af566b4ac74527b5e1dfbade4fb3e896134da61100ad7f3881fbf2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Basic/Variantaafa42cc42af566b4ac74527b5e1dfbade4fb3e896134da61100ad7f3881fbf2.lean#L641).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `49b945d3af3a4eecbfdd82f7abd24d436943c9ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
