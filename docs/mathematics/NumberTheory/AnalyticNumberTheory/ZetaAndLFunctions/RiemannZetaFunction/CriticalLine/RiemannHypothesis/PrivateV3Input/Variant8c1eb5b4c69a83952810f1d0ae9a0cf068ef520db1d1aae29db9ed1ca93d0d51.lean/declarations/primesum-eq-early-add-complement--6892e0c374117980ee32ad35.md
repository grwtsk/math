## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e924bc45-1150-831c-9e78-477def82cb37`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 129–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem primeSum_eq_early_add_complement {A : ℝ} (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    primeLogSum (2 * A) (pairedTailTest A) = earlyPrimeBlock A + complementaryPrimeBlocks A := by
  have hz := primeLogSum_abel 0 (le_refl 0) (pairedTailTest A) (pairedTailTest_contDiff hA)
  simp only [primeLogPrefix_zero, mul_zero, intervalIntegral.integral_same, sub_zero] at hz
  unfold earlyPrimeBlock complementaryPrimeBlocks primeLogWindow
  rw [hz]
  ring

/-- Any complete tail witness must repay the negative block and the full independent drift. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/PrivateV3Input/Variant8c1eb5b4c69a83952810f1d0ae9a0cf068ef520db1d1aae29db9ed1ca93d0d51.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/PrivateV3Input/Variant8c1eb5b4c69a83952810f1d0ae9a0cf068ef520db1d1aae29db9ed1ca93d0d51.lean#L129).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b8f59ed8817df53cf52f1946dc7bfd850045ff30` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
