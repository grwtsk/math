## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e3600945-55a0-caac-28a8-3ba11d13da3f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 153–162.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem sourceCostSet_bddBelow (A : ℝ) (x : ι → ℝ) (y : κ → ℝ)
    (u : ι → ℝ) (v : κ → ℝ) :
    BddBelow {z : ℝ | ∃ P : ι → κ → ℝ,
      IsPlan u v P ∧ sourcePlanCost A x y P = z} := by
  refine ⟨0, ?_⟩
  rintro z ⟨P, hP, rfl⟩
  exact Finset.sum_nonneg (fun i _ => Finset.sum_nonneg
    (fun j _ => mul_nonneg (hP.1 i j) (sourceDistance_nonneg A (x i) (y j))))

/-- Taking the infimum is justified by an actual feasible plan, including zero-mass plans. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/SourceConservativeComparison/Variantd4c015722bcfd850b000f823ef0a291813fbb4527dbc0dae5e4038c5a5a25ac7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/SourceConservativeComparison/Variantd4c015722bcfd850b000f823ef0a291813fbb4527dbc0dae5e4038c5a5a25ac7.lean#L153).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `611c614e258ecde3314f3704ff3d272e6b422eba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
