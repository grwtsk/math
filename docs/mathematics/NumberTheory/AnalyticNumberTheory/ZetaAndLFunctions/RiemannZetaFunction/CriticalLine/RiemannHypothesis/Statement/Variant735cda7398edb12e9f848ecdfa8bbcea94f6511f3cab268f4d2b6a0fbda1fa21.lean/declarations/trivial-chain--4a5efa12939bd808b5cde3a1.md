## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b3af75ef-138b-542b-3a6c-4e9d6e238063`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 165–186.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-! ## 4. Theorems A, B, C

The headline theorems Zeta23.thmA, thmA_cumulative, thmA_lam, thmB, thmB_cumulative, thmB_lam, thmC,
thmC_cumulative, thmC_lam are proved in Zeta23/Final.lean (their types display the full trust base:
literature explicit formula, Riemann–von Mangoldt, Montgomery–Vaughan, Γ-facts), on top of the
versions Zeta23.thmA_of_traces etc. in Zeta23/Main.lean (thm:traces as an explicit hypothesis). This file
stays light (definitions + anchors) so that it can be read and imported cheaply.

Paper [thm:A], verbatim: "Let 0 < λ ≤ 1 be fixed. There are constants c(λ) > 0 and T₀(λ) such that
for all T ≥ T₀(λ)   N₀*(T,2T) ≥ (H(λ) − c(λ) loglogT/logT) N(T,2T),
and for λ < 1 the factor loglog T may be omitted. In particular
  liminf_{T→∞} N₀*(T,2T)/N(T,2T) ≥ 2/3,   liminf_{T→∞} N₀*(T)/N(T) ≥ 2/3".
Formal target: the ε-forms, for each fixed λ ∈ (0,1) with constant
H(λ) (resp. 2F(λ)−1, F(λ)), which absorb c(λ)/log T; then the 2/3 (resp. 1/2, 3/4) forms via
sup_{λ<1} H(λ) = H(1) = 2/3 etc. The effective c(λ) forms are not stated. -/

/-- The statement of Theorem A (2/3, dyadic ε-form) as a Prop, for reference; Zeta23.thmA proves it. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Statement/Variant735cda7398edb12e9f848ecdfa8bbcea94f6511f3cab268f4d2b6a0fbda1fa21.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/Statement/Variant735cda7398edb12e9f848ecdfa8bbcea94f6511f3cab268f4d2b6a0fbda1fa21.lean#L165).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `74085fe35de31f060aa2edeadc55e1487b856dce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
