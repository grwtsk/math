## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:06e4699d-b13d-2984-d16e-12854bd9c22b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 21–35.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (∀ t : ℝ, t ∈ Icc 0 10 → 0 ≤ sourcePeanoPrimitive 5 t) ∧

  · obtain ⟨t, ht0, ht10, htneg⟩ :=
      sourceCorrelation_exists_neg_in_half_support (A := 5) (by norm_num)
    refine ⟨t, ht0, by linarith, ?_⟩
    rw [sourcePeanoPrimitive_second_deriv (by norm_num)]
    exact mul_neg_of_pos_of_neg (Real.exp_pos _) htneg

/-- The same actual primitive has positive center curvature, so neither curvature sign is global. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/PeanoSignFixtures/Variant63280449ce2fdba38920652c86a38efac94b13d37d7140685ba2abecf79cb619.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/PeanoSignFixtures/Variant63280449ce2fdba38920652c86a38efac94b13d37d7140685ba2abecf79cb619.lean#L21).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e2718607a525909c025c4962f621a35f2071b454` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
