## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:40a9b161-3f98-d818-ed63-49545816a3f7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 212–219.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem thetaExpNegFifteen_eq_fifth_expNegThree
    (A : ℝ) :
    Real.exp (-15 * A) =
      Real.exp (-3 * A) ^ 5 := by
  (convert! Real.exp_nat_mul (-3 * A) 5 using 1; ring_nf)

set_option maxHeartbeats 1000000 in
-- Exact normalization at denominator 64000000^5 exceeds the default heartbeat budget.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/ThetaPositiveLift/Variantf1105c0ee07b8cd57e2bb484f2e1fbcc29a762afac128d850a8cb96a713e8deb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/ThetaPositiveLift/Variantf1105c0ee07b8cd57e2bb484f2e1fbcc29a762afac128d850a8cb96a713e8deb.lean#L212).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5de3301d35bd878a95b962575f2f5fa0064cfda1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
