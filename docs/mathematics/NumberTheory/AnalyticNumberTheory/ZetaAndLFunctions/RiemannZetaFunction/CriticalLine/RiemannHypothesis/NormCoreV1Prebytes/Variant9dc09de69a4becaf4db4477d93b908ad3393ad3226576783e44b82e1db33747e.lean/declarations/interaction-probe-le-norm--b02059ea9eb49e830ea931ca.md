## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d4ff8bdb-d1c6-1dfb-4340-c5be872a0fa6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–165.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem interaction_probe_le_norm (A : ℝ) {R : ℝ} (hR : 0 < R) :
    (⟪originalSourceState R, mangoldtInteraction A (originalSourceState R)⟫_ℂ).re ≤
      ‖mangoldtInteraction A‖ := by
  have h := re_inner_le_norm (𝕜 := ℂ) (originalSourceState R)
    (mangoldtInteraction A (originalSourceState R))
  have hq := originalSourceState_norm hR
  rw [hq, one_mul] at h
  exact h.trans (by simpa only [hq, mul_one] using
    (mangoldtInteraction A).le_opNorm (originalSourceState R))

/-- The finite mass is reached arbitrarily closely, without a constant L² vector. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/NormCoreV1Prebytes/Variant9dc09de69a4becaf4db4477d93b908ad3393ad3226576783e44b82e1db33747e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/NormCoreV1Prebytes/Variant9dc09de69a4becaf4db4477d93b908ad3393ad3226576783e44b82e1db33747e.lean#L155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9127978625ca0c61de8584807a41057556775863` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
