## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:be9e55da1c9aa4c0ca17608b35053d72fd95d8bed7af7e97b9e7f9fd8cc9d1bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 4207–4211.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example (u : ℝ) :
    (∫ t in 1..Real.exp u, Chebyshev.theta t / t ^ 2) =
      ∫ v in 0..u, 1 + thetaLogError v :=
  FormalResearch.RiemannHypothesis.SourceComparison.PrimeHarmonicPrefix.theta_div_sq_log_substitution u

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/IntegratedPermanentStatements/Variant80a139dfdc12b379bb99cf5f78d59fb78ac4703bcaaa0a8c370e86f21f0f83d9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/ZetaAndLFunctions/RiemannZetaFunction/CriticalLine/RiemannHypothesis/IntegratedPermanentStatements/Variant80a139dfdc12b379bb99cf5f78d59fb78ac4703bcaaa0a8c370e86f21f0f83d9.lean#L4207).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3aa63cad6e8141b6a1e3c82df481733a319a62d7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
