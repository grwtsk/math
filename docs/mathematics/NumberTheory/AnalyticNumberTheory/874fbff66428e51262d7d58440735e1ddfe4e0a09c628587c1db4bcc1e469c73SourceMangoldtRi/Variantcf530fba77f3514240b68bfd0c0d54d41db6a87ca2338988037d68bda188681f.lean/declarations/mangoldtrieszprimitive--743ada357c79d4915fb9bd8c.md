## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c070d205efaf3ff99a09df027fc9beffcb20bb45067c7fa19df81c3b1ba65aa1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 38–42.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mangoldtRieszPrimitive (t : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  (∑ n ∈ primePowerInventory t,
    vonMangoldt n / Real.sqrt n * (t - Real.log n)) - continuumRieszPrimitive t

/-- The complete arithmetic and continuum primitive has zero retained initial value. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/874fbff66428e51262d7d58440735e1ddfe4e0a09c628587c1db4bcc1e469c73SourceMangoldtRi/Variantcf530fba77f3514240b68bfd0c0d54d41db6a87ca2338988037d68bda188681f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/AnalyticNumberTheory/874fbff66428e51262d7d58440735e1ddfe4e0a09c628587c1db4bcc1e469c73SourceMangoldtRi/Variantcf530fba77f3514240b68bfd0c0d54d41db6a87ca2338988037d68bda188681f.lean#L38).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f34b18088dc057d23bdf4e79387c9185ac8815a8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
