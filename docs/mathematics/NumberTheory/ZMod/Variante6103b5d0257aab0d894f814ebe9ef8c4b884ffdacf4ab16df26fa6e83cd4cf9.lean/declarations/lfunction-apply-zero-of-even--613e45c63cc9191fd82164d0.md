## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4ff83ae2-f809-decb-e75f-9e64fc2be41c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 271–277.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma LFunction_apply_zero_of_even (hΦ : Φ.Even) :
    LFunction Φ 0 = -Φ 0 / 2 := by
  simp only [LFunction_def_even hΦ, neg_zero, cpow_zero, hurwitzZetaEven_apply_zero,
    toAddCircle_eq_zero, mul_ite, mul_div, mul_neg_one, mul_zero, sum_ite_eq', Finset.mem_univ,
    ↓reduceIte, one_mul]

/-- The L-function of an even function vanishes at negative even integers. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ZMod/Variante6103b5d0257aab0d894f814ebe9ef8c4b884ffdacf4ab16df26fa6e83cd4cf9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ZMod/Variante6103b5d0257aab0d894f814ebe9ef8c4b884ffdacf4ab16df26fa6e83cd4cf9.lean#L271).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `877b3290807830b2260b8959a1fbfd32a04f196b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
