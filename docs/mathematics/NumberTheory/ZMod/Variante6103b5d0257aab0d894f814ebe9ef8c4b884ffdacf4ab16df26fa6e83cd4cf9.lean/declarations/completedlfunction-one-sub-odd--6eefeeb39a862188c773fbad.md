## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c6d23668-9f54-4279-e5c1-87b736b328dc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 509–532.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem completedLFunction_one_sub_odd (hΦ : Φ.Odd) (s : ℂ) :
    completedLFunction Φ (1 - s) = N ^ (s - 1) * I * completedLFunction (𝓕 Φ) s := by
  -- This is much easier than the even case since both functions are entire.
  -- First set up some notations:
  let F (t) := completedLFunction Φ (1 - t)
  let G (t) := ↑N ^ (t - 1) * I * completedLFunction (𝓕 Φ) t
  -- check F, G globally differentiable
  have hF : Differentiable ℂ F := (differentiable_completedLFunction hΦ.map_zero
    hΦ.sum_eq_zero).comp (differentiable_id.const_sub 1)
  have hG : Differentiable ℂ G := by
    apply (((differentiable_id.sub_const 1).const_cpow (.inl (NeZero.ne _))).mul_const _).mul
    rw [← dft_odd_iff] at hΦ
    exact differentiable_completedLFunction hΦ.map_zero hΦ.sum_eq_zero
  -- set where we know equality
  have : {z | 1 < re z} ∈ 𝓝 2 := (continuous_re.isOpen_preimage _ isOpen_Ioi).mem_nhds (by simp)
  have hFG : F =ᶠ[𝓝 2] G := by filter_upwards [this] with t ht
    using completedLFunction_one_sub_of_one_lt_odd hΦ ht
  -- now apply the big hammer to finish
  rw [← analyticOnNhd_univ_iff_differentiable] at hF hG

end signed

end ZMod
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ZMod/Variante6103b5d0257aab0d894f814ebe9ef8c4b884ffdacf4ab16df26fa6e83cd4cf9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ZMod/Variante6103b5d0257aab0d894f814ebe9ef8c4b884ffdacf4ab16df26fa6e83cd4cf9.lean#L509).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `877b3290807830b2260b8959a1fbfd32a04f196b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
