## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:03a154de-b17e-0ded-d36d-d8a2ea5d4220`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 75–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma LSeriesSummable_of_one_lt_re (Φ : ZMod N → ℂ) {s : ℂ} (hs : 1 < re s) :
    LSeriesSummable (Φ ·) s := by
  let c := max' _ <| univ_nonempty.image (norm ∘ Φ)
  refine LSeriesSummable_of_bounded_of_one_lt_re (fun n _ ↦ le_max' _ _ ?_) (m := c) hs
  exact mem_image_of_mem _ (mem_univ _)

/--
The unique meromorphic function `ℂ → ℂ` which agrees with `∑' n : ℕ, Φ n / n ^ s` wherever the
latter is convergent. This is constructed as a linear combination of Hurwitz zeta functions.

Note that this is not the same as `LSeries Φ`: they agree in the convergence range, but
`LSeries Φ s` is defined to be `0` if `re s ≤ 1`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ZMod/Variantbb9aa32601d9db6b0719b400c0534ee75df3b94a3a02a96bfb473edd20d69061.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ZMod/Variantbb9aa32601d9db6b0719b400c0534ee75df3b94a3a02a96bfb473edd20d69061.lean#L75).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7ee2312e9873e481f5b28614ce42e81f8e7c55be` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
