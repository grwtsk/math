## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1105d629-6b93-720e-0c18-6f85436427fb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 333–342.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma completedLFunction_modOne_eq (Φ : ZMod 1 → ℂ) (s : ℂ) :
    completedLFunction Φ s = Φ 1 * completedRiemannZeta s := by
  rw [completedLFunction_def_even (show Φ.Even from fun _ ↦ congr_arg Φ (Subsingleton.elim ..)),
    Nat.cast_one, one_cpow, one_mul, ← singleton_eq_univ 0, sum_singleton, map_zero,
    completedHurwitzZetaEven_zero, Subsingleton.elim 0 1]

/--
The completed L-function of a function `ZMod N → ℂ`, modified by adding multiples of `N ^ (-s) / s`
and `N ^ (-s) / (1 - s)` to make it entire.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/ZMod/Variant1f9947deec2bf48b4d8ffaaa3fa365f513b3634000999b57997d5534786ebda6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/ZMod/Variant1f9947deec2bf48b4d8ffaaa3fa365f513b3634000999b57997d5534786ebda6.lean#L333).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `06c7cd326b587933ac3e0f4d6908e508aec2505e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
