## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4f756a7d-632a-91e4-93b0-e9ccedb38016`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 151–161.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem div_eq_filter_card {a b c : ℕ} (hb0 : 0 < b) (hc : a / b ≤ c) :
    a / b = #{x ∈ Ico 1 c.succ | x * b ≤ a} :=
  calc
    a / b = #(Ico 1 (a / b).succ) := by simp
    _ = #{x ∈ Ico 1 c.succ | x * b ≤ a} :=
      congr_arg _ <| Finset.ext fun x => by
        have : x * b ≤ a → x ≤ c := fun h => le_trans (by rwa [le_div_iff_mul_le hb0]) hc
        simp [le_div_iff_mul_le hb0]; tauto

  rectangle `(0, p/2) × (0, q/2)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/GaussEisensteinLemmas/Variant3759a89628657195bf37090bc38440c7266310ead4cb05abcc72b6f3bfca6e35.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/GaussEisensteinLemmas/Variant3759a89628657195bf37090bc38440c7266310ead4cb05abcc72b6f3bfca6e35.lean#L151).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `de1c9e93a464938136b41363748e9ce5bcc87415` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
