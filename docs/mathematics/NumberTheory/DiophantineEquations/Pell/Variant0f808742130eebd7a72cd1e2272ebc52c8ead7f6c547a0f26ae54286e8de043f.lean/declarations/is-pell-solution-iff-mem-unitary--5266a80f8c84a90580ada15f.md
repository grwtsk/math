## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:310ab7e3-032b-417f-7e8b-91b43932e3b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 81–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem is_pell_solution_iff_mem_unitary {d : ℤ} {a : ℤ√d} :
    a.re ^ 2 - d * a.im ^ 2 = 1 ↔ a ∈ unitary (ℤ√d) := by
  rw [← norm_eq_one_iff_mem_unitary, norm_def, sq, sq, ← mul_assoc]

-- We use `solution₁ d` to allow for a more general structure `solution d m` that
-- encodes solutions to `x^2 - d*y^2 = m` to be added later.
/-- `Pell.Solution₁ d` is the type of solutions to the Pell equation `x^2 - d*y^2 = 1`.
We define this in terms of elements of `ℤ√d` of norm one.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/Pell/Variant0f808742130eebd7a72cd1e2272ebc52c8ead7f6c547a0f26ae54286e8de043f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/Pell/Variant0f808742130eebd7a72cd1e2272ebc52c8ead7f6c547a0f26ae54286e8de043f.lean#L81).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f87d666b65f60fffd27dcd2be911526e4dd3f783` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
