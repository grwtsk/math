## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:948ff873-ee4f-33cb-ff00-b97c8935d2ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 627–644.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_zpow_or_neg_zpow {a₁ : Solution₁ d} (h : IsFundamental a₁) (a : Solution₁ d) :
    ∃ n : ℤ, a = a₁ ^ n ∨ a = -a₁ ^ n := by
  obtain ⟨b, hbx, hby, hb⟩ := exists_pos_variant h.d_pos a
  obtain ⟨n, hn⟩ := h.eq_pow_of_nonneg hbx hby
  rcases hb with (rfl | rfl | rfl | hb)
  · exact ⟨n, Or.inl (mod_cast hn)⟩
  · exact ⟨-n, Or.inl (by simp [hn])⟩
  · exact ⟨n, Or.inr (by simp [hn])⟩
  · rw [Set.mem_singleton_iff] at hb
    rw [hb]
    exact ⟨-n, Or.inr (by simp [hn])⟩

end IsFundamental

open Solution₁ IsFundamental

/-- When `d` is positive and not a square, then the group of solutions to the Pell equation
`x^2 - d*y^2 = 1` has a unique positive generator (up to sign). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/Pell/Variant670589932bf00ae3d3f563aeb3b09f51cfea4cef9425cadc8d287c710aa1f41e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/Pell/Variant670589932bf00ae3d3f563aeb3b09f51cfea4cef9425cadc8d287c710aa1f41e.lean#L627).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9c19465a0f8df240d4c519037da398f00b4ffbce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
