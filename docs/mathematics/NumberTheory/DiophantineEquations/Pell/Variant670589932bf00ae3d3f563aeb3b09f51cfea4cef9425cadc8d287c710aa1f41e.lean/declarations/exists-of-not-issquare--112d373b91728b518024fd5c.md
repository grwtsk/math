## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:03c93194-912a-95ca-b03b-2e774036750d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 468–492.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_of_not_isSquare (h₀ : 0 < d) (hd : ¬IsSquare d) :
    ∃ a : Solution₁ d, IsFundamental a := by
  obtain ⟨a, ha₁, ha₂⟩ := exists_pos_of_not_isSquare h₀ hd
  -- convert to `x : ℕ` to be able to use `Nat.find`
  have P : ∃ x' : ℕ, 1 < x' ∧ ∃ y' : ℤ, 0 < y' ∧ (x' : ℤ) ^ 2 - d * y' ^ 2 = 1 := by
    have hax := a.prop
    lift a.x to ℕ using by positivity with ax
    norm_cast at ha₁
    exact ⟨ax, ha₁, a.y, ha₂, hax⟩

  -- to avoid having to show that the predicate is decidable
  let x₁ := Nat.find P
  obtain ⟨hx, y₁, hy₀, hy₁⟩ := Nat.find_spec P
  refine ⟨mk x₁ y₁ hy₁, by rw [x_mk]; exact mod_cast hx, hy₀, fun {b} hb => ?_⟩

/-- The map sending an integer `n` to the `y`-coordinate of `a^n` for a fundamental
solution `a` is stritcly increasing. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/Pell/Variant670589932bf00ae3d3f563aeb3b09f51cfea4cef9425cadc8d287c710aa1f41e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/Pell/Variant670589932bf00ae3d3f563aeb3b09f51cfea4cef9425cadc8d287c710aa1f41e.lean#L468).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9c19465a0f8df240d4c519037da398f00b4ffbce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
