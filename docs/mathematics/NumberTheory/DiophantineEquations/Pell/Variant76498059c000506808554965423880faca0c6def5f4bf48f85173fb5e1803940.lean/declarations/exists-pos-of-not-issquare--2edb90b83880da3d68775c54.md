## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cdbbd17e-14b4-6b50-b1c4-487cb8f9081c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 470–493.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_pos_of_not_isSquare (h₀ : 0 < d) (hd : ¬IsSquare d) :
    ∃ a : Solution₁ d, 1 < a.x ∧ 0 < a.y := by
  obtain ⟨x, y, h, hy⟩ := exists_of_not_isSquare h₀ hd
  refine' ⟨mk |x| |y| (by rwa [sq_abs, sq_abs]), _, abs_pos.mpr hy⟩
  rw [x_mk, ← one_lt_sq_iff_one_lt_abs, eq_add_of_sub_eq h, lt_add_iff_pos_right]
  exact mul_pos h₀ (sq_pos_of_ne_zero y hy)
#align pell.solution₁.exists_pos_of_not_is_square Pell.Solution₁.exists_pos_of_not_isSquare

end Solution₁

end Existence

/-! ### Fundamental solutions

We define the notion of a *fundamental solution* of Pell's equation and
show that it exists and is unique (when `d` is positive and non-square)
and generates the group of solutions up to sign.
-/


variable {d : ℤ}

/-- We define a solution to be *fundamental* if it has `x > 1` and `y > 0`
and its `x` is the smallest possible among solutions with `x > 1`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/Pell/Variant76498059c000506808554965423880faca0c6def5f4bf48f85173fb5e1803940.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/Pell/Variant76498059c000506808554965423880faca0c6def5f4bf48f85173fb5e1803940.lean#L470).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `91c03851fa8c4a2b26e030fb2f66e8da20a71f30` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
