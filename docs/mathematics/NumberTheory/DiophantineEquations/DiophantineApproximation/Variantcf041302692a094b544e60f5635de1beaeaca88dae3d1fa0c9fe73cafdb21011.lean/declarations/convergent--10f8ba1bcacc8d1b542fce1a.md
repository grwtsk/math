## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:28f22dcc9f4d60420a99ca09eb9fef71f83a383814aabf7e0e47ba6f9fda3a38`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 345–351.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def convergent : ℝ → ℕ → ℚ
  | ξ, 0 => ⌊ξ⌋
  | ξ, n + 1 => ⌊ξ⌋ + (convergent (fract ξ)⁻¹ n)⁻¹
#align real.convergent Real.convergent

/-- The zeroth convergent of `ξ` is `⌊ξ⌋`. -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/DiophantineApproximation/Variantcf041302692a094b544e60f5635de1beaeaca88dae3d1fa0c9fe73cafdb21011.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/DiophantineApproximation/Variantcf041302692a094b544e60f5635de1beaeaca88dae3d1fa0c9fe73cafdb21011.lean#L345).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1fefffd0d1f9f27fec2b4fbc7911a7592389611e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
