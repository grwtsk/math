## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:db62f03febd0d55793b1ea13e1b75b8a03757ddd5e6790235426c4d53e825955`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 407–413.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ContfracLegendre.Ass (ξ : ℝ) (u v : ℤ) : Prop :=
  IsCoprime u v ∧ (v = 1 → (-(1 / 2) : ℝ) < ξ - u) ∧
    |ξ - u / v| < ((v : ℝ) * (2 * v - 1))⁻¹
#align real.contfrac_legendre.ass Real.ContfracLegendre.Ass

-- ### Auxiliary lemmas
-- This saves a few lines below, as it is frequently needed.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/DiophantineApproximation/Variantef9cc6379cd9d35b01bfa8a8939680126d845c07a0801180fc821bc95cd47fa1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/DiophantineApproximation/Variantef9cc6379cd9d35b01bfa8a8939680126d845c07a0801180fc821bc95cd47fa1.lean#L407).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `905ff2830110628e736743f6804825b693e65939` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
