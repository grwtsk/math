## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:885cfd87-9a4e-0911-a630-689eb8d33a6a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 278–298.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem sumsq_eq_zero (x) : ∀ l, sumsq l x = 0 ↔ l.All₂ fun a : Poly α => a x = 0
  | [] => eq_self_iff_true _
  | p::ps => by

          eq_zero_of_mul_self_eq_zero <|
            le_antisymm
              (by
                rw [← h]
                have t := add_le_add_left (sumsq_nonneg x ps) (p x * p x)
                rwa [add_zero] at t)
              (mul_self_nonneg _)
        ⟨this, by simp [this] at h; exact h⟩,
      fun ⟨h1, h2⟩ => by rw [add_apply, mul_apply, h1, h2]; rfl⟩
#align poly.sumsq_eq_zero Poly.sumsq_eq_zero

end

/-- Map the index set of variables, replacing `x_i` with `x_(f i)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/Dioph/Variantb00ade6c11e5a3a4d17e738c8c35502fc618af0b702d25f348be7528478bdb08.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/Dioph/Variantb00ade6c11e5a3a4d17e738c8c35502fc618af0b702d25f348be7528478bdb08.lean#L278).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f71afed2b47ebfcc74931ab6af18f84857689f78` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
