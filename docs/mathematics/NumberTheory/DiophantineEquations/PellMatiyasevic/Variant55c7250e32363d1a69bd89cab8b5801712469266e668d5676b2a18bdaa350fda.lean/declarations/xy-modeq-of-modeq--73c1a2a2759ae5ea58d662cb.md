## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2039628a-46f7-6428-4e36-b78b32d6e38e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 734–745.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem xy_modEq_of_modEq {a b c} (a1 : 1 < a) (b1 : 1 < b) (h : a ≡ b [MOD c]) :
    ∀ n, xn a1 n ≡ xn b1 n [MOD c] ∧ yn a1 n ≡ yn b1 n [MOD c]
  | 0 => by constructor <;> rfl
  | 1 => by simpa using ⟨h, ModEq.refl 1⟩
  | n + 2 =>
    ⟨(xy_modEq_of_modEq a1 b1 h n).left.add_right_cancel <| by
        rw [xn_succ_succ a1, xn_succ_succ b1]
        exact (h.mul_left _).mul (xy_modEq_of_modEq _ _ h (n + 1)).left,
      (xy_modEq_of_modEq a1 b1 h n).right.add_right_cancel <| by
        rw [yn_succ_succ a1, yn_succ_succ b1]
        exact (h.mul_left _).mul (xy_modEq_of_modEq _ _ h (n + 1)).right⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/PellMatiyasevic/Variant55c7250e32363d1a69bd89cab8b5801712469266e668d5676b2a18bdaa350fda.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/DiophantineEquations/PellMatiyasevic/Variant55c7250e32363d1a69bd89cab8b5801712469266e668d5676b2a18bdaa350fda.lean#L734).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `11538141504660b997cf1f4a4eb3f1db224faff5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
