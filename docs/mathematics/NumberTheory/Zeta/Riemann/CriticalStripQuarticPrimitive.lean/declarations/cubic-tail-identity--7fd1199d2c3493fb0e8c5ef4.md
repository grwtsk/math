## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:107c8d87-2ffa-13c7-dfb2-bcaa7def69bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 364–374.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cubic_tail_identity {N : ℕ} {s : ℂ} (hN : 1 ≤ N) (hs : 0 < s.re) :
    CubicPrimitive.tail N s = (N : ℂ) ^ (-(s + 3)) / 720 +
      (s + 3) * centeredTail N s := by
  have hNR : (1 : ℝ) ≤ N := by exact_mod_cast hN
  have hsp : s + 3 ≠ 0 := Complex.ne_zero_of_re_pos (by
    simp only [Complex.add_re, Complex.ofNat_re]; linarith)
  rw [integer_tail_identity hN hs, centeredTail_eq hNR hs]
  simp only [Complex.ofReal_natCast]
  field_simp [hsp] <;> ring

/-- The factor 9-s is essential; the reference is not a globally nonzero polynomial. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CriticalStripQuarticPrimitive.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CriticalStripQuarticPrimitive.lean#L364).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `45c3117e84bd805c0a0c72020247b6e1c76f56bf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
