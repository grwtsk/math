## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:21b17651-2d16-febd-c675-0d5d85e881c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 137–151.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cubic_halfPlane_convex : Convex ℝ {s : ℂ | -2 < s.re} := by
  intro x hx y hy a b ha hb hab
  change (-2 : ℝ) < x.re at hx
  change (-2 : ℝ) < y.re at hy
  change (-2 : ℝ) < (a • x + b • y).re
  simp only [Complex.add_re, Complex.smul_re, smul_eq_mul]

    simpa only [ha0, hb1, zero_mul, one_mul, zero_add] using hy
  · have ha' : 0 < a := lt_of_le_of_ne ha (Ne.symm ha0)
    have hax : a * (-2) < a * x.re := mul_lt_mul_of_pos_left hx ha'
    have hby : b * (-2) ≤ b * y.re := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left hy.le hb

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CubicZetaIdentity.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CubicZetaIdentity.lean#L137).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4543990a599ffb9fb6e6cb0f2b32c75a89bc7b5b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
