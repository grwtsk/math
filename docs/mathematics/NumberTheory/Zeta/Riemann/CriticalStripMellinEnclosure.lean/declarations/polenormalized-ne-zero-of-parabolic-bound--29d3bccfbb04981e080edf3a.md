## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b5701c7b-abad-18d6-433c-917836b8129d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–157.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem poleNormalized_ne_zero_of_parabolic_bound {s : ℂ}
    (hpar : s.im ^ 2 < 2 * s.re - 1) : poleNormalizedZeta s ≠ 0 := by
  have hs : 0 < s.re := by nlinarith [sq_nonneg s.im]
  apply poleNormalized_ne_zero_of_mellin_distance hs
  have heq := Complex.norm_mul_self_eq_normSq (s - 1)
  simp only [Complex.normSq_apply, Complex.sub_re, Complex.one_re,
    Complex.sub_im, Complex.one_im, sub_zero] at heq
  by_contra hnot
  have hle : s.re ≤ ‖s - 1‖ := le_of_not_gt hnot
  have hsq := mul_nonneg (sub_nonneg.mpr hle) (add_nonneg (norm_nonneg (s - 1)) hs.le)
  nlinarith

/-- The already sourced critical reflection supplies the left parabolic bound.
It is used on zero records, not as a value identity for H. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CriticalStripMellinEnclosure.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CriticalStripMellinEnclosure.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4e2a4db879cf9c5d47ee717f98d4716e346ff3d6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
