## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:92dcdf28af7c411def6ee31c895eae81967da4311f8c220b4d894efa50ef6c74`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 63–74.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def scan (c : Coordinates) (p : RationalPoleValue.Parameters) :
    ℕ → ℕ → Accum → Packet → Option Accum
  | _, 0, a, [] => some a
  | _, 0, _, _ :: _ => none
  | _, _+1, _, [] => none
  | j, n+1, a, row :: rest =>
    match CheckedIntegerPower.evaluate c ((j+1 : ℕ) : ℚ)
        (RationalPoleValue.resolution p (j+1)) row with
    | none => none
    | some v => scan c p (j+1) n (advance p (j+1) v a) rest

/-- Every output field is the original ordered recurrence, not just a valid ball. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CheckedPoleJet.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CheckedPoleJet.lean#L63).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `64a511b0d114f6f7d8aa83cfba33256c23053d80` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
