## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a1557a9bc688e89aa91169491dfc9ea1d8e74f1f8788ffc64838749f105977be`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 703–719.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def sourceBoundPolarizedPacket (M : ℕ) :
    SourceBoundPolarizedPacket M where
  binding := polarizedSourceBinding
  testClass :=
    "Fin(M+1)->C coefficients on canonical square tents with source stages i+2"
  polarizationProfile :=
    "orthogonal arithmetic direct sum; K_ij=delta_ij*primePowerGram_i;" ++
    " raw finite-head residual retained before real Hermitian projection;" ++
    " no classical Weil test-class or normalization transport"
  binding_eq := rfl
  target := sourcePolarizedForm
  finiteApproximation := finitePolarizedForm
  rawResidual := rawResidualForm
  approximation := approximatePositiveApproximation M

/-- Hostile control: source orthogonality does not assert a classical Weil
cross-term theorem.  The declaration records only the exact arithmetic matrix. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CanonicalSquareTentPolarization.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CanonicalSquareTentPolarization.lean#L703).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0fced6fc958031623daec748c60b17295d92b552` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
