## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5ebcca32-7514-7860-530d-596a49f6c5d6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 40–52.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nineHeight_multiplier_bound {s : ℂ}
    (hx : (1 / 2 : ℝ) ≤ s.re) (hx1 : s.re ≤ 1) (hy : |s.im| ≤ (9 : ℝ)) :
    ‖multiplier s‖ ≤ (155 / 132 : ℝ) * (s.re + 5) * referenceFactors s := by
  have h := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right (nineHeight_joint_bound hx hx1 hy)
    (mul_nonneg (norm_nonneg (s + 2)) (norm_nonneg (s + 4)))
  calc
    ‖multiplier s‖ = jointNumerator s * (‖s + 2‖ * ‖s + 4‖) := by
      simp only [multiplier, QuarticPrimitive.multiplier, CubicPrimitive.multiplier,
        norm_mul, jointNumerator]
      ring
    _ ≤ ((155 / 132 : ℝ) * jointDenominator s) * (‖s + 2‖ * ‖s + 4‖) := h
    _ = _ := by unfold jointDenominator referenceFactors; ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CriticalStripNineHeightSeed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CriticalStripNineHeightSeed.lean#L40).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27a73d8d2cdea5a84ae16359a6aef453eb5d8b85` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
