## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5d216f51-bd43-d4db-2eed-67dc80a5e25f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–64.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma sevenJointDenominator_sq (s : ℂ) :
    sevenJointDenominator s ^ 2 = SevenHeightCertificate.denominator s.re (s.im ^ 2) := by
  simp only [sevenJointDenominator, mul_pow, Complex.sq_norm, Complex.normSq_apply,
    Complex.add_re, Complex.add_im, Complex.sub_re, Complex.sub_im,
    Complex.one_re, Complex.one_im, Complex.ofNat_re, Complex.ofNat_im,
    add_zero, sub_zero, zero_sub, SevenHeightCertificate.denominator]
  ring

/-- The degree-(8,4) real certificate controls the whole continuum of source points.
Taking square roots is justified by separate nonnegativity proofs. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CriticalStripSevenHeightSeed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CriticalStripSevenHeightSeed.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6a9cfb6768611b8bf80bfed187f9912ffceec463` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
