## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7de11813-d9b6-d550-4bcf-2355e58f1730`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 210–219.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tail_norm_le {T σ : ℝ} {s : ℂ} (hT : 1 ≤ T) (hσ : 0 < σ) (hs : σ ≤ s.re) :
    ‖tail T s‖ ≤ T ^ (-(σ + 5)) / (30240 * (σ + 5)) := by
  have h := sixthKernel.tail_norm_le (z := s + 6) (σ := σ + 6) hT
    (by linarith) (by simp only [Complex.add_re, Complex.ofNat_re]; linarith)
  change ‖tail T s‖ ≤ (1 / 30240 : ℝ) *
    (T ^ (-((σ + 6) - 1)) / ((σ + 6) - 1)) at h
  rw [show (σ + 6) - 1 = σ + 5 by ring] at h
  exact h.trans_eq (by ring)

/-- The mean contribution is integrated with a nonzero complex denominator. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CriticalStripSexticPrimitive.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CriticalStripSexticPrimitive.lean#L210).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e2e757d62d2aa098cf88c5ccd31c47f0657e790f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
