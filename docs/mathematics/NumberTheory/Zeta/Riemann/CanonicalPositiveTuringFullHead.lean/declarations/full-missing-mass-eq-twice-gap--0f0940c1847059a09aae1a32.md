## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:312a697f-3fbe-b6e1-219e-e0c5847e1a08`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 124–145.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem full_missing_mass_eq_twice_gap
    (packet : CanonicalPositiveTuringPacket family) :
    mass (heightHead packet.certificate.height \ fullKnownPoints packet) multiplicity =
      2 * packet.certificate.gap := by
  have partition := remaining_add_known
    (heightHead packet.certificate.height) (fullKnownPoints packet) multiplicity
    packet.fullKnownPoints_subset_heightHead
  have knownMass := packet.fullKnownPoints_mass_eq_twice_certifiedCount
  have totalMass :
      mass (heightHead packet.certificate.height) multiplicity =
        2 * packet.certificate.totalCount := by
    calc
      mass (heightHead packet.certificate.height) multiplicity =
          heightCount packet.certificate.height := rfl
      _ = 2 * packet.certificate.totalCount :=
        packet.heightCount_eq_twice_totalCount
  have certifiedLe := packet.certificate.certified_le_total
  unfold TuringCountCertificate.gap
  rw [knownMass, totalMass] at partition
  omega

/-- Zero positive-height gap gives the exact complete absolute-height inventory. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CanonicalPositiveTuringFullHead.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CanonicalPositiveTuringFullHead.lean#L124).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `35bf67032adde4213817968469a2fc03d71c3da4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
