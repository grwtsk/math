## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a6049999-4a42-553f-4e86-28adb4312bff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 186–192.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma region_norms {s : ℂ} (hs : Region s) : ‖s‖ ≤ (16 : ℝ) ∧ ‖s-1‖ ≤ (17 : ℝ) := by
  have hn := Complex.norm_le_abs_re_add_abs_im s
  have hr : |s.re| ≤ (1 : ℝ) := by rw [abs_of_pos hs.1]; exact hs.2.1
  have hi : |s.im| ≤ (15 : ℝ) := by rw [abs_of_nonneg (by linarith [hs.2.2.1])]; exact hs.2.2.2
  have h : ‖s‖ ≤ (16 : ℝ) := by linarith
  exact ⟨h, (norm_sub_le s 1).trans (by norm_num; linarith)⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CriticalStripSixteenDerivativeSource.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CriticalStripSixteenDerivativeSource.lean#L186).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8b8c1570d8e3aaf419e33610d00a93d0be37161a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
