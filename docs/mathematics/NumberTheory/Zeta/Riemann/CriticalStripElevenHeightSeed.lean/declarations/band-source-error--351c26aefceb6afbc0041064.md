## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d7cdcbe4-9f9f-7a7d-753c-b0b706b30fff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem band_source_error {s : ℂ} (hx : (1/2 : ℝ) ≤ s.re) (hx1 : s.re ≤ 1)
    (hlo : (10 : ℝ) ≤ |s.im|) (hhi : |s.im| ≤ (11 : ℝ)) :
    ‖poleNormalizedZeta s-(s-1)‖ ≤ (9999/10000 : ℝ)*‖s-1‖ := by
  have he : finiteModel 2 s-(s-1) = power s*coefficient s := by rw [finiteModel_two]; ring
  calc
    _ = ‖(poleNormalizedZeta s-finiteModel 2 s)+(finiteModel 2 s-(s-1))‖ := by congr 1; ring
    _ ≤ ‖poleNormalizedZeta s-finiteModel 2 s‖+‖finiteModel 2 s-(s-1)‖ := norm_add_le _ _
    _ ≤ (99/140 : ℝ)*(7/16)*‖s-1‖+(99/140)*(1953/2000)*‖s-1‖ := by
      rw [he]
      exact add_le_add (tail_term_bound hx hx1 hlo hhi) (finite_term_bound hx hx1 hlo hhi)
    _ = _ := by ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CriticalStripElevenHeightSeed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/CriticalStripElevenHeightSeed.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `73bfb3df3acd33a26689a28edb1bbfe2c80d40a8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
