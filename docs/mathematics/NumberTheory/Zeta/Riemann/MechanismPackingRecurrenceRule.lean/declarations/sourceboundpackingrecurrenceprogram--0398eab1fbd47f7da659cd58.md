## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ee7ca40b25ed9cc792a30c9910a5e4c4d30039ec4b9ab4c98e6559f86457a29a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 34–53.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure SourceBoundPackingRecurrenceProgram
    (Source Local : Type*)
    [AddCommGroup Source] [AddCommGroup Local]
    [Module ℝ Source] [Module ℝ Local]
    [TopologicalSpace Source] [TopologicalSpace Local] where
  accepted : SourceBoundMechanismBridgeAccepted Source Local
  IsPrimePowerSource : ℕ → Prop
  initial : Local → ThreePointPackingState IsPrimePowerSource
  nextPoint :
    Local → ℕ → ThreePointPackingState IsPrimePowerSource → PackingPoint
  nextSource :
    Local → ℕ → ThreePointPackingState IsPrimePowerSource → ℕ
  nextSource_ok :
    ∀ localData n state,
      IsPrimePowerSource (nextSource localData n state)

namespace SourceBoundPackingRecurrenceProgram

/-- The unique local witness extracted from the accepted source-bound mechanism
trace and its continuous linear/form bridge. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/MechanismPackingRecurrenceRule.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/MechanismPackingRecurrenceRule.lean#L34).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a2c23a2e7d35a2a0be5cf59786ff437c92497932` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
