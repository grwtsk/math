## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:acba1f00-3813-8532-ffa7-9a1b48c70149`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 142–160.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem heightCount_ge_two {z : ZeroPoint} {T : ℝ}
    (hnot : z.1.im ≠ 0) (hh : height z ≤ T) : 2 ≤ heightCount T := by
  classical
  have hne := ne_conjugate_of_im_ne_zero hnot
  have hz : z ∈ heightHead T := (mem_heightHead T z).mpr hh
  have hw : conjugatePoint z ∈ heightHead T :=
    (mem_heightHead T (conjugatePoint z)).mpr (by simpa only [conjugate_height] using hh)
  have hsub : ({z, conjugatePoint z} : Finset ZeroPoint) ⊆ heightHead T := by
    intro v hv
    simp only [Finset.mem_insert, Finset.mem_singleton] at hv
    rcases hv with rfl | rfl
    · exact hz
    · exact hw
  calc
    2 = ({z, conjugatePoint z} : Finset ZeroPoint).card := by simp [hne]
    _ ≤ (heightHead T).card := Finset.card_le_card hsub
    _ ≤ heightCount T := head_card_le_heightCount T

end GRWTSK.RiemannHypothesis.LocalZeroSymmetry
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/LocalZeroSymmetry.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/LocalZeroSymmetry.lean#L142).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `95bb6d41a9aa97ecd6da8ba1dc6d813241a71833` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
