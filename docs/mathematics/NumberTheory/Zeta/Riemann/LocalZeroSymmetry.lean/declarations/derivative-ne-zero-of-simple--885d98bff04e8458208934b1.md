## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6bd0feb8-e33c-40b9-1ebd-070c945202fa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 69–84.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem derivative_ne_zero_of_simple {z : ZeroPoint} (hm : multiplicity z = 1) :
    deriv riemannZeta z.1 ≠ 0 := by
  obtain ⟨g, hg, hg0, hfg⟩ := multiplicity_factorization z
  have heq : riemannZeta =ᶠ[𝓝 z.1] (fun w => (w - z.1) * g w) := by
    filter_upwards [hfg] with w hw
    simpa only [hm, pow_one, smul_eq_mul] using hw
  have hd := ((hasDerivAt_id z.1).sub_const z.1).mul hg.differentiableAt.hasDerivAt
  have he : deriv riemannZeta z.1 = g z.1 := by
    calc
      _ = deriv (fun w => (w - z.1) * g w) z.1 := heq.deriv_eq
      _ = g z.1 := by simpa only [Pi.mul_def, id_eq, sub_self, one_mul, zero_mul, add_zero] using hd.deriv
  rw [he]
  exact hg0

/-- Conjugating both input and output preserves complex differentiability.
Conjugation of the output alone would not justify this derivative theorem. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/LocalZeroSymmetry.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/LocalZeroSymmetry.lean#L69).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `95bb6d41a9aa97ecd6da8ba1dc6d813241a71833` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
