## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:de3aedbf673d10ea3698b809c0453665139f98863de18f88a84d30f8ad9e7fad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 311–322.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure CommutingInvolutionPair
    (X : Type*) [AddCommGroup X] [Module ℝ X] [TopologicalSpace X] where
  first : X →ₗ[ℝ] X
  second : X →ₗ[ℝ] X
  first_continuous : Continuous (fun x => first x)
  second_continuous : Continuous (fun x => second x)
  first_involutive : Function.Involutive first
  second_involutive : Function.Involutive second
  commute : Function.Commute first second

/-- Real bilinear-form transport through a linear/topological carrier map,
including the two commuting involutions and a quantified comparison defect. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/SevenEighthsMechanismQuarticBridge.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/SevenEighthsMechanismQuarticBridge.lean#L311).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dfba6ca8f82e1b12ab4248e8c6b4541e86955f5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
