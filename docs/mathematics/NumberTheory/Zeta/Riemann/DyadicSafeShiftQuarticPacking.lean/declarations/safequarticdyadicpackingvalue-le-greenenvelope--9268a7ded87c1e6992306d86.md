## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ebb38bc5-48c8-01a3-1ec3-d83504ffaecb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 389–403.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem safeQuarticDyadicPackingValue_le_greenEnvelope
    (z : ZeroPoint) (j : ℕ) :
    safeQuarticDyadicPackingValue z j ≤
      148 * safeDyadicEnvelopePairProduct z j := by
  have hA :=
    (safeAxialDyadicPacking z j).gramVolume_le_edgeProductEnclosure
  have hT :=
    (safeTransverseDyadicPacking z j).gramVolume_le_edgeProductEnclosure
  have hAE := safeAxialDyadic_edgeProduct_le z j
  have hTE := safeTransverseDyadic_edgeProduct_le z j
  unfold safeQuarticDyadicPackingValue
    safeAxialDyadicGram safeTransverseDyadicGram
  nlinarith

end GRWTSK.RiemannHypothesis
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/DyadicSafeShiftQuarticPacking.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/DyadicSafeShiftQuarticPacking.lean#L389).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `41227433d053477cc82cf2a39b7046424e78eeec` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
