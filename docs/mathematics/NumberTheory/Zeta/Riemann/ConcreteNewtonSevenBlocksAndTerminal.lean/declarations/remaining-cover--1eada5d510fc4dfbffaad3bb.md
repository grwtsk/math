## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6a2985a4-0888-65a3-a521-b0c261f9f2a6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–106.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem remaining_cover (b : Fin 64)
    (h0 : b ≠ 0) (h1 : b ≠ 1) (h2 : b ≠ 2)
    (h3 : b ≠ 3) (h4 : b ≠ 4) (h5 : b ≠ 5) (h6 : b ≠ 6) :
    ∃ j : Fin 57, remainingBlock j = b := by
  have hb := b.isLt
  have hb0 : b.1 ≠ 0 := by intro h; apply h0; exact Fin.ext h
  have hb1 : b.1 ≠ 1 := by intro h; apply h1; exact Fin.ext h
  have hb2 : b.1 ≠ 2 := by intro h; apply h2; exact Fin.ext h
  have hb3 : b.1 ≠ 3 := by intro h; apply h3; exact Fin.ext h
  have hb4 : b.1 ≠ 4 := by intro h; apply h4; exact Fin.ext h
  have hb5 : b.1 ≠ 5 := by intro h; apply h5; exact Fin.ext h
  have hb6 : b.1 ≠ 6 := by intro h; apply h6; exact Fin.ext h
  refine ⟨⟨b.1 - 7, by omega⟩, ?_⟩
  apply Fin.ext
  change b.1 - 7 + 7 = b.1
  omega

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/ConcreteNewtonSevenBlocksAndTerminal.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Zeta/Riemann/ConcreteNewtonSevenBlocksAndTerminal.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `645cc69558f70c18ad6abb19a2dbffdcd0936fb8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
