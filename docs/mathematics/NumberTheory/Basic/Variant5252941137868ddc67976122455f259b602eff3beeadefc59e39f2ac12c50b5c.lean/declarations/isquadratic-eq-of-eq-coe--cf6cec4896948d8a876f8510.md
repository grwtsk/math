## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e4da3ca2-0edf-3fea-1634-f38d50423181`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 414–420.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsQuadratic.eq_of_eq_coe {χ : MulChar R ℤ} (hχ : IsQuadratic χ) {χ' : MulChar R' ℤ}
    (hχ' : IsQuadratic χ') [Nontrivial R''] (hR'' : ringChar R'' ≠ 2) {a : R} {a' : R'}
    (h : (χ a : R'') = χ' a') : χ a = χ' a' :=
  Int.cast_injOn_of_ringChar_ne_two hR'' (hχ a) (hχ' a') h

/-- We can post-compose a multiplicative character with a ring homomorphism. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Basic/Variant5252941137868ddc67976122455f259b602eff3beeadefc59e39f2ac12c50b5c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Basic/Variant5252941137868ddc67976122455f259b602eff3beeadefc59e39f2ac12c50b5c.lean#L414).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `164e182669ae5f4557ace7f89a11deef80508f6f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
