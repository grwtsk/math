## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:efa43392-c09f-4943-3142-86250052a3c1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 225–236.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem goldbachFejerDenominatorLowerSum_le_symmetricMajor_re
    (Q N : ℕ) :
    goldbachFejerDenominatorLowerSum Q N ≤
      (goldbachProgressionSymmetricWindowMajorSum Q N).re := by
  rw [goldbachProgressionSymmetricWindowMajorSum_eq_denominatorSum]
  unfold goldbachFejerDenominatorLowerSum
  simp only [Complex.re_sum]
  exact Finset.sum_le_sum fun q hq =>
    goldbachFejerDenominatorLowerTerm_le_block_re hq

/-- Under the inherited safe-scale theorem, the same lower envelope applies to
the actual exact factored progression major source. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Primes/GoldbachFejerBoundary.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Primes/GoldbachFejerBoundary.lean#L225).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7265b7603e55cda94078bfe8bb5b40298c75fdb5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
