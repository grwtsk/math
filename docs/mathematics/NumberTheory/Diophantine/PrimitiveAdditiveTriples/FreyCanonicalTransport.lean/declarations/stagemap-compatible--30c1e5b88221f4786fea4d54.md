## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d10ce201-e79e-1ea5-ff37-2495d113d801`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 116–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem stageMap_compatible (f : R →+* S) (a b r : R) {m n : ℕ} (hmn : m ≤ n) :
    (Ideal.Quotient.factorPow (curveSectionIdeal (f a) (f b) (f r)) hmn).comp
      (stageMap f a b r n) = stageMap f a b r m := by
  apply RingHom.ext
  intro u
  change transition (f a) (f b) (f r) m n hmn
      (powerMap f a b r n (canonicalProjection a b r n u)) =
    powerMap f a b r m (canonicalProjection a b r m u)
  rw [powerMap_transition, canonicalProjection_transition]

/-- Canonical transport is a LIBRARY universal lift from the presented finite
maps. Its construction uses neither toLimit nor the formal-series equivalence. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyCanonicalTransport.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyCanonicalTransport.lean#L116).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2f13d91be2af9c9251c524b813d923d60bd3aa22` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
