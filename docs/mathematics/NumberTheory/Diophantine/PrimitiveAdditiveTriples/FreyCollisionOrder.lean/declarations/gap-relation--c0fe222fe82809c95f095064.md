## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f7437d98-6122-bdf9-2466-161cfe750e6a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 128–138.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem gap_relation (t : PrimitiveAdditiveTriple) (hd : Descends t) (P : PairFrame t) :
    8*P.gap^2-(1+4*(integerModel t).a₂)*P.gap+2*(integerModel t).a₄=0 := by
  obtain ⟨h1,h3,h6⟩ := selected_coefficients t hd
  have he := integer_equation t P.rightLabel

  simp only [Matrix.cons_val_zero,Matrix.cons_val_one,Matrix.cons_val_two,h1,h3,h6] at he
  have hp : P.gap*(8*P.gap^2-(1+4*(integerModel t).a₂)*P.gap+
      2*(integerModel t).a₄)=0 := by linear_combination he
  exact (mul_eq_zero.mp hp).resolve_left P.gap_ne

/-- A literal coordinate-ring relation; the residual cubic factor is not discarded. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyCollisionOrder.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyCollisionOrder.lean#L128).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b75164a279c8b684bd5cb0f6bb7133bbb3d43c27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
