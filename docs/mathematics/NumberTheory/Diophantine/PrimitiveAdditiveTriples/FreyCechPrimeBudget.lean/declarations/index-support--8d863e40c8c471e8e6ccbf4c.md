## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:40ba5757-a026-391e-958e-42adc9d698e5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem index_support (a b : ℤ) (hab : a * b ≠ 0) (k : ℕ) (hk : k ≠ 0) :
    occupied (index a b k) = {2, 3} ∪ occupied (a * b).natAbs := by
  have hh : (a * b).natAbs ≠ 0 := by simpa only [Int.natAbs_eq_zero] using hab
  rw [index, combined_index a b hab k,
    occupied_mul _ _ (pow_ne_zero _ (by norm_num)) (pow_ne_zero _ (pow_ne_zero _ hh)),
    occupied_pow 48 _ (Nat.ne_of_gt (stage_rank_pos k)),
    occupied_pow _ 4 (by norm_num), occupied_pow _ (k * k) (Nat.mul_ne_zero hk hk)]
  have h48 : occupied 48 = {2, 3} := by
    convert twoPow_three_support 4 (by norm_num) using 1 <;> norm_num
  rw [h48]

/-- Grade zero is NOT licensed to inherit prime support from ab. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyCechPrimeBudget.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyCechPrimeBudget.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `65de0ada25121a2c63ef08f21c66384412024dc2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
