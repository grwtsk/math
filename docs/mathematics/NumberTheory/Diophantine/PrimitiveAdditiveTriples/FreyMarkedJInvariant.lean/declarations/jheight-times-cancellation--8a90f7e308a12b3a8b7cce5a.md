## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2cd9439b-fc73-3bf7-4003-23131d7bca90`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 162–174.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem jHeight_times_cancellation (t : PrimitiveAdditiveTriple) :
    jHeight t * (cancellation t : ℚ) = 256*(shape t : ℚ)^3 := by
  have hp : (sourceProduct t : ℚ) ≠ 0 :=
    Nat.cast_ne_zero.mpr (Nat.ne_of_gt t.product_pos)
  have hd : (t.freyCurve.j.den : ℚ) * (cancellation t : ℚ) =
      (sourceProduct t : ℚ)^2 := by exact_mod_cast j_denominator_mul t
  rw [jHeight_eq_den_mul]
  calc
    _ = ((t.freyCurve.j.den : ℚ)*(cancellation t : ℚ))*t.freyCurve.j := by ring
    _ = (sourceProduct t : ℚ)^2 * (256*(shape t : ℚ)^3/(sourceProduct t : ℚ)^2) := by
      rw [hd, curve_j]
    _ = 256*(shape t : ℚ)^3 := by field_simp [hp]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyMarkedJInvariant.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyMarkedJInvariant.lean#L162).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `35e6cef52e446675f7f78ed25cc1ac61514df481` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
