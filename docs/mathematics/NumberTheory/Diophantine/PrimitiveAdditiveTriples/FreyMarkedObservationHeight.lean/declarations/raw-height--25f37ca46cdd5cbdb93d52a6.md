## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:87c050b4-b9b9-ea4e-f2cb-d51d362ac006`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 161–173.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem raw_height (t : PrimitiveAdditiveTriple) :
    height (raw t) = max (t.a : ℚ) (t.b : ℚ) := by
  have hraw : raw t = (fun i => ((![0,(t.a : ℤ),-(t.b : ℤ)] : Fin 3 → ℤ) i : ℚ)) := by
    rw [raw, t.freyAffinePortEval_x]
    funext i; fin_cases i <;> simp
  have hD : denominator (raw t) = 1 := by rw [hraw]; exact denominator_int _
  have ha1 : (1 : ℚ) ≤ t.a := by
    exact_mod_cast Nat.one_le_iff_ne_zero.mpr (Nat.ne_of_gt t.a_pos)
  have h1 : (1 : ℚ) ≤ max (t.a : ℚ) (t.b : ℚ) := ha1.trans (le_max_left _ _)
  rw [height, hD, raw_max, max_eq_right h1]
  simp

/-- Exact raw-to-source comparison, not a mislabeled equality. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyMarkedObservationHeight.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyMarkedObservationHeight.lean#L161).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b97e30744f8bdfc847fbea928d56cfa714958b4f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
