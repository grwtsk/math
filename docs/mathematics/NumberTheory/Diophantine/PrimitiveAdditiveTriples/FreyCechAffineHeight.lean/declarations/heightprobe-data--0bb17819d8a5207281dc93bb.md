## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5d5f2969-093d-e405-7d89-2d661c1025a3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–168.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem heightProbe_data (k : ℕ) :
    denominator (rawCoordinates k (heightProbe k)) = 1 ∧ targetMax k (heightProbe k) = 1 := by
  constructor
  · have he : rawCoordinates k (heightProbe k) =
        (fun s : Slot k => ((![1,0,1,0] : Fin 4 → ℤ) s.2 : ℚ)) := by
      funext s; rcases s with ⟨i,j⟩; fin_cases j <;> simp [rawCoordinates, heightProbe]
    rw [he, denominator_int]
  · apply le_antisymm
    · apply (maxAbs_le_iff _ _).mpr
      rintro ⟨i,j⟩; fin_cases j <;> norm_num [rawCoordinates, heightProbe]
    · have h := entry_le (rawCoordinates k (heightProbe k))
        (Sum.inl ⟨0, Nat.zero_lt_succ k⟩,0)
      simpa [rawCoordinates, heightProbe, targetMax] using h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyCechAffineHeight.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyCechAffineHeight.lean#L155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ca6125fb40ad765b2c5061f856974228c7a5b6b9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
