## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4e94a6e4-0b90-c2f9-6495-27bef4acf36e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 63–81.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem denominator_inverse (a b : ℤ) (hab : a*b ≠ 0) (k : ℕ) (r : RationalData k) :
    denominator (inverseQ a b hab k r) ∣
      FreyCechPrimeBudget.clearing a b k * denominator (rawCoordinates k r) := by
  let D := denominator (rawCoordinates k r)
  have hf : ∀ s : Slot k, ClearsValue D (frameQ k r s) := by
    rintro ⟨i,j⟩
    have hr (c : Fin 4) := denominator_clears (rawCoordinates k r) (i,c)
    fin_cases j
    · exact hr 0
    · exact hr 1
    · exact clears_sub D _ _ (hr 2) (hr 1)
    · exact clears_sub D _ _ (hr 3) (hr 1)
  apply (denominator_dvd_iff_clears _ _).mpr
  intro s

    clears_divisor D (FreyCechPrimeBudget.clearing a b k) (weights a b k s)
      (weights_ne_zero a b hab k s) (column_dvd_clearing a b k s)
      (frameQ k r (permutation k s)) (hf (permutation k s))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyCechAffineHeight.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyCechAffineHeight.lean#L63).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ca6125fb40ad765b2c5061f856974228c7a5b6b9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
