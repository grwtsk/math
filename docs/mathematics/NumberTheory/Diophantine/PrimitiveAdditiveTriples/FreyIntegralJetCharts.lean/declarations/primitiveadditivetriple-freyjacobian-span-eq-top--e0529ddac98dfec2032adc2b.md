## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a10504da-2a7a-6433-50bf-1da860f08117`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–57.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem PrimitiveAdditiveTriple.freyJacobian_span_eq_top
    (t : PrimitiveAdditiveTriple) :
    Ideal.span (Set.range t.freyPortJacobian) = (⊤ : Ideal ℤ) := by
  let I : Ideal ℤ := Ideal.span (Set.range t.freyPortJacobian)
  have hd (i : Fin 3) : t.freyPortJacobian i ∈ I :=
    Ideal.subset_span ⟨i, rfl⟩
  apply Ideal.eq_top_iff_one.mpr
  rw [← t.freyJacobian_partition_one]
  exact I.add_mem
    (I.add_mem (I.mul_mem_left _ (hd 0)) (I.mul_mem_left _ (hd 1)))
    (I.mul_mem_left _ (hd 2))

/-- After any base-ring map, no proper ideal contains all three Jacobians.
Primes are a special case; no field or characteristic assumption is needed. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyIntegralJetCharts.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyIntegralJetCharts.lean#L44).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d0921d583705c3b381c4a4ee70bd5655a2c4c3ae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
