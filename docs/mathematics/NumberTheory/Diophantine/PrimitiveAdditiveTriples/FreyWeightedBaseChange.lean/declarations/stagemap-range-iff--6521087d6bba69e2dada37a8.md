## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2e4a01f7-b593-77db-8cdb-7a91b537adf9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 179–198.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (v : stage (f a) (f b) k) :
    (∃ u, stageMap f a b k u = v) ↔
      ∀ i : Index k, ∃ c : K, f c = (basis (f a) (f b) k).repr v i := by

  · intro h
    let c : Index k → K := fun i => Classical.choose (h i)
    refine ⟨∑ i, c i • basis a b k i, ?_⟩
    apply (basis (f a) (f b) k).repr.injective
    ext i
    rw [stageMap_coordinates]
    have hc : (basis a b k).repr (∑ j, c j • basis a b k j) i = c i := by
      simp [map_sum, Finsupp.single_apply]
    rw [hc]
    exact Classical.choose_spec (h i)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyWeightedBaseChange.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Diophantine/PrimitiveAdditiveTriples/FreyWeightedBaseChange.lean#L179).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b4efc276407b9116651191a1141894eb60702c42` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
