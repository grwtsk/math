## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:50b4d062760b7d784b96321e1f27d8727df4919dad91c2569579796836b51091`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 113–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def TrivialZeroCorrectionSeries : Prop :=
  ∀ x : ℝ, 1 < x →
    HasSum (fun m : ℕ => (x ^ (2 * (m + 1)))⁻¹ / (2 * ((m + 1 : ℕ) : ℝ)))
      (-(1 / 2 : ℝ) * Real.log (1 - (x ^ 2)⁻¹))

/-- The exact arithmetic all-order positivity target, with no premise that zeros lie on the line. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/XiToeplitz/Variant10596a4f49ca7a550a0e2f3b8dc6e14253bf3ad764f58c4c1e84bee31db4f243.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/XiToeplitz/Variant10596a4f49ca7a550a0e2f3b8dc6e14253bf3ad764f58c4c1e84bee31db4f243.lean#L113).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a948422878c679712386f55c18dc80205709163a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
