## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:271ff0d7-986b-6c3b-d11b-3a2263f29a11`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 85–90.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem zeta_sub_one_dvd_intCast_iff {n : ℤ} :
    hζ.toInteger - 1 ∣ (n : 𝓞 K) ↔ (p : ℤ) ∣ n := by
  have h := associated_norm_zeta_sub_one p k hζ
  rw [← Ideal.norm_dvd_iff (h.symm.prime (Nat.prime_iff_prime_int.mp hp.out))]
  exact h.dvd_iff_dvd_left

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Ideal/Variantcee7e98bbac003c2af71218f6d7d808d4ff1464c3425f1e2a5c1b8dc3bb450f6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Ideal/Variantcee7e98bbac003c2af71218f6d7d808d4ff1464c3425f1e2a5c1b8dc3bb450f6.lean#L85).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1a7f19b849fdbfd6c34175328163d2742bd6a5d4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
