## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:de3d19d1-5819-9ca5-f4e7-68a5bc7a991a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 293–311.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem generalized_implies_base_of_member_specialization
    {Index : Type uIndex}
    {BaseZero : Type uBase}
    {Zero : Index → Type uGen}
    {base : ZeroProblem BaseZero}
    {family : ∀ i, ZeroProblem (Zero i)}
    (i0 : Index)
    (specialization : BaseSpecialization base (family i0))
    (hGeneralized : GeneralizedHypothesis family) :
    base.Hypothesis := by
  intro z hz
  exact specialization.reflectsCritical z hz
    (hGeneralized i0 (specialization.embed z)
      (specialization.mapsZero z hz))

/-- Spectral covers from the base problem to every generalized member, together
with an actual generalized member containing the base problem, give a typed
conditional equivalence.  This is stronger than merely assuming an arbitrary
implication between the two propositions. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Farey/DynamicSoficSpectralCover.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Farey/DynamicSoficSpectralCover.lean#L293).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5881a2f2caf1aa0b1ec9267376cecb5895327afe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
