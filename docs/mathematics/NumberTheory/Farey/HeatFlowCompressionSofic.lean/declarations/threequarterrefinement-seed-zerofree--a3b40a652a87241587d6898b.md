## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f905abd6-7844-d452-8bd9-eae00f640629`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 336–345.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ThreeQuarterRefinement.seed_zeroFree
    {Point : Type u} (scheme : ThreeQuarterRefinement Point) :
    ZeroFreeRightOf scheme.realPart scheme.isZero (7 / 8 : ℝ) := by
  simpa only [scheme.seedSevenEighths] using scheme.stageZeroFree 0

/-- If every refinement stage is valid and the boundaries are cofinal above
`3 / 4`, then the strict half-plane to the right of `3 / 4` is zero-free.
This does not exclude a zero on the line `Re(s) = 3 / 4`. The cost field is
not used to manufacture analytic validity; it only records the requested
accounting property. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Farey/HeatFlowCompressionSofic.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Farey/HeatFlowCompressionSofic.lean#L336).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `290757773fe6f295c025287d0d673d9d82c773df` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
