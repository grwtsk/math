## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b9dedc8c-6f11-ee5b-5d09-c60ae6bb0d37`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 220–230.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem periodic_source_word_not_coboundary
    (ω : Schedule) (n : ℕ)
    (hp : shift^[n] ω = ω)
    (hWord : modThreeWord (chronologicalPrefix ω n) ≠ (1 : Mat3)) :
    ¬ IsPureCoboundary shift dualStep :=
  nontrivial_periodic_product_not_coboundary
    shift dualStep n ω hp
    (nontrivial_word_dual_product ω n hWord)

/-- The same true source word is gauge-nontrivial at that periodic
point for EVERY group-valued gauge. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/NumberTheory/Farey/FareyShiftCocycle.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/NumberTheory/Farey/FareyShiftCocycle.lean#L220).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dd4f7acf7caed85dbe5c9b388fe1533e78c97175` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
