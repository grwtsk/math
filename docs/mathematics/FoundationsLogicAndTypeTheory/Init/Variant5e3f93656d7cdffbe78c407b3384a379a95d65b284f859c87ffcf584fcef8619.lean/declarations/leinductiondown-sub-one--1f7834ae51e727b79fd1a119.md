## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cb2df5d5-1b69-9b3c-ffa0-b0d90ac6da1a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 180–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem leInductionDown_sub_one {m : ℤ} {motive : ∀ n, n ≤ m → Sort*} (base : motive m m.le_refl)
    (pred : ∀ n hnm, motive n hnm → motive (n - 1) (by lia)) (n : ℤ) (hnm : n ≤ m) :
    Int.leInductionDown (motive := motive) base pred (n - 1) (by lia) =
      pred n hnm (Int.leInductionDown (motive := motive) base pred n hnm) := by
  rw [Int.leInductionDown, inductionOn'_sub_one hnm]
  rfl

section strongRec

variable {motive : ℤ → Sort*} (lt : ∀ n < m, motive n)
  (ge : ∀ n ≥ m, (∀ k < n, motive k) → motive n)

/-- A strong recursor for `Int` that specifies explicit values for integers below a threshold,
and is analogous to `Nat.strongRec` for integers on or above the threshold. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Init/Variant5e3f93656d7cdffbe78c407b3384a379a95d65b284f859c87ffcf584fcef8619.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Init/Variant5e3f93656d7cdffbe78c407b3384a379a95d65b284f859c87ffcf584fcef8619.lean#L180).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a2b65e2829a5030ca2996142f86850a585101d39` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
