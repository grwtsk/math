## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7324d17e-8a25-ce59-af2a-7ede925a4093`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 391–395.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma dvd_right_iff_eq : (∀ a : ℕ, m ∣ a ↔ n ∣ a) ↔ m = n :=
  ⟨fun h => Nat.dvd_antisymm ((h _).mpr (Nat.dvd_refl _)) ((h _).mp (Nat.dvd_refl _)),
    fun h n => by rw [h]⟩

/-- Two natural numbers are equal if and only if they have the same divisors. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Init/Variantaf9a8b0e0412ab90b9edddd7f47b133cfa2448fc351b6087d98a16ce0fee531b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Init/Variantaf9a8b0e0412ab90b9edddd7f47b133cfa2448fc351b6087d98a16ce0fee531b.lean#L391).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `49daebd5449d0fab8de18608b6d111d57f63a75a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
