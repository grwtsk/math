## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:580a6067fadc35c49e5048bbe0d00e87b9a40f33a41bcb9121269b59778a58f1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 36–45.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class AddGroupWithOne (R : Type u) extends IntCast R, AddMonoidWithOne R, AddGroup R where
  /-- The canonical homomorphism `ℤ → R`. -/
  intCast := Int.castDef
  /-- The canonical homomorphism `ℤ → R` agrees with the one from `ℕ → R` on `ℕ`. -/
  intCast_ofNat : ∀ n : ℕ, intCast (n : ℕ) = Nat.cast n := by intros; rfl
  /-- The canonical homomorphism `ℤ → R` for negative values is just the negation of the values
  of the canonical homomorphism `ℕ → R`. -/
  intCast_negSucc : ∀ n : ℕ, intCast (Int.negSucc n) = - Nat.cast (n + 1) := by intros; rfl

/-- An `AddCommGroupWithOne` is an `AddGroupWithOne` satisfying `a + b = b + a`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Defs/Variant2e5280375c89c0c451b4e6ae2acdf030bc7cb6c9b435c95de49319572554df4e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Defs/Variant2e5280375c89c0c451b4e6ae2acdf030bc7cb6c9b435c95de49319572554df4e.lean#L36).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `76c80036ddf1e525550a3a76f431eec74bd5afa9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
