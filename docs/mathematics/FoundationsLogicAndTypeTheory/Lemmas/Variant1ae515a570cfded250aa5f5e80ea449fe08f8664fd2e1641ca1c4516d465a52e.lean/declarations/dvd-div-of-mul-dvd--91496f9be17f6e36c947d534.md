## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:db6cd590-5463-72a5-d7bf-472cf25b216e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 184–194.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dvd_div_of_mul_dvd {a b c : ℕ} (h : a * b ∣ c) : b ∣ c / a :=
  if ha : a = 0 then by simp [ha]
  else
    have ha : 0 < a := Nat.pos_of_ne_zero ha
    have h1 : ∃ d, c = a * b * d := h
    let ⟨d, hd⟩ := h1
    have h2 : c / a = b * d := Nat.div_eq_of_eq_mul_right ha (by simpa [mul_assoc] using hd)
    show ∃ d, c / a = b * d from ⟨d, h2⟩
#align nat.dvd_div_of_mul_dvd Nat.dvd_div_of_mul_dvd

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Lemmas/Variant1ae515a570cfded250aa5f5e80ea449fe08f8664fd2e1641ca1c4516d465a52e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Lemmas/Variant1ae515a570cfded250aa5f5e80ea449fe08f8664fd2e1641ca1c4516d465a52e.lean#L184).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e925f2aefbbbc40d44a26ea4c5b1ed0a3ae6e79e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
