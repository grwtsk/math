## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3723b2d8c59af1e69a378b98c880bcd75bf6ff283eda2c1333f7bf79e62482d3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 368–381.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance commSemiring : CommSemiring Num where
  __ := Num.addMonoid
  __ := Num.addMonoidWithOne
  npow := @npowRec Num ⟨1⟩ ⟨(· * ·)⟩
  mul_zero := by transfer
  zero_mul := by transfer
  mul_one := by transfer
  one_mul := by transfer
  add_comm := by transfer
  mul_comm := by transfer
  mul_assoc := by transfer
  left_distrib := by transfer
  right_distrib := by transfer

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Lemmas/Variantf5d2775572bd083b56cda9d7e612f342078d14681565cd874105e12e332db297.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Lemmas/Variantf5d2775572bd083b56cda9d7e612f342078d14681565cd874105e12e332db297.lean#L368).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `22c07f1361660c7c8cba5a397cd9c24c63c3210b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
