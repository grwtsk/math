## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f91e2af3-a68f-131f-fcfd-a2b6d2346a56`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 95–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem add_succ : ∀ m n : PosNum, m + succ n = succ (m + n)
  | 1, b => by simp [one_add]
  | bit0 a, 1 => congr_arg bit0 (add_one a)
  | bit1 a, 1 => congr_arg bit1 (add_one a)
  | bit0 _, bit0 _ => rfl
  | bit0 a, bit1 b => congr_arg bit0 (add_succ a b)
  | bit1 _, bit0 _ => rfl
  | bit1 a, bit1 b => congr_arg bit1 (add_succ a b)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Lemmas/Variant39c3341cf3ead6815f3e29867663779b301b383ca930cffb4afc231d84fbc4a8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Lemmas/Variant39c3341cf3ead6815f3e29867663779b301b383ca930cffb4afc231d84fbc4a8.lean#L95).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d1df34599943dc6fffd37bf2255cf8efce0ed244` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
