## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cfd7b70927e66e396ff2a16c9e616b2603fadf3a63a03a640f09508ef8347965`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 366–379.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance commSemiring : CommSemiring Num where
  __ := Num.addMonoid
  __ := Num.addMonoidWithOne
  npow := @npowRec Num ⟨1⟩ ⟨(· * ·)⟩
  mul_zero _ := by rw [← to_nat_inj, mul_to_nat, cast_zero, mul_zero]
  zero_mul _ := by rw [← to_nat_inj, mul_to_nat, cast_zero, zero_mul]
  mul_one _ := by rw [← to_nat_inj, mul_to_nat, cast_one, mul_one]
  one_mul _ := by rw [← to_nat_inj, mul_to_nat, cast_one, one_mul]
  add_comm _ _ := by simp_rw [← to_nat_inj, add_to_nat, add_comm]
  mul_comm _ _ := by simp_rw [← to_nat_inj, mul_to_nat, mul_comm]
  mul_assoc _ _ _ := by simp_rw [← to_nat_inj, mul_to_nat, mul_assoc]
  left_distrib _ _ _ := by simp only [← to_nat_inj, mul_to_nat, add_to_nat, mul_add]
  right_distrib _ _ _ := by simp only [← to_nat_inj, mul_to_nat, add_to_nat, add_mul]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Lemmas/Variant39c3341cf3ead6815f3e29867663779b301b383ca930cffb4afc231d84fbc4a8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Lemmas/Variant39c3341cf3ead6815f3e29867663779b301b383ca930cffb4afc231d84fbc4a8.lean#L366).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d1df34599943dc6fffd37bf2255cf8efce0ed244` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
