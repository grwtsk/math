## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:751bf011-c432-d17e-6d8a-32cf0b5df6f8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 111–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem card_opow_le_of_omega0_le_right (a : Ordinal) {b : Ordinal} (hb : ω ≤ b) :
    (a ^ b).card ≤ max a.card b.card := by
  obtain ⟨n, rfl⟩ | ha := eq_nat_or_omega0_le a
  · apply (card_le_card <| opow_le_opow_left b (nat_lt_omega0 n).le).trans
    apply (card_opow_le_of_omega0_le_left le_rfl _).trans
    simp [hb]
  · exact card_opow_le_of_omega0_le_left ha b

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Ordinal/Variant12c69418acb1a7f999d4a273240f9ab33cdf4f8bf456868dc099361b91c571b4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Ordinal/Variant12c69418acb1a7f999d4a273240f9ab33cdf4f8bf456868dc099361b91c571b4.lean#L111).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c716f0fa8f07ef21309f6c002ec8d96bf90ed6b4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
