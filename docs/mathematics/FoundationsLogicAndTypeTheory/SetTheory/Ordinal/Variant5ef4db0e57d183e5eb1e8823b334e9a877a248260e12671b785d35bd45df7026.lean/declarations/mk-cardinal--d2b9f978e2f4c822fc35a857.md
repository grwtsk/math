## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6f136f79-91fa-1612-1233-6272001d8007`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–164.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mk_cardinal : #Cardinal = univ.{u, u + 1} := by
  simpa only [card_type, card_univ] using congr_arg card type_cardinal
#align cardinal.mk_cardinal Cardinal.mk_cardinal

/-- The `aleph'` function gives the cardinals listed by their ordinal
  index, and is the inverse of `aleph_idx`.
  `aleph' n = n`, `aleph' ω = ω`, `aleph' (ω + 1) = succ ℵ₀`, etc.
  In this version, we register additionally that this function is an order isomorphism
  between ordinals and cardinals.
  For the basic function version, see `aleph'`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Ordinal/Variant5ef4db0e57d183e5eb1e8823b334e9a877a248260e12671b785d35bd45df7026.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Ordinal/Variant5ef4db0e57d183e5eb1e8823b334e9a877a248260e12671b785d35bd45df7026.lean#L155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d113b35b3d19c5d27cea94671fea561b0543b5e9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
