## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ce70ee54c6a5d4d1d61a920af764916e6f2d3820528ef11e8b3c901dff606735`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 229–238.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def shortOfRelabelling : ∀ {x y : PGame.{u}}, Relabelling x y → Short x → Short y
  | x, y, ⟨L, R, rL, rR⟩, S => by
    haveI := Fintype.ofEquiv _ L
    haveI := Fintype.ofEquiv _ R
    exact
      Short.mk'
        (fun i => by rw [← L.right_inv i]; apply shortOfRelabelling (rL (L.symm i)) inferInstance)
        fun j => by simpa using shortOfRelabelling (rR (R.symm j)) inferInstance
#align pgame.short_of_relabelling SetTheory.PGame.shortOfRelabelling

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Short/Variantf8cf9396f1ae0913aaca6cf1b5afbb62445af7748abceb13ee8e57bc8b2f5be5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Short/Variantf8cf9396f1ae0913aaca6cf1b5afbb62445af7748abceb13ee8e57bc8b2f5be5.lean#L229).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `18bbc42ca1dc866f62b38b1d52d595c77a9a6c99` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
