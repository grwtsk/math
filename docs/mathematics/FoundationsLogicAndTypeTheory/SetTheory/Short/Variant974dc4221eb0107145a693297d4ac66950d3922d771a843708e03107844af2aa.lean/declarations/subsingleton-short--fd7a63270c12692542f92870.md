## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4aad94294878b506c61a35d44ea13005d6e4756c3987056c4f163db839f12a22`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–69.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance subsingleton_short (x : PGame) : Subsingleton (Short x) := by
  induction x with
  | mk xl xr xL xR =>
    constructor
    intro a b
    cases a; cases b
    congr!


-- Porting note: We use `induction` to prove `subsingleton_short` instead of recursion.
-- A proof using recursion generates a harder `decreasing_by` goal than in Lean 3 for some reason:
attribute [-instance] subsingleton_short in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Short/Variant974dc4221eb0107145a693297d4ac66950d3922d771a843708e03107844af2aa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Short/Variant974dc4221eb0107145a693297d4ac66950d3922d771a843708e03107844af2aa.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dd1d420166f8d98166edcd38041f6b6c8cd17f8e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
