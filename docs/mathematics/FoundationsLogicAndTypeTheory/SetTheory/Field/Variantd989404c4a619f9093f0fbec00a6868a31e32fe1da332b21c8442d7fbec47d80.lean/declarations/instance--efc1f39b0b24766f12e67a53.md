## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:14ab6953a8c740486550cb2bfa0c8eeaf24245e2c35927a17a9a945933378656`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 231–242.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : CancelMonoidWithZero Nimber where

/-! ### Nimber division -/

mutual

/-- The nimber inverse `a⁻¹` is mutually recursively defined as the smallest nimber not in the set
`s = invSet a`, which itself is defined as the smallest set with `0 ∈ s` and
`(1 + (a + a') * b) / a' ∈ s` for `0 < a' < a` and `b ∈ s`.

This preliminary definition "accidentally" satisfies `invAux 0 = 1`, which the real inverse
corrects. The lemma `inv_eq_invAux` can be used to transfer between the two. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Field/Variantd989404c4a619f9093f0fbec00a6868a31e32fe1da332b21c8442d7fbec47d80.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Field/Variantd989404c4a619f9093f0fbec00a6868a31e32fe1da332b21c8442d7fbec47d80.lean#L231).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `533ffd0fea7755c69c198c4f4679425591c40778` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
