## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c9d8c43-762f-7f69-707a-aeafc0e8fa7c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1200–1206.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cmp_compares : ∀ a b : NONote, (cmp a b).Compares a b
  | ⟨a, ha⟩, ⟨b, hb⟩ => by
    dsimp [cmp]
    have := ONote.cmp_compares a b
    cases h : ONote.cmp a b <;> simp only [h] at this <;> try exact this
    exact Subtype.mk_eq_mk.2 this

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Notation/Variant69b775f51cc65bb0296b00f8b025185422a1f1d65774e8f12c72129fe9bbd854.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Notation/Variant69b775f51cc65bb0296b00f8b025185422a1f1d65774e8f12c72129fe9bbd854.lean#L1200).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `692e1f0dfcfdf482c864ba74037ea03ae863bf1b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
