## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:65f90f4d-467f-7ab9-17d0-71987e625319`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 994–1000.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem fundamentalSequenceProp_inr (o f) :
    FundamentalSequenceProp o (Sum.inr f) ↔
      o.repr.IsLimit ∧
        (∀ i, f i < f (i + 1) ∧ f i < o ∧ (o.NF → (f i).NF)) ∧
        ∀ a, a < o.repr → ∃ i, a < (f i).repr :=
  Iff.rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Notation/Variant91eec0017e531547f0d72bbcec8fb706926352ecc9232b153c366d1c4a566d40.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Notation/Variant91eec0017e531547f0d72bbcec8fb706926352ecc9232b153c366d1c4a566d40.lean#L994).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `97cdb8f9800240a324420c8df10cb8f246eb5a4d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
