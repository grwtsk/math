## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3dc3da5a-4578-ca0c-7eab-9ab283931ff6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 491–496.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isNormal_mul_right {a : Ordinal} (h : 0 < a) : IsNormal (a * ·) := by
  refine .of_succ_lt (fun b ↦ ?_) fun hb ↦ ?_
  · simpa [mul_add_one] using (add_lt_add_iff_left (a * b)).2 h
  · simpa [IsLUB, IsLeast, upperBounds, lowerBounds, mul_le_iff_of_isSuccLimit hb] using
      fun c hc ↦ mul_le_mul_right hc.le a

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Arithmetic/Variant887f9e111feaa1d42572be7b8a47aa81dd9efc09249ac7c84ae18cc7afe30ec4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Arithmetic/Variant887f9e111feaa1d42572be7b8a47aa81dd9efc09249ac7c84ae18cc7afe30ec4.lean#L491).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
