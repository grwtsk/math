## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5191f938-b782-5b03-a136-075f30e3f096`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 154–158.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem EventuallyEqSet.cardinal_iInter {s t : ι → Set α} (hic : #ι < c)
    (h : ∀ i, s i =ᶠ[l] t i) : ⋂ i, s i =ᶠ[l] ⋂ i, t i :=
  (EventuallySubset.cardinal_iInter hic fun i => (h i).subset).antisymm
    (EventuallySubset.cardinal_iInter hic fun i => (h i).symm.subset)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/CardinalInter/Variantd3678dadf47fa375f9bc6e0b95ea1465d25726b10a4b1913d9ffc9eca1b5af0c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/CardinalInter/Variantd3678dadf47fa375f9bc6e0b95ea1465d25726b10a4b1913d9ffc9eca1b5af0c.lean#L154).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ce4af0e653de32b0b7b2bfabd3ec2aa3d7e06c01` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
