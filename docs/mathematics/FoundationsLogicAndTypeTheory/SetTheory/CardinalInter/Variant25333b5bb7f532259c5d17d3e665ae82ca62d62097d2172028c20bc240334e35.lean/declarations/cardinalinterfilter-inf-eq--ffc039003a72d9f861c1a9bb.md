## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:017cf738a68f8ac34f2dc212997055c6220e49c597ebd3b3585a3080842e9002`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 241–250.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance cardinalInterFilter_inf_eq (l₁ l₂ : Filter α) [CardinalInterFilter l₁ c]
    [CardinalInterFilter l₂ c] : CardinalInterFilter (l₁ ⊓ l₂) c := by
  refine ⟨fun S hSc hS => ?_⟩
  choose s hs t ht hst using hS
  replace hs : (⋂ i ∈ S, s i ‹_›) ∈ l₁ := (cardinal_bInter_mem hSc).2 hs
  replace ht : (⋂ i ∈ S, t i ‹_›) ∈ l₂ := (cardinal_bInter_mem hSc).2 ht
  refine mem_of_superset (inter_mem_inf hs ht) (subset_sInter fun i hi => ?_)
  rw [hst i hi]
  apply inter_subset_inter <;> exact iInter_subset_of_subset i (iInter_subset _ _)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/CardinalInter/Variant25333b5bb7f532259c5d17d3e665ae82ca62d62097d2172028c20bc240334e35.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/CardinalInter/Variant25333b5bb7f532259c5d17d3e665ae82ca62d62097d2172028c20bc240334e35.lean#L241).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cb69e5e111b490788e9d62cd20234038a48e9165` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
