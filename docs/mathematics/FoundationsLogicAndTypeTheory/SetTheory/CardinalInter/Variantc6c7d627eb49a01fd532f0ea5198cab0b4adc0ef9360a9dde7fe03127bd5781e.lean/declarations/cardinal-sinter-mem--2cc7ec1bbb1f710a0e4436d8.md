## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b8ad00dd-0a78-be7a-db8e-0883b48a75b8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 56–60.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cardinal_sInter_mem {S : Set (Set α)} [CardinalInterFilter l c] (hSc : #S < c) :
    ⋂₀ S ∈ l ↔ ∀ s ∈ S, s ∈ l := ⟨fun hS _s hs => mem_of_superset hS (sInter_subset_of_mem hs),
  CardinalInterFilter.cardinal_sInter_mem _ hSc⟩

/-- Every filter is a CardinalInterFilter with c = ℵ₀ -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/CardinalInter/Variantc6c7d627eb49a01fd532f0ea5198cab0b4adc0ef9360a9dde7fe03127bd5781e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/CardinalInter/Variantc6c7d627eb49a01fd532f0ea5198cab0b4adc0ef9360a9dde7fe03127bd5781e.lean#L56).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5f21116ef82ec94d70cce99e9442ee7f3a06f0d8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
