## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ac15d036-a9b3-d6ac-69e7-5d2279748127`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1229–1237.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lt_univ {c} : c < univ.{u, u + 1} ↔ ∃ c', c = lift.{u + 1, u} c' :=
  ⟨fun h => by
    have := ord_lt_ord.2 h
    rw [ord_univ] at this
    obtain ⟨o, e⟩ := liftPrincipalSeg.mem_range_of_rel_top (by simpa only [liftPrincipalSeg_top])
    have := card_ord c
    rw [← e, liftPrincipalSeg_coe, ← lift_card] at this
    exact ⟨_, this.symm⟩, fun ⟨_, e⟩ => e.symm ▸ lift_lt_univ _⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Basic/Variant3faaa55c97788db17b9f1ac3d6d02b45c97ee2ead53825892f2886690348e14c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Basic/Variant3faaa55c97788db17b9f1ac3d6d02b45c97ee2ead53825892f2886690348e14c.lean#L1229).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f345e2cd8affcf743aac9ae9e89edaa06a23797b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
