## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bac79e37f571a2f107a0302e0c4bd15950cf0e01f5c026f60c104170beb02ac4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1186–1193.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def enumIso (r : α → α → Prop) [IsWellOrder α r] : Subrel (· < ·) (· < type r) ≃r r :=
  { (typein.principalSeg r).subrelIso with
    toFun := fun x ↦ enum r x.1 x.2
    invFun := fun x ↦ ⟨typein r x, typein_lt_type r x⟩ }
#align ordinal.enum_iso Ordinal.enumIso

/-- The order isomorphism between ordinals less than `o` and `o.out.α`. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Basic/Variantc96518e8889610fee4f7726eec58b51f536e15c110386e9e996fbade58d8cef7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Basic/Variantc96518e8889610fee4f7726eec58b51f536e15c110386e9e996fbade58d8cef7.lean#L1186).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9ba557babeaeb9b7a8102f8396bc55a92dba3650` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
