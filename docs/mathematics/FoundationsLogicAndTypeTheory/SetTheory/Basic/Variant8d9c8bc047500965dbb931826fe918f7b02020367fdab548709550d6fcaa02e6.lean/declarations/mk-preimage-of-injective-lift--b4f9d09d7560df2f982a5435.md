## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d97011ff-e5ac-ed51-36d0-aee78d1ff136`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2278–2285.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mk_preimage_of_injective_lift {α : Type u} {β : Type v} (f : α → β) (s : Set β)
    (h : Injective f) : lift.{v} #(f ⁻¹' s) ≤ lift.{u} #s := by
  rw [lift_mk_le.{0}]
  -- Porting note: Needed to insert `mem_preimage.mp` below
  use Subtype.coind (fun x => f x.1) fun x => mem_preimage.mp x.2
  apply Subtype.coind_injective; exact h.comp Subtype.val_injective
#align cardinal.mk_preimage_of_injective_lift Cardinal.mk_preimage_of_injective_lift

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Basic/Variant8d9c8bc047500965dbb931826fe918f7b02020367fdab548709550d6fcaa02e6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Basic/Variant8d9c8bc047500965dbb931826fe918f7b02020367fdab548709550d6fcaa02e6.lean#L2278).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `402175fd9fd0a65032953aea29302d1f2f0b083c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
