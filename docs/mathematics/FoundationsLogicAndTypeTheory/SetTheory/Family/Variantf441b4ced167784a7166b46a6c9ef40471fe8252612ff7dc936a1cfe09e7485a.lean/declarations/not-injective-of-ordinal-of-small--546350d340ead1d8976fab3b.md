## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6fa84c3c-6b10-47b8-d479-de7647d55bc1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 974–978.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem not_injective_of_ordinal_of_small {α : Type v} [Small.{u} α] (f : Ordinal.{u} → α) :
    ¬Injective f := fun h => not_injective_of_ordinal _ ((equivShrink _).injective.comp h)

/-- The type of ordinals in universe `u` is not `Small.{u}`. This is the type-theoretic analog of
the Burali-Forti paradox. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Family/Variantf441b4ced167784a7166b46a6c9ef40471fe8252612ff7dc936a1cfe09e7485a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Family/Variantf441b4ced167784a7166b46a6c9ef40471fe8252612ff7dc936a1cfe09e7485a.lean#L974).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9a2518d1710bbe13bf4825e2ff3f19df97a57627` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
