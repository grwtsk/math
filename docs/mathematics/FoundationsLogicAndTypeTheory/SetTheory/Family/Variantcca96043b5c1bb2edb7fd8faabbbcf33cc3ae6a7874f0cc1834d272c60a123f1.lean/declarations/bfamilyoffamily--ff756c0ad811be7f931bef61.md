## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:528e2c933d9fa8d528af4204e37965da5c967d074b44aca596c34f2dbfe0e691`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–59.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def bfamilyOfFamily' {ι : Type u} (r : ι → ι → Prop) [IsWellOrder ι r] (f : ι → α) :
    ∀ a < type r, α := fun a ha => f (enum r ⟨a, ha⟩)

/-- Converts a family indexed by a `Type u` to one indexed by an `Ordinal.{u}` using a well-ordering
given by the axiom of choice. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Family/Variantcca96043b5c1bb2edb7fd8faabbbcf33cc3ae6a7874f0cc1834d272c60a123f1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Family/Variantcca96043b5c1bb2edb7fd8faabbbcf33cc3ae6a7874f0cc1834d272c60a123f1.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `64e97358485682fd00f0b272b24006d21d912de7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
