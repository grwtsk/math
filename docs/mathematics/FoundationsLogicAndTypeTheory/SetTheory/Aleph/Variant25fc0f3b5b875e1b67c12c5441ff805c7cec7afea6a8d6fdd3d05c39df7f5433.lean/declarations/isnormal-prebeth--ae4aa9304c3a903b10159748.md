## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c994e43c-787d-7e85-b76d-8703ca5b3c07`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 559–571.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isNormal_preBeth : IsNormal (ord ∘ preBeth) := by
  refine (isNormal_iff_strictMono_limit _).2
    ⟨ord_strictMono.comp preBeth_strictMono, fun o ho a ha ↦ ?_⟩
  rw [comp_apply, preBeth_limit ho.isSuccPrelimit, ord_le]
  exact ciSup_le' fun b => ord_le.1 (ha _ b.2)

/-- The Beth function is defined so that `beth 0 = ℵ₀'`, `beth (succ o) = 2 ^ beth o`, and that for
a limit ordinal `o`, `beth o` is the supremum of `beth a` for `a < o`.

Assuming the generalized continuum hypothesis, which is undecidable in ZFC, we have `ℶ_ o = ℵ_ o`
for all ordinals.

For a version which starts at zero, see `Cardinal.preBeth`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Aleph/Variant25fc0f3b5b875e1b67c12c5441ff805c7cec7afea6a8d6fdd3d05c39df7f5433.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Aleph/Variant25fc0f3b5b875e1b67c12c5441ff805c7cec7afea6a8d6fdd3d05c39df7f5433.lean#L559).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `562414d7e2fc53046083df500e74c865ccfd0a00` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
