## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b69683b442e763842675597cafd8769fedeb8b5f5dee930ec33898fdb6eef457`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 414–423.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def aleph : Ordinal ↪o Cardinal :=
  (OrderEmbedding.addLeft ω).trans preAleph

@[inherit_doc] scoped notation "ℵ_ " => aleph
recommended_spelling "aleph" for "ℵ_" in [aleph, «termℵ_»]

/-- `ℵ₁` is the first uncountable cardinal. -/
scoped notation "ℵ₁" => ℵ_ 1
recommended_spelling "aleph_one" for "ℵ₁" in [«termℵ₁»]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Aleph/Variant0de3d08bfa940e0a13494645e86bb6644963e300ae4bf6cb51f7b594bcc2c332.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Aleph/Variant0de3d08bfa940e0a13494645e86bb6644963e300ae4bf6cb51f7b594bcc2c332.lean#L414).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `05905663d4fe71a45e13dbd78c68297e0dcda427` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
