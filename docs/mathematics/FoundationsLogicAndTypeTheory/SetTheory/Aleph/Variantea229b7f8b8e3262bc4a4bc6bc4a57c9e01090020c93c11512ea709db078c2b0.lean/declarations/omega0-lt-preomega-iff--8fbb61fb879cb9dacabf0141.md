## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7007bde5-61e3-d1fc-9c44-f753b9b207d0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 178–186.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem omega0_lt_preOmega_iff {x : Ordinal} : ω < preOmega x ↔ ω < x := by
  conv_lhs => rw [← preOmega_omega0, preOmega_lt_preOmega]

/-- The `omega` function gives the infinite initial ordinals listed by their ordinal index.
`omega 0 = ω`, `omega 1 = ω₁` is the first uncountable ordinal, and so on.

This is not to be confused with the first infinite ordinal `Ordinal.omega0`.

For a version including finite ordinals, see `Ordinal.preOmega`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Aleph/Variantea229b7f8b8e3262bc4a4bc6bc4a57c9e01090020c93c11512ea709db078c2b0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Aleph/Variantea229b7f8b8e3262bc4a4bc6bc4a57c9e01090020c93c11512ea709db078c2b0.lean#L178).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `80bcc0ce8ba5f4467458abf43d54be3509b994e8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
