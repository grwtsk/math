## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:58a3b9fd-f854-6a9b-9b92-5fef62e5c2bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 116–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem reconstruct_composed_cover {J : Type u} {I : J → Type u}
    (A : Set X) (targets : J → Set X) (C : ∀ j, I j → Set X)
    (htarget : A ⊆ ⋃ j, targets j) (hlocal : ∀ j, targets j ⊆ ⋃ i, C j i) :
    A = ⋃ p : Σ j, I j, A ∩ C p.1 p.2 := by
  apply reconstruct_of_cover
  intro x hx
  obtain ⟨j, hj⟩ := Set.mem_iUnion.mp (htarget hx)
  obtain ⟨i, hi⟩ := Set.mem_iUnion.mp (hlocal j hj)
  exact Set.mem_iUnion.mpr ⟨⟨j, i⟩, hi⟩

/-- An equivalence preserves fragment size without crossing cardinal universes. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Cardinal/Variant181c991d60cc9f374142c4c7a8a579653f22c0e03ad2929130b5ba3c2883ffa4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Cardinal/Variant181c991d60cc9f374142c4c7a8a579653f22c0e03ad2929130b5ba3c2883ffa4.lean#L116).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2502e92cf74a1279d89cca8d278628f8edb783b8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
