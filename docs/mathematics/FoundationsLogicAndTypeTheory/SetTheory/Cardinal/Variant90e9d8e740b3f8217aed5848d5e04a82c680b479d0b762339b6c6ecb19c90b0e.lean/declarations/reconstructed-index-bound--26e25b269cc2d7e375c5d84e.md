## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:61dc5763-5a99-d950-b10e-28850ca332f7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 77–83.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem reconstructed_index_bound {I : Type u} (A : Set X) (C : I → Set X)
    (hcover : A ⊆ ⋃ i, C i) (κ : Cardinal.{u}) (hI : #I < κ) :
    (A = ⋃ i, A ∩ C i) ∧ #I < κ :=
  ⟨reconstruct_of_cover A C hcover, hI⟩

/-- A previously supplied threshold may be enlarged monotonically. This is
about its covering witnesses, not a new existence theorem for revised GCH. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Cardinal/Variant90e9d8e740b3f8217aed5848d5e04a82c680b479d0b762339b6c6ecb19c90b0e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/SetTheory/Cardinal/Variant90e9d8e740b3f8217aed5848d5e04a82c680b479d0b762339b6c6ecb19c90b0e.lean#L77).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `de3615aa257e048d272585e2db475f8cd582bbde` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
