## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c0b515b3-9c4b-29b2-b530-1988a1faf698`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 597–607.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem produced_raw_retention_exact_bytes {objects : List Bytes} {sets : List ReadSet} {raw : List RawRoute}
    {prepared : List Binding} {placeholders : List String} {empty : Nat} {result : Produced}
    (produced : produce objects sets raw prepared placeholders empty = some result)
    {route : RawRoute} (member : route ∈ raw) :
    sourcePayload objects sets route.binding =
      sourcePayload objects sets ⟨3, route.retainedPath, route.binding.area, route.binding.target⟩ := by
  have facts := (produce_spec _ _ _ _ _ _ _).mp produced
  have retained := ((inputCheck_spec _ _ _ _ _).mp facts.1).2.2.1
  obtain ⟨_, index, hs, hp⟩ := retentionCheck_exact retained member
  simp [sourcePayload_slot, hs, hp]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Basic/Variantc3e136aca942a4b260eb827cf20912caabaf267e11d38d0642b69e8ca0d244b3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Basic/Variantc3e136aca942a4b260eb827cf20912caabaf267e11d38d0642b69e8ca0d244b3.lean#L597).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d8650b7ad2218741f0582cf5d422cd1a04864d02` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
