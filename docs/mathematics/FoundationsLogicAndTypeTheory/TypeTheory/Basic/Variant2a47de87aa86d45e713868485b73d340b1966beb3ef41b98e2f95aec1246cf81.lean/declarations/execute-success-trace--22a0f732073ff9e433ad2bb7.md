## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ffd27d92-88dc-5167-d7bb-db331aef91bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 156–164.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem execute_success_trace {State Error Receipt : Type} (host : Host State Error Receipt)
    (rawCount certificateRawCount : Nat) (state final : State) (receipt : Receipt)
    (accepted : (execute host rawCount certificateRawCount state).result = .ok (receipt, final)) :
    (execute host rawCount certificateRawCount state).trace =
      (program rawCount certificateRawCount).map Event.step ++ [.outputs, .receipt receipt] := by
  obtain ⟨prepared, verified, steps, outputs, recorded⟩ := execute_success_exact _ _ _ _ _ _ accepted
  have ordered := runSteps_success_trace host.step (program rawCount certificateRawCount) state prepared steps
  simp [execute, steps, outputs, recorded, ordered]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Basic/Variant2a47de87aa86d45e713868485b73d340b1966beb3ef41b98e2f95aec1246cf81.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Basic/Variant2a47de87aa86d45e713868485b73d340b1966beb3ef41b98e2f95aec1246cf81.lean#L156).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb06c6264e5cbbfbe62633675c97fed1a5e76573` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
