## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:692b7478a778fcb6ff97e793ce1995ccaf27f715107cb0676d559cdb602edf06`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 285–307.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def occurrences (certificate : Value) : Option (List SourceRefinement.Occurrence) := do
  let sets ← readSets certificate
  let source ← sets[0]?
  let rows ← getArray "occurrences" certificate
  allSome (fun row => do
    let origin ← getString "origin" row
    let root ← getString "source_root" row
    let sourceSet ← if origin = "source" then
        if root = source.root then some 0 else none
      else if origin = "preservation" then do
        let candidates := (sets.drop 4).zipIdx |>.filter (fun entry => entry.1.root = root)
        match candidates with
        | [(_, index)] => some (index + 4)
        | _ => none
      else none
    let sourcePath ← getString "source_path" row
    let a ← getString "target_area" row >>= area
    let target ← getString "target" row
    let index ← getNat "object" row
    pure ⟨⟨sourceSet, sourcePath, a, target⟩, index⟩) rows

observed occurrence or output is consulted when constructing these routes. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Basic/Variantb45a1db3ba64dc2a7fb614a83b7af52dc15325569a3daa111f848a8221b5f82b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Basic/Variantb45a1db3ba64dc2a7fb614a83b7af52dc15325569a3daa111f848a8221b5f82b.lean#L285).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b94ff40f11346fd563fcc348adfe864a9941a850` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
