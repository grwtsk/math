## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7ed062f0-b55e-661e-3e87-d11ca99a84e1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–131.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem certificateCheck_spec (expected observed : List ReadSet) (bindings : List Binding)
    (occurrences : List Occurrence) (outputs : List Output) :
    certificateCheck objects expected observed bindings occurrences outputs = true ↔
      (4 ≤ expected.length ∧ ∀ set ∈ expected, canonicalReadSet objects set) ∧
      expected = observed ∧ bindingKeys bindings = completeSourceKeys expected ∧

      (realize objects observed bindings).isSome = true ∧
      coverageCheck objects occurrences outputs = true := by
  simp [certificateCheck, readsetsCheck_spec, and_assoc]

variable {objects sets}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Basic/Variantdea50a7a5847451711b8bbf9a742e7cee6b81bf666f9ae4c29c655eaccee4a7b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Basic/Variantdea50a7a5847451711b8bbf9a742e7cee6b81bf666f9ae4c29c655eaccee4a7b.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b9af39f7bab8929b4020ca69bc8abd01ea6118ac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
