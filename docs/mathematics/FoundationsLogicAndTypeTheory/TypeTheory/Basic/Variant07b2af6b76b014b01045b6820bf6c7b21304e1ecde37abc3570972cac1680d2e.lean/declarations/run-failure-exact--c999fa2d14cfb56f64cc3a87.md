## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a57ba78d-b5d1-3640-ebfa-3d1adc672575`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–110.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem run_failure_exact {State Error : Type} (invoke : Stage → State → Except Error State)
    (steps : List Stage) (state : State) (error : Error)
    (failed : (run invoke steps state).result = .error error) :
    ∃ before stage after reached,
      steps = before ++ stage :: after ∧
      (run invoke before state).result = .ok reached ∧
      invoke stage reached = .error error ∧
      (run invoke steps state).trace = before ++ [stage] := by
  induction steps generalizing state with
  | nil => simp [run] at failed
  | cons stage rest ih =>
      cases called : invoke stage state with
      | error observed =>
          have same : observed = error := by simpa [run, called] using failed
          subst observed
          exact ⟨[], stage, rest, state, rfl, rfl, called, by simp [run, called]⟩
      | ok next =>
          have tail : (run invoke rest next).result = .error error := by
            simpa [run, called] using failed
          obtain ⟨before, failing, after, reached, split, successfulPrefix, failure, trace⟩ := ih next tail
          exact ⟨stage :: before, failing, after, reached, by simp [split],
            by simpa [run, called] using successfulPrefix, failure, by simp [run, called, trace]⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Basic/Variant07b2af6b76b014b01045b6820bf6c7b21304e1ecde37abc3570972cac1680d2e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Basic/Variant07b2af6b76b014b01045b6820bf6c7b21304e1ecde37abc3570972cac1680d2e.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a4d737f94dba23d11ae255b267d2795bd736cad5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
