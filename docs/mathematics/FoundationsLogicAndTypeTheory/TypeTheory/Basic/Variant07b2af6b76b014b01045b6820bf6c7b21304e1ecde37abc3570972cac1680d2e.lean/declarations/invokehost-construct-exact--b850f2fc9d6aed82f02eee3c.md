## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3926a40f-0add-118b-3698-d8db1fa84ff4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 333–347.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem invokeHost_construct_exact {Context Native Error : Type} (host : Host Context Native Error)
    (error : Error) (before after : DriverState Context Native)
    (accepted : invokeHost host error .construct before = .ok after) :
    after.observations = before.observations ∧ after.inventory.context = before.inventory.context ∧
      CaptureConstruction.construct before.observations =
        some ⟨after.inventory.files, after.payloads⟩ := by
  simp only [invokeHost] at accepted
  cases built : CaptureConstruction.construct before.observations with
  | none => simp [built] at accepted
  | some captured =>
      have same : {before with inventory.files := captured.records, payloads := captured.payloads} = after := by
        simpa [built] using accepted
      subst after
      exact ⟨rfl, rfl, by cases captured; rfl⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Basic/Variant07b2af6b76b014b01045b6820bf6c7b21304e1ecde37abc3570972cac1680d2e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Basic/Variant07b2af6b76b014b01045b6820bf6c7b21304e1ecde37abc3570972cac1680d2e.lean#L333).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a4d737f94dba23d11ae255b267d2795bd736cad5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
