## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ecc8af02-a5af-a3b7-7203-98af12abd924`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 243–258.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem slot_of_unique_member {files : List (String × Nat)} {path : String} {object : Nat}
    (unique : (files.map Prod.fst).Nodup) (member : (path, object) ∈ files) :
    slot path files = some object := by
  induction files with
  | nil => simp at member
  | cons head rest ih =>
      rcases head with ⟨headPath, headObject⟩
      have facts := List.nodup_cons.mp unique
      rcases List.mem_cons.mp member with same | member
      · have fields := Prod.mk.inj same
        simp [slot, fields.1, fields.2]
      · have different : path ≠ headPath := by
          intro same
          exact facts.1 (List.mem_map.mpr ⟨(path, object), member, same⟩)
        simp [slot, different, ih facts.2 member]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Basic/Variant810681e6d5ac40eee7780224a9a837de464ff3e0a7a748a30bc299ac39ecfb56.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Basic/Variant810681e6d5ac40eee7780224a9a837de464ff3e0a7a748a30bc299ac39ecfb56.lean#L243).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `105673657fa98ef916163b9ebcf82c6b86211f43` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
