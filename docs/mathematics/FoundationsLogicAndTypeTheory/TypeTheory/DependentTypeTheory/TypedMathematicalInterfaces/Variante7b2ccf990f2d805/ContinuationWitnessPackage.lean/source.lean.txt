ContinuationWitnessPackage — exact individually reviewed dependent data
Attribution: ATTRIBUTION_CLARIFICATION_NEEDED
Issue: https://github.com/grwtsk/math/issues/254
Provisional mathematical ideas and direction: grwtsk contributors.
Provisional composite search, probabilistic symbolic recombination and linearized diffusive computation: OpenAI/Codex.
Cache warming and model sculpting: the countless, often unnamed mathematicians, enthusiasts, and curious minds whose work and questions have helped shape these tools, and who now have new ways to pursue mathematical answers to the endlessly deep question: “Why?”
These are owner-supplied provisional roles; exact contributions and source lineage need clarification.

PMD: 510.0.070.020 dependent type theory (editorial navigation only).
Statements, hypotheses and proof bodies are exact source copies. Original whole-file documentation is retained below and may describe other components.
Only containing namespaces and explicit component imports are changed. Distinct historical representations stay distinct.
Uncompiled; no Lean/Lake invocation, public umbrella admission, geometric provider, or new theorem priority claim.

/- Whole dependent witness package with the exact old AnalyticContinuationMap parameter, supplied QuasiIsomorphism and its named predicate witness. The predicate is chosen data in the provider; no cohomology isomorphism or analytic continuation construction is proved. Original namespaces and literal historical imports remain exact and unresolved; labels do not activate mathematical providers. No stronger construction, acceptance or theorem priority is asserted. -/
