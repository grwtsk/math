## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d587f40aabe798f967dcc706111d9241e10f65b33cca8671380912bbfa60eaad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def sourceState (source : CanonicalSource) :
    BooleanState SequentialPrimeCarrierAddress := by
  classical
  exact fun address =>
    if byteField : address.specification = byteSpecification then
      if coordinateBound : CoordinateFiber.mixedRadix address.coordinate < 8 then
        if byteBound : address.occurrence < source.utf8.size then
          byteBitMSB source.utf8[address.occurrence]
            ⟨CoordinateFiber.mixedRadix address.coordinate, coordinateBound⟩
        else false
      else false
    else if lengthField : address.specification = lengthSpecification then
      decide (CoordinateFiber.mixedRadix address.coordinate = 0 ∧
        address.occurrence < source.utf8.size)
    else if relationField : address.specification = relationSpecification then
      incidenceBit source.utf8.size address.occurrence
        (CoordinateFiber.mixedRadix address.coordinate)
    else false

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/DependentTypeTheory/DependentFunctions/SequentialPrimeCanonicalSourceEncoding/Variantfbf782fb31be88b3/SourceStatePlacementAndRecovery.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/DependentTypeTheory/DependentFunctions/SequentialPrimeCanonicalSourceEncoding/Variantfbf782fb31be88b3/SourceStatePlacementAndRecovery.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b272b47a87ea814fda70c121e9bc17343805bc5d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
