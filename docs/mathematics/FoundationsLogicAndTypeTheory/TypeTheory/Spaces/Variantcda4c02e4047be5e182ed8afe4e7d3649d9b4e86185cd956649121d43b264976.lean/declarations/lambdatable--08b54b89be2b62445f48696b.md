## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9f2af4b46bd06a674beade4af09d960d2fbd57fcfe1343383e84f2eb84735053`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 674–685.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def lambdaTable (base : B)
    (body : Frame Q V (Plus Q V B O) → Minus Q V B O)
    (exit : Frame Q V (Plus Q V B O) → O) : Table Q V B O (Plus Q V B O) where
  continuing
    | [] => base
    | a :: as => (behavior Q V B O (body a)).continuing as
  exiting
    | ([], a) => exit a
    | (a :: as, e) => (behavior Q V B O (body a)).exiting (as, e)

/-- The representability step at a minus lambda. The finite level is uniform
across *all* first frames and all stack lengths, not a pointwise bound. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Spaces/Variantcda4c02e4047be5e182ed8afe4e7d3649d9b4e86185cd956649121d43b264976.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Spaces/Variantcda4c02e4047be5e182ed8afe4e7d3649d9b4e86185cd956649121d43b264976.lean#L674).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e7cea4a099f7bacda11013abf1af10a9d20575c3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
