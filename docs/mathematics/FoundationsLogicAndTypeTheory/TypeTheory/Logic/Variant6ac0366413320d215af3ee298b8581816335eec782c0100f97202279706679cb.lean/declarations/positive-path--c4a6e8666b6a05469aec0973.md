## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:03657f4c-6d03-f986-9655-29b3dd41cc80`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1012–1027.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem positive_path (h : Formed L I J R) (hp : PositivePath (PrimaryEdge P) J K) :
    ∃ R', Formed L I K (b := b) R' := by
  induction hp with
  | refl => exact ⟨R,h⟩
  | tail hp he ih =>
    obtain ⟨R',hR'⟩ := ih
    cases he with
    | inclusion _ _ hsub => exact ⟨R',hR'.inclusion hsub.1⟩
    | codomain ht => exact ⟨_,hR'.positive ht⟩
end

variable {Γ : List (Expr S)} {γ : Nat → Mode} {C : Set (Set S)}
    {L : LogicSetup P Γ γ C} {I J : Set S} {b : Bool} {R : DataWrapper S b}

/-- Uniform typing includes all future raw input types, so negative-edge
callbacks are checked under their fresh data variable without a closure axiom. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Logic/Variant6ac0366413320d215af3ee298b8581816335eec782c0100f97202279706679cb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Logic/Variant6ac0366413320d215af3ee298b8581816335eec782c0100f97202279706679cb.lean#L1012).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c14a57b3b335d3f67616d43e8351cfac43f7aa42` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
