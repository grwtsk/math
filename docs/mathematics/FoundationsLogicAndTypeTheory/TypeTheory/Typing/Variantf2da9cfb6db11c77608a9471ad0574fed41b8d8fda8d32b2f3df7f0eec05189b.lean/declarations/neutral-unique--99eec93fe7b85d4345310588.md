## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a0f42477-3bf9-e7e2-f321-6f6c51e16ac8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 636–656.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem neutral_unique {M A B : Expr S} (hn : Neutral M)
    (hA : HasType P Γ M A) (hB : HasType P Γ M B) : Converts A B := by
  induction hn generalizing A B with
  | var n =>
      obtain ⟨D, hD, hcD⟩ := hA.generation
      obtain ⟨E, hE, hcE⟩ := hB.generation
      have heq : D = E := by
        clear hA hB hcD hcE
        induction hD generalizing E with
        | zero A Γ => cases hE; rfl
        | succ C hD ih =>
            cases hE with
            | succ _ hE => exact congrArg (Expr.rename Nat.succ) (ih _ hE)
      subst E
      exact .trans _ _ _ hcD (.symm _ _ hcE)
  | @app f a hn ih =>
      obtain ⟨D, E, hf, ha, hc⟩ := hA.generation_app
      obtain ⟨D', E', hf', ha', hc'⟩ := hB.generation_app
      have he := (ih hf hf').product_compatibility.2
      exact .trans _ _ _ hc (.trans _ _ _ (he.subst (Expr.single a)) (.symm _ _ hc'))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Typing/Variantf2da9cfb6db11c77608a9471ad0574fed41b8d8fda8d32b2f3df7f0eec05189b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/Typing/Variantf2da9cfb6db11c77608a9471ad0574fed41b8d8fda8d32b2f3df7f0eec05189b.lean#L636).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b1aac2e2cc1347f188c35dfd6eea1f338d9a6cde` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
