## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cfdb94f7aebe60e5f70501f703c9bded80a6c1ca8b2f27030b10622890cf6ea0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1141–1147.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example {State Error : Type} (host : Operation → State → Except Error State)
    (directories writes : Nat) (state final : State)
    (accepted : (execute host directories writes state).result = .ok final) :
    (execute host directories writes state).trace[directories + writes + 1]? = some ⟨.readback, 0⟩ ∧
      (execute host directories writes state).trace[directories + writes + 2]? = some ⟨.certificate, 0⟩ :=
  execute_success_mandatory_readback host directories writes state final accepted

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/PipelineConcreteHostContracts/Variantc036a095191b277cc357faf7550ee858519de3cdeac978550133e53868347a07.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/TypeTheory/PipelineConcreteHostContracts/Variantc036a095191b277cc357faf7550ee858519de3cdeac978550133e53868347a07.lean#L1141).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `425d294ed3e432d44204057ef5f9df083b15d67e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
