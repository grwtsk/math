## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:727fce9dc03380e293c564c66c798e0e49b0561c0398138ab3c06cf77e945d7c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–108.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def NamingSquare.bottomEdge (square : NamingSquare) : NamingEdge where
  source := square.afterVertical
  target := square.finish
  kind := square.horizontalKind
  actor := .reconciler
  inputDigest := square.afterVertical.canonicalIrDigest
  outputDigest := square.finish.canonicalIrDigest
  recordedDelta := NameFeatureVector.sub square.finish.features square.afterVertical.features

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/A82c7e19a94fed8eb/Variant89948592d5cc999a39f45c3c351b64b1069ee1ecb5d5660836102cd7ec8e8344.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/A82c7e19a94fed8eb/Variant89948592d5cc999a39f45c3c351b64b1069ee1ecb5d5660836102cd7ec8e8344.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `67e519975f3d85ed5b39144901c0d9eac302a60f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
