## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:586855c83065d3e1951129316ede4f3ec23ffe96ef5607a6199dcedb95543dfd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 312–327.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def mkEncodableInstanceCmds (ctx : Deriving.Context) (typeNames : Array Name)
    (toSFunNames fromSFunNames : Array Name) : TermElabM (Array Command) := do
  let mut instances := #[]
  for i in [:ctx.typeInfos.size] do
    let indVal       := ctx.typeInfos[i]!
    if typeNames.contains indVal.name then
      let auxFunName   := ctx.auxFunNames[i]!
      let argNames     ← mkInductArgNames indVal
      let binders      ← mkImplicitBinders argNames
      let binders      := binders ++ (← mkInstImplicitBinders ``Encodable indVal argNames)
      let indType      ← mkInductiveApp indVal argNames
      let type         ← `($(mkCIdent ``Encodable) $indType)
      let encode       := mkIdent toSFunNames[i]!
      let decode       := mkIdent fromSFunNames[i]!
      let kencode      := mkIdent auxFunName

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DeriveEncodable/Variant0a92ee0d9e951868ccff260fdf5c78646903e7e9b2f7a478677930b31fc0580f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DeriveEncodable/Variant0a92ee0d9e951868ccff260fdf5c78646903e7e9b2f7a478677930b31fc0580f.lean#L312).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `69ba2ac847aa8d122dfda59cb45ae29113032eae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
