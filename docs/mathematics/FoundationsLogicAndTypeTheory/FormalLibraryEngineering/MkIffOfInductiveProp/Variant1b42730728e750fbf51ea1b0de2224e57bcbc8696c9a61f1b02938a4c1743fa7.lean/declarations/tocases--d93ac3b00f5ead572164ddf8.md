## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e63c090ab18c5a3cae204714f6841bd8c6ad29f04bb19e44fb28032d36abbed7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 196–216.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toCases (mvar : MVarId) (shape : List Shape) : MetaM Unit :=
do
  let ⟨h, mvar'⟩ ← mvar.intro1
  let subgoals ← mvar'.cases h
  let _ ← (shape.zip subgoals.toList).enum.mapM fun ⟨p, ⟨⟨shape, t⟩, subgoal⟩⟩ ↦ do
    let vars := subgoal.fields
    let si := (shape.zip vars.toList).filterMap (λ ⟨c,v⟩ => if c then some v else none)
    let mvar'' ← select p (subgoals.size - 1) subgoal.mvarId
    match t with
    | none => do
      let v := vars.get! (shape.length - 1)
      let mv ← mvar''.existsi (List.init si)
      mv.assign v
    | some n => do
      let mv ← mvar''.existsi si
      splitThenConstructor mv (n - 1)
  pure ()

/-- Calls `cases` on `h` (assumed to be a binary sum) `n` times, and returns
the resulting subgoals and their corresponding new hypotheses.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MkIffOfInductiveProp/Variant1b42730728e750fbf51ea1b0de2224e57bcbc8696c9a61f1b02938a4c1743fa7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MkIffOfInductiveProp/Variant1b42730728e750fbf51ea1b0de2224e57bcbc8696c9a61f1b02938a4c1743fa7.lean#L196).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f2d32632fd7a4eb1a9e6cdd00cec0d9bf672693f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
