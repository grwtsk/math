## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `syntax` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:35b3e2cff6f5f55a35b34eb0211f3be96a9d7bdee25020d7e4f664a3d36a588a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 384–404.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
syntax (name := mkIff) "mk_iff" (ppSpace ident)? : attr

/--
`mk_iff_of_inductive_prop i r` makes an `iff` rule for the inductively-defined proposition `i`.
The new rule `r` has the shape `∀ps is, i as ↔ ⋁_j, ∃cs, is = cs`, where `ps` are the type
parameters, `is` are the indices, `j` ranges over all possible constructors, the `cs` are the
parameters for each of the constructors, and the equalities `is = cs` are the instantiations for
each constructor for each of the indices to the inductive type `i`.

In each case, we remove constructor parameters (i.e. `cs`) when the corresponding equality would
be just `c = i` for some index `i`.

For example, `mk_iff_of_inductive_prop` on `List.Chain` produces:

```lean
∀ { α : Type*} (R : α → α → Prop) (a : α) (l : List α),
  Chain R a l ↔ l = [] ∨ ∃(b : α) (l' : List α), R a b ∧ Chain R b l ∧ l = b :: l'
```

See also the `mk_iff` user attribute.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MkIffOfInductiveProp/Variant1b42730728e750fbf51ea1b0de2224e57bcbc8696c9a61f1b02938a4c1743fa7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MkIffOfInductiveProp/Variant1b42730728e750fbf51ea1b0de2224e57bcbc8696c9a61f1b02938a4c1743fa7.lean#L384).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f2d32632fd7a4eb1a9e6cdd00cec0d9bf672693f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
