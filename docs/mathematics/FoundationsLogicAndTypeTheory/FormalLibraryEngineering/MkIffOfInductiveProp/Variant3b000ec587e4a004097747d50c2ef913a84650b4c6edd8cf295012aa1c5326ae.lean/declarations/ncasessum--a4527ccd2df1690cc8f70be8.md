## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1754187a41d4a43949773a77611f6522c1473ca8559d7fd003c4a093627899d4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 219–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def nCasesSum (n : Nat) (mvar : MVarId) (h : FVarId) : MetaM (List (FVarId × MVarId)) :=
match n with
| 0 => pure [(h, mvar)]
| n' + 1 => do
  let #[sg1, sg2] ← mvar.cases h | throwError "expected two case subgoals"
  let #[Expr.fvar fvar1] ← pure sg1.fields | throwError "expected fvar"
  let #[Expr.fvar fvar2] ← pure sg2.fields | throwError "expected fvar"
  let rest ← nCasesSum n' sg2.mvarId fvar2
  pure ((fvar1, sg1.mvarId)::rest)

/-- Calls `cases` on `h` (assumed to be a binary product) `n` times, and returns
the resulting subgoal and the new hypotheses.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MkIffOfInductiveProp/Variant3b000ec587e4a004097747d50c2ef913a84650b4c6edd8cf295012aa1c5326ae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MkIffOfInductiveProp/Variant3b000ec587e4a004097747d50c2ef913a84650b4c6edd8cf295012aa1c5326ae.lean#L219).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `347ac836871184a96643b8e7844ccad55c05d801` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
