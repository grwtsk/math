## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:44b1fa8d1417c65e1553668d9ae0fee6e7691b4b7f9a92914e2557db196f570e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 259–302.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toInductive (mvar : MVarId) (cs : List Name)
    (gs : List Expr) (s : List Shape) (h : FVarId) :
    MetaM Unit := do
  match s.length with
  | 0       => do let _ ← mvar.cases h
                  pure ()
  | (n + 1) => do
      let subgoals ← nCasesSum n mvar h
      let _ ← (cs.zip (subgoals.zip s)).mapM fun ⟨constr_name, ⟨h, mv⟩, bs, e⟩ ↦ do
        let n := (bs.filter id).length
        let (mvar', _fvars) ← match e with
        | none => nCasesProd (n-1) mv h
        | some 0 => do let ⟨mvar', fvars⟩ ← nCasesProd n mv h
                          let mvar'' ← mvar'.tryClear fvars.getLast!
                          pure ⟨mvar'', fvars⟩
        | some (e + 1) => do
           let (mv', fvars) ← nCasesProd n mv h
           let lastfv := fvars.getLast!
           let (mv2, fvars') ← nCasesProd e mv' lastfv

           /- `fvars'.foldlM subst mv2` fails when we have dependent equalities (`HEq`).
           `subst` will change the dependent hypotheses, so that the `uniq` local names
           are wrong afterwards. Instead we revert them and pull them out one-by-one. -/
           let (_, mv3) ← mv2.revert fvars'.toArray
           let mv4 ← fvars'.foldlM (fun mv _ ↦ do let ⟨fv, mv'⟩ ← mv.intro1; subst mv' fv) mv3
           pure (mv4, fvars)
        mvar'.withContext do
          let fvarIds := (← getLCtx).getFVarIds.toList
          let gs := fvarIds.take gs.length
          let hs := (fvarIds.reverse.take n).reverse
          let m := gs.map some ++ listBoolMerge bs hs
          let args ← m.mapM fun a ↦
            match a with
            | some v => pure (mkFVar v)
            | none => mkFreshExprMVar none
          let c ← mkConstWithFreshMVarLevels constr_name
          let e := mkAppN c args.toArray
          let t ← inferType e
          let mt ← mvar'.getType
          let _ ← isDefEq t mt -- infer values for those mvars we just made
          mvar'.assign e

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MkIffOfInductiveProp/Variant3b000ec587e4a004097747d50c2ef913a84650b4c6edd8cf295012aa1c5326ae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MkIffOfInductiveProp/Variant3b000ec587e4a004097747d50c2ef913a84650b4c6edd8cf295012aa1c5326ae.lean#L259).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `347ac836871184a96643b8e7844ccad55c05d801` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
