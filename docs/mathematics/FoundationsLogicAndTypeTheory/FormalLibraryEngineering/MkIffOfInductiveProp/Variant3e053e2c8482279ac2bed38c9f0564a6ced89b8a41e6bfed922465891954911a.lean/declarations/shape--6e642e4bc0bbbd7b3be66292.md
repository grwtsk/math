## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ec2292ae2fbacca9fd050121251b888cf0efc923783c4f70af77cc47d2059af1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 111–139.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
structure Shape : Type where
  /-- For each forall-bound variable in the type of the constructor, minus
  the "params" that apply to the entire inductive type, this list contains `true`
  if that variable has been kept after `compactRelation`.

  For example, `List.Chain.nil` has type
  ```lean
    ∀ {α : Type u_1} {R : α → α → Prop} {a : α}, List.Chain R a []`
  ```
  and the first two variables `α` and `R` are "params", while the `a : α` gets
  eliminated in a `compactRelation`, so `variablesKept = [false]`.

  `List.Chain.cons` has type
  ```lean
    ∀ {α : Type u_1} {R : α → α → Prop} {a b : α} {l : List α},
       R a b → List.Chain R b l → List.Chain R a (b :: l)
  ```
  and the `a : α` gets eliminated, so `variablesKept = [false,true,true,true,true]`.
  -/
  variablesKept : List Bool

  /-- The number of equalities, or `none` in the case when we've reduced something
  of the form `p ∧ True` to just `p`.
  -/
  neqs : Option Nat

/-- Converts an inductive constructor `c` into a `Shape` that will be used later in
while proving the iff theorem, and a proposition representing the constructor.
-/
````

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MkIffOfInductiveProp/Variant3e053e2c8482279ac2bed38c9f0564a6ced89b8a41e6bfed922465891954911a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MkIffOfInductiveProp/Variant3e053e2c8482279ac2bed38c9f0564a6ced89b8a41e6bfed922465891954911a.lean#L111).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `29d6a8a6ab72285803b21b0ae32a857ccee460fe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
