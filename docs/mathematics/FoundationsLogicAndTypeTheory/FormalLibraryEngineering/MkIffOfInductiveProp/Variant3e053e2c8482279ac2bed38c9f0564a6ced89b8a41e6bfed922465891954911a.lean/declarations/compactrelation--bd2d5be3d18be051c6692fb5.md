## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5b7637248388dd450eadbcff304b50c4abecaf55c442ee490714f12e85658f49`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–71.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def compactRelation :
    List Expr → List (Expr × Expr) → List (Option Expr) × List (Expr × Expr) × (Expr → Expr)
| [],    as_ps => ([], as_ps, id)
| b::bs, as_ps =>
  match as_ps.span (fun ⟨_, p⟩ ↦ p != b) with
    | (_, []) => -- found nothing in ps equal to b
      let (bs, as_ps', subst) := compactRelation bs as_ps
      (b::bs, as_ps', subst)
    | (ps₁, (a, _) :: ps₂) => -- found one that matches b. Remove it.
      let i := fun e ↦ e.replaceFVar b a
      let (bs, as_ps', subst) :=
        compactRelation (bs.map i) ((ps₁ ++ ps₂).map (fun ⟨a, p⟩ ↦ (a, i p)))
      (none :: bs, as_ps', i ∘ subst)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MkIffOfInductiveProp/Variant3e053e2c8482279ac2bed38c9f0564a6ced89b8a41e6bfed922465891954911a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MkIffOfInductiveProp/Variant3e053e2c8482279ac2bed38c9f0564a6ced89b8a41e6bfed922465891954911a.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `29d6a8a6ab72285803b21b0ae32a857ccee460fe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
