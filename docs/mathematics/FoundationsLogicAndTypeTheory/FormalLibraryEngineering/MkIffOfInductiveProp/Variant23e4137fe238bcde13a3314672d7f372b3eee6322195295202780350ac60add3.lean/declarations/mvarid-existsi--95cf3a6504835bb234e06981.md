## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5eecc3258c85b278f3281e1ec43d4f6619f53caf852a335a9df4e1641bad42d7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 35–48.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def MVarId.existsi (mvar : MVarId) (es : List Expr) : MetaM MVarId := do
  es.foldlM (fun mv e ↦ do
      let (subgoals,_) ← Elab.Term.TermElabM.run <| Elab.Tactic.run mv do
        Elab.Tactic.evalTactic (← `(tactic| refine ⟨?_,?_⟩))
      let [sg1, sg2] := subgoals | throwError "expected two subgoals"
      sg1.assign e
      pure sg2)
    mvar

/--
Apply the `n`-th constructor of the target type,
checking that it is an inductive type,
and that there are the expected number of constructors.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MkIffOfInductiveProp/Variant23e4137fe238bcde13a3314672d7f372b3eee6322195295202780350ac60add3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MkIffOfInductiveProp/Variant23e4137fe238bcde13a3314672d7f372b3eee6322195295202780350ac60add3.lean#L35).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `69231d1701ca08e19c15c06fd8a26d085c5ffec3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
