## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `opaque` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c29caf74916341bbbe362c628d7006c22a0b4206c997a9ffefb99f5fd6741bca`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1460–1471.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
opaque instantiateRev (e : @& Expr) (subst : @& Array Expr) : Expr

/--
Similar to `Lean.Expr.instantiate`, but considers only the substitutions `subst` in the range `[beginIdx, endIdx)`.
Function panics if `beginIdx <= endIdx <= subst.size` does not hold.

This function is equivalent to `instantiate e (subst.extract beginIdx endIdx)`, but it does not allocate a new array.

This instantiates with the "backwards" indexing scheme.
See also `Lean.Expr.instantiateRevRange`, which instantiates with the "forwards" indexing scheme.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Expr/Variantb9a91d9d170201c2a3622b9c55d694466f54e0e1b8f6068a2d296ff98650169c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Expr/Variantb9a91d9d170201c2a3622b9c55d694466f54e0e1b8f6068a2d296ff98650169c.lean#L1460).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6aeb819ba60e92ed5f325b2f594f3ed610845e38` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
