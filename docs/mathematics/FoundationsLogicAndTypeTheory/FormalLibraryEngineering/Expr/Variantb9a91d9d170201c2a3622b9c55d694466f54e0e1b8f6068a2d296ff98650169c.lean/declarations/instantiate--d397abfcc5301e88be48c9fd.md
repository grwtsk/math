## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `opaque` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:48c1beefdcf23c815a9923fb128b5e52feb19dad719ffe7cabe303dd2130b957`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1429–1445.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
opaque instantiate (e : @& Expr) (subst : @& Array Expr) : Expr

/--
Instantiates loose bound variable `0` in `e` using the expression `subst`,
where in particular a loose `Expr.bvar i` at binding depth `d` is instantiated with `subst` if `i = d`,
and otherwise it is replaced with `Expr.bvar (i - 1)`; non-loose bound variables are not touched.

If we imagine all expressions as being able to refer to the infinite list of loose bound variables ..., 3, 2, 1, 0 in that order,
then conceptually `instantiate1` is instantiating the last one of these and reindexing the remaining ones.

This function is equivalent to `instantiate e #[subst]`, but it avoids allocating an array.

See the documentation for `Lean.Expr.instantiate` for a description of instantiation.
In short, during instantiation the loose bound variables in `subst` have their own de Bruijn indices updated to account
for the binding depth of the replaced loose bound variable.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Expr/Variantb9a91d9d170201c2a3622b9c55d694466f54e0e1b8f6068a2d296ff98650169c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Expr/Variantb9a91d9d170201c2a3622b9c55d694466f54e0e1b8f6068a2d296ff98650169c.lean#L1429).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6aeb819ba60e92ed5f325b2f594f3ed610845e38` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
