## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:83ad7b5f5314ac46d4d48b8bae8b81453f141f3a1b35ca1793d0c7c6897e3498`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 138–148.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def upwardAndElim (up : SimpTheorems) (e : Expr) : SimpM Simp.Step := do
  let r ← Simp.rewrite? e up.post up.erased prove (tag := "squash") (rflOnly := false)
  let r := r.getD { expr := e }
  let r ← mkEqTrans r <|← splittingProcedure r.expr
  if r.expr == e then return Simp.Step.done {expr := e}
  return Simp.Step.visit r

/--
If possible, rewrite `(n : α)` to `(Nat.cast n : α)` where `n` is a numeral and `α ≠ ℕ`.
Returns a pair of the new expression and proof that they are equal.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/NormCast/Variant0ac2bea8dd09fd95a641dac5b9dad34ed8501fcb2dec833c25e956e1954d02bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/NormCast/Variant0ac2bea8dd09fd95a641dac5b9dad34ed8501fcb2dec833c25e956e1954d02bd.lean#L138).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e8944601062dd50a840761e2fc375a1e3ea0541c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
