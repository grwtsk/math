## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3a4f6fcd55413544f8ffe44f57e3933c356de8da6094f3de2a3be5e228b6b3ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 23–55.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public def findSpec (database : SpecTheorems) (wp : Expr) : MetaM SpecTheorem := do
  let_expr WP.wp _m _ps _instWP _α prog := wp | throwError "target not a wp application {wp}"
  let prog ← instantiateMVarsIfMVarApp prog
  let prog := prog.headBeta
  let candidates ← database.specs.getMatch prog
  let candidates := candidates.filter fun spec => !database.erased.contains spec.proof
  let candidates := candidates.insertionSort fun s₁ s₂ => s₁.priority > s₂.priority
  trace[Elab.Tactic.Do.spec] "Candidates for {prog}: {candidates.map (·.proof)}"
  let specs ← candidates.filterM fun spec => do
    let (_, _, _, type) ← spec.proof.instantiate
    -- Reduce reducible abbreviations so a proof whose type is an abbreviation like
    -- `abbrev s := ⦃P⦄ prog ⦃Q⦄` is recognized as a triple spec.
    let type ← whnfR type
    trace[Elab.Tactic.Do.spec] "{spec.proof} instantiates to {type}"
    let_expr c@Triple m ps instWP α specProg _P _Q := type | throwError "Not a triple: {type}"
    let check := isDefEqGuarded wp (mkApp5 (mkConst ``WP.wp c.constLevels!) m ps instWP α specProg)
    let b ← check
    unless b do
      -- Instantiation for this spec failed. When tracing is enabled, we want to see fine-grained
      -- information why the defeq check failed, so we do it again.
      withOptions (fun o =>
        if o.getBool `trace.Elab.Tactic.Do.spec then
          o |>.set `pp.universes true
            |>.set `trace.Meta.isDefEq true
        else
          o) do
      withTraceNode `Elab.Tactic.Do.spec (fun _ => return m!"Defeq check for {type} failed.") do
      discard <| check
    return b
  trace[Elab.Tactic.Do.spec] "Specs for {prog}: {specs.map (·.proof)}"
  if specs.isEmpty then throwError m!"No specs found for {indentExpr prog}\nCandidates: {candidates.map (·.proof)}"
  return specs[0]!

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Spec/Variant4830a0b262c3773909ecc88818a4ce8da4c40c63fbddb05375377bc7c2c263ad.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Spec/Variant4830a0b262c3773909ecc88818a4ce8da4c40c63fbddb05375377bc7c2c263ad.lean#L23).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ed4cee461e180cd263668c196adeeafb35cde0a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
