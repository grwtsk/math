## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4c3569bd70ff2ae00358b3485f5ff8c2bf64c4fa80b56a5453e16a8d81cfa712`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 376–407.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def createLeanActionWorkflow (dir : FilePath) (tmp : InitTemplate) : LogIO PUnit := do
  logVerbose "creating lean-action CI workflow"
  let workflowDir := dir / ".github" / "workflows"
  IO.FS.createDirAll workflowDir

  let workflowFile := workflowDir / "lean_action_ci.yml"
  if (← workflowFile.pathExists) then
    logVerbose "lean-action CI workflow already exists"
    return
  if tmp = .math then
    IO.FS.writeFile workflowFile mathBuildActionWorkflowContents
  else
    IO.FS.writeFile workflowFile leanActionWorkflowContents
  logVerbose s!"created lean-action CI workflow at '{workflowFile}'"

  if tmp = .math then
    -- A workflow for automatically creating update PRs/issues.
    let workflowFile := workflowDir / "update.yml"
    if (← workflowFile.pathExists) then
      logVerbose "Mathlib update CI workflow already exists"
      return
    IO.FS.writeFile workflowFile mathUpdateActionWorkflowContents
    logVerbose s!"created Mathlib update CI workflow at '{workflowFile}'"
    -- A workflow for tagging commits that bump the Lean toolchain version.
    let workflowFile := workflowDir / "create-release.yml"
    if (← workflowFile.pathExists) then
      logVerbose "create-release CI workflow already exists"
      return
    IO.FS.writeFile workflowFile createReleaseActionWorkflowContents
    logVerbose s!"created create-release CI workflow at '{workflowFile}'"

/-- Initialize a new Lake package in the given directory with the given name. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Init/Variantb09e1c6443ad79850975430ec9431d38558c5c68f31295197b7f52fe45dfb279.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Init/Variantb09e1c6443ad79850975430ec9431d38558c5c68f31295197b7f52fe45dfb279.lean#L376).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a0c9c29459d09418de77ce91909a26d44f9531a4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
