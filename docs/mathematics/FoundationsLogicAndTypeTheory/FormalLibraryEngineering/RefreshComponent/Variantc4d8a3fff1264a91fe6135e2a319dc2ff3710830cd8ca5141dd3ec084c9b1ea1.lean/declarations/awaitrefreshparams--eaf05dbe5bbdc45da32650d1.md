## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e6028b217c20d141f4099e36dacd43cbcf29cd191529b74f42a71bfaa5c3395c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 83–93.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure AwaitRefreshParams where
  state : WithRpcRef RefreshRef
  /-- The index of the HTML tree that is currently on display. -/
  oldIdx : Nat
  deriving RpcEncodable

/-- If any updates are available (i.e., the server-side state is more recent than the client's),
immediately return the most recent version of the HTML tree.
Otherwise await the next update.
Returns `none` if the client's state is the last one that should be shown. -/
@[server_rpc_method]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RefreshComponent/Variantc4d8a3fff1264a91fe6135e2a319dc2ff3710830cd8ca5141dd3ec084c9b1ea1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RefreshComponent/Variantc4d8a3fff1264a91fe6135e2a319dc2ff3710830cd8ca5141dd3ec084c9b1ea1.lean#L83).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8f91c21877717379da5d6aaec126cc51bcb97da4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
