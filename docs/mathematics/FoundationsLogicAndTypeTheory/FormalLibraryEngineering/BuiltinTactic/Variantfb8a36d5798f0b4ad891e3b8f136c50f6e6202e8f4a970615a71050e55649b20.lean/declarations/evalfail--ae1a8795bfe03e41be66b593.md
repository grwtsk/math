## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:877d93efd7075f81a4c3c4136b001002e0b63fcdf4bf900e1aba0d9dceb7a424`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 641–648.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[builtin_tactic «fail»] def evalFail : Tactic := fun stx => do
  let goals ← getGoals
  let goalsMsg := MessageData.joinSep (goals.map MessageData.ofGoal) m!"\n\n"
  match stx with
  | `(tactic| fail)          => throwError "Failed: `fail` tactic was invoked\n{goalsMsg}"
  | `(tactic| fail $msg:str) => throwError "{msg.getString}\n{goalsMsg}"
  | _ => throwUnsupportedSyntax

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/BuiltinTactic/Variantfb8a36d5798f0b4ad891e3b8f136c50f6e6202e8f4a970615a71050e55649b20.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/BuiltinTactic/Variantfb8a36d5798f0b4ad891e3b8f136c50f6e6202e8f4a970615a71050e55649b20.lean#L641).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `33b1ad92faeeedea2580823a3a9656fcec893769` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
