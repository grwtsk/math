## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:035e13bb83223d69c3390238d0afffaf3126c5b315e1a6c757a616756d2c6c49`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 512–525.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[builtin_tactic Lean.Parser.Tactic.substEqs] def evalSubstEqs : Tactic := fun _ =>
  Elab.Tactic.liftMetaTactic1 (·.substEqs)

/--
  Searches for a metavariable `g` s.t. `tag` is its exact name.
  If none then searches for a metavariable `g` s.t. `tag` is a suffix of its name.
  If none, then it searches for a metavariable `g` s.t. `tag` is a prefix of its name.

  We erase macro scopes from the metavariable's user name before comparing, so that
  user-written tags match even when a previous tactic left hygienic macro scopes at
  the end of the tag (e.g. `e_a.yield._@._internal._hyg.0`, where `yield` is not the
  literal last component of the name). Case tags written by the user are never
  macro-scoped, so erasing scopes on the mvar side is sufficient.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/BuiltinTactic/Variant3f10287e43de9d2f2a240545b4cd2c1d947c6c242f31d61aa9a3b11b26e7b06a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/BuiltinTactic/Variant3f10287e43de9d2f2a240545b4cd2c1d947c6c242f31d61aa9a3b11b26e7b06a.lean#L512).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9ac72035c41bb6175b7b6f262220e570d44586cd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
