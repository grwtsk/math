## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:375966147853d3d21fb9bb6f4a5de602b32f81ba28baa1f5be78d320ef4d2fab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1417–1422.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkEMatchTheoremForDecl (declName : Name) (thmKind : EMatchTheoremKind) (prios : SymbolPriorities)
    (showInfo := false) (minIndexable := false) : MetaM EMatchTheorem := do
  let some thm ← mkEMatchTheoremWithKind? (.decl declName) #[] (← getProofFor declName) thmKind prios (showInfo := showInfo) (minIndexable := minIndexable)
    | throwError "`@{thmKind.toAttribute minIndexable} theorem {.ofConstName declName}` {thmKind.explainFailure}, consider using different options or the `grind_pattern` command"
  return thm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/EMatchTheorem/Variant7862e0cc7cb98de3bcf3970865c0d8ef0926cd7112c0ec42a4d5d16d8502db50.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/EMatchTheorem/Variant7862e0cc7cb98de3bcf3970865c0d8ef0926cd7112c0ec42a4d5d16d8502db50.lean#L1417).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9d947cf9bc70039e5adf3ad5b7759178dd0d52bf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
