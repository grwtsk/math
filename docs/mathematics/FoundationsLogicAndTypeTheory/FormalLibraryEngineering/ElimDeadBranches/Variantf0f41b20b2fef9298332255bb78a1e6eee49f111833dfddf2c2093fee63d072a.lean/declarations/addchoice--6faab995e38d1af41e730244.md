## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a5b1a05ca3c81041fc5a3473ea16c074248a155e0d57e356fb1ecb130f79c981`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 92–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def addChoice (env : Environment) (vs : List Value) (v : Value) : List Value :=
  match vs, v with
  | [], v => [v]
  | v1@(ctor i1 vs1) :: cs, ctor i2 vs2 =>
    if i1 == i2 then
      ctor i1 (Array.zipWith (merge env) vs1 vs2) :: cs
    else
      v1 :: addChoice env cs v
  | _, _ => panic! s!"invalid addChoice {repr v} into {repr vs}"

/--
Merge two values into one. `bot` is the neutral element, `top` the annihilator.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ElimDeadBranches/Variantf0f41b20b2fef9298332255bb78a1e6eee49f111833dfddf2c2093fee63d072a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ElimDeadBranches/Variantf0f41b20b2fef9298332255bb78a1e6eee49f111833dfddf2c2093fee63d072a.lean#L92).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8b62986b401b14d81366e3bbe3e2275487d609cf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
