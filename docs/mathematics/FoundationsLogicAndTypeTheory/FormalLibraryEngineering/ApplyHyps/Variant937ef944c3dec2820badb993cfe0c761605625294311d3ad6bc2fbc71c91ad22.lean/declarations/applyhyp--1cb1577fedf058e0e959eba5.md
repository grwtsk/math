## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dffc3e5110d344f5bafa152c3cb770aaaaca6eeacb6b430e6cc06a44602bd49a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 25–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
meta def applyHyp (hyp : FVarId) (goal : MVarId) (md : TransparencyMode) :
    BaseM RuleApplication := do
  let (goals, #[step]) ← applyS goal (.fvar hyp) none md |>.run
    | throwError "aesop: internal error in applyHyps: multiple steps"
  let mkDiff newGoal := return {
    oldGoal := goal
    addedFVars := ∅
    removedFVars := ∅
    targetChanged := ! (← isGoalDiffDefeqTarget goal newGoal)
    newGoal
  }
  return {
    goals := ← goals.mapM fun newGoal => return { diff := ← mkDiff newGoal }
    postState := step.postState
    scriptSteps? := #[step]
    successProbability? := none
  }

@[aesop unsafe 75% tactic (rule_sets := [builtin])]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ApplyHyps/Variant937ef944c3dec2820badb993cfe0c761605625294311d3ad6bc2fbc71c91ad22.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ApplyHyps/Variant937ef944c3dec2820badb993cfe0c761605625294311d3ad6bc2fbc71c91ad22.lean#L25).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5c56e72859ef92c0ba09c5242d3a92422a9f0189` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
