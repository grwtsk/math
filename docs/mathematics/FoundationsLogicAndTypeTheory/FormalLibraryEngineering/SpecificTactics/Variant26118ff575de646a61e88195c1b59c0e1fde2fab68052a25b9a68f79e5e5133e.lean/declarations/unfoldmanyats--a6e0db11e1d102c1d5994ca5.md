## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c03282299bde8ab0cfcf02641f9cc8ce02c02332fc94554096e7f3fa8d869d0e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 318–333.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def unfoldManyAtS (unfold? : Name → Option (Option Name)) (goal : MVarId)
    (fvarId : FVarId) : ScriptM (Option (MVarId × Array Name)) := do
  let preState ← show MetaM _ from saveState
  let some (postGoal, usedDecls) ← unfoldManyAt unfold? goal fvarId
    | return none
  let postState ← show MetaM _ from saveState
  recordScriptStep {
    preGoal := goal
    tacticBuilders :=
      #[TacticBuilder.unfoldAt goal fvarId usedDecls (aesopUnfold := false),
        TacticBuilder.unfoldAt goal fvarId usedDecls (aesopUnfold := true)]
    postGoals := #[postGoal]
    preState, postState
  }
  return some (postGoal, usedDecls)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SpecificTactics/Variant26118ff575de646a61e88195c1b59c0e1fde2fab68052a25b9a68f79e5e5133e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SpecificTactics/Variant26118ff575de646a61e88195c1b59c0e1fde2fab68052a25b9a68f79e5e5133e.lean#L318).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0ca53b0f315c2a00b100c90a0cac0c7a65d935d3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
