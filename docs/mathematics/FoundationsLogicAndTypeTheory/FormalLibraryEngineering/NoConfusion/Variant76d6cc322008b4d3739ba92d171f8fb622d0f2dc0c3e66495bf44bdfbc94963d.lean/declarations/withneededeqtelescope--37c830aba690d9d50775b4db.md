## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:79247fe2cc7ee72bd073de791c002b04ca1b0ca84aa00c6724f53b76e6c2a16c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 167–189.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def withNeededEqTelescope [Inhabited α] (xs ys : Array Expr) (k : Array Expr → Array Expr → MetaM α) : MetaM α := do
  go xs.toList ys.toList #[] #[]
where
  go | x::xs', y::ys', vs, eqs => do
      if !xs'.isEmpty && (← isDefEq x y) then
        let eq ← mkEqRefl x
        go xs' ys' vs (eqs.push eq)
      else
        let eq ← mkEqHEq x y
        let name := if xs.size > 1 then (`eq).appendIndexAfter (eqs.size + 1) else `eq
        withLocalDeclD name eq fun v =>
          go xs' ys' (vs.push v) (eqs.push v)
      | _, _, vs, eqs => k vs eqs

/--
Telescoping `mkEqNDRec`: given
* motive `∀ y1 .. yn, P y1 .. yn`
* expression of type `P x1 .. xn`
* produces an expression of type (x1 = y1) → .. → (xn = yn) → P y1 .. yn
  (possibly using `HEq`)
produce an expression of type `motive y1 … yn`
by repeatedly applying `Eq.ndRec` (and `eq_of_heq` if needed).

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/NoConfusion/Variant76d6cc322008b4d3739ba92d171f8fb622d0f2dc0c3e66495bf44bdfbc94963d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/NoConfusion/Variant76d6cc322008b4d3739ba92d171f8fb622d0f2dc0c3e66495bf44bdfbc94963d.lean#L167).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3734c340f2c1712fdd0949b08c73acdc8245b613` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
