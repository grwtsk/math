## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ec96512e-0bbc-5322-c83a-f8552c9831f5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 57–65.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem centered_sum_mul_by_parts (a e : ℕ → ℝ) (δ : ℝ) (G : ℕ) :
    (∑ g ∈ Icc 1 G, a g * e g) - δ * (∑ g ∈ Icc 1 G, e g) =
      ((∑ g ∈ Icc 1 G, a g) - δ * (G : ℝ)) * e G +
        ∑ j ∈ Icc 1 (G - 1),
          ((∑ g ∈ Icc 1 j, a g) - δ * (j : ℝ)) * (e j - e (j + 1)) := by
  have h := sum_Icc_mul_by_parts (fun g ↦ a g - δ) e G
  simp_rw [centered_sum] at h
  simpa only [sub_mul, sum_sub_distrib, ← mul_sum] using h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FiniteAbelVariation/Variant1d0c137a6b8de8e124557dbb96ecf014f668fd85044a44d909ea26c3da2ca965.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FiniteAbelVariation/Variant1d0c137a6b8de8e124557dbb96ecf014f668fd85044a44d909ea26c3da2ca965.lean#L57).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b156b3f190277b2a82cd27a7cdd10cddb11547a0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
