## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a64870c0985f683bb40a4badde6c65709a2ab74a55519ab0723c77f3a4e01fe0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 64–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private partial def getUnusedForallInstanceBinderIdxsWhere (p : Expr → Bool) (e : Expr) : Array Nat :=
  go e 0 #[]
where
  /-- Inspects `body`, and if it is a `.forallE` of an instance with type `type` such that `p type`
  is `true` and the remainder of the type does not depend on it, pushes the `current` index onto
  the accumulated array. -/
  go (body : Expr) (current : Nat) (acc : Array Nat) : Array Nat :=
    match body.cleanupAnnotations with
    | .forallE _ type body bi => go body (current+1) <|
      if bi.isInstImplicit && p type && !(body.hasLooseBVar 0) then
        acc.push current
      else
        acc
    /- See through `letE`, and just as in the interpretation of a bound provided to
    `forallBoundedTelescope`, do not increment the number of binders we've counted. -/
    | .letE _ _ _ body _ => go body current acc
    | _ => acc

end Expr

namespace Environment

/--
Like `findConstVal?`, but only finds the `ConstantVal` for `decl` in `env` if its kind satisfies
`p`. Otherwise, returns `none`.

Blocks on everything but the constant's body (if any), which is not accessible through the result.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/UnusedDecidableInType/Variante92bccf9afe813396d426aaac7102e4d9fe397eee8c0474f12cc517ea9ef051a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/UnusedDecidableInType/Variante92bccf9afe813396d426aaac7102e4d9fe397eee8c0474f12cc517ea9ef051a.lean#L64).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a241d4d25dde59108f682f0bcadbfd1f3049c513` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
