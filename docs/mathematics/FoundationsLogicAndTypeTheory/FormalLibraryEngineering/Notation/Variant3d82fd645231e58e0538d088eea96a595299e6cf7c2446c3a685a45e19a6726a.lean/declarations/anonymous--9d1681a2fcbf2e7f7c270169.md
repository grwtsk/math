## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cb98d80dedb22d778a01ed07b9202e17b002ee3e023719c0ad43ad2c89594494`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 553–563.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
        def $(Lean.mkIdent delabName) : Delab := whenPPOption getPPNotation <|
          getExpr >>= fun e => $matcher MatchState.empty >>= fun s => $result)
      trace[notation3] "Defined delaborator {currNamespace ++ delabName}"
      let delabKeys := ms.foldr (·.1 ++ ·) []
      trace[notation3] "Adding `delab` attribute for keys {delabKeys}"
      for key in delabKeys do
        elabCommand <| ← `(command| attribute [delab $(mkIdent key)] $(Lean.mkIdent delabName))
    else
      logWarning s!"Could not generate matchers for a delaborator, so notation will not be pretty{
        ""} printed. Consider either adjusting the expansions or use{
        ""} `notation3 (prettyPrint := false)`."
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Notation/Variant3d82fd645231e58e0538d088eea96a595299e6cf7c2446c3a685a45e19a6726a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Notation/Variant3d82fd645231e58e0538d088eea96a595299e6cf7c2446c3a685a45e19a6726a.lean#L553).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `72e9eb1e0540644c31b831b52b9a8558bb2fcfd8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
