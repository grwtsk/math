## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d8afcf26883bdf5d7b782621bf8a2682cff8a66b412b72fb53a7cc35afc9c26f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 217–232.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def fnArgMatcher (arity : Nat) (matchf : Matcher) (matchers : Array (Nat × Matcher)) :
    Matcher := fun s => do
  let mut s := s
  let nargs := (← getExpr).getAppNumArgs
  guard <| nargs == arity
  s ← withNaryFn <| matchf s
  for (i, matcher) in matchers do
    s ← withNaryArg i <| matcher s
  return s

/-- Returns a `Term` that represents a `Matcher` for the given pattern `stx`.
The `boundNames` set determines which identifiers are variables in the pattern.
Fails in the `OptionT` sense if it comes across something it's unable to handle.

Also returns constant names that could serve as a key for a delaborator.
For example, if it's for a function `f`, then `app.f`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Notation/Variant3d82fd645231e58e0538d088eea96a595299e6cf7c2446c3a685a45e19a6726a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Notation/Variant3d82fd645231e58e0538d088eea96a595299e6cf7c2446c3a685a45e19a6726a.lean#L217).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `72e9eb1e0540644c31b831b52b9a8558bb2fcfd8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
