## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fec371c9-72a3-6836-4c36-d1df64584f6a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 101–107.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] public theorem toList_roc {α : Type u} {β : α → Type v}
    (cmp : α → α → Ordering := by exact compare) [TransCmp cmp]
    {t : DTreeMap α β cmp} {lowerBound upperBound : α} :
    t[lowerBound<...=upperBound].toList =
      t.toList.filter (fun e => (cmp e.fst lowerBound).isGT ∧ (cmp e.fst upperBound).isLE) :=
  @Internal.toList_roc α β ⟨cmp⟩ _ t.inner (@t.wf.ordered α β ⟨cmp⟩ _) lowerBound upperBound

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Slice/Variant6d918227e68e3531fc21a2fd8ec36893ca8d907ddec96a67096a66fab435e9bf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Slice/Variant6d918227e68e3531fc21a2fd8ec36893ca8d907ddec96a67096a66fab435e9bf.lean#L101).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `345a0cf968493ab96531f494c7e4f5ef2c39746c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
