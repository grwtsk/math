## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:37cc41ee-6540-5487-c281-7bca6db6122a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 137–149.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem reaches_eval {σ} {f : σ → Option σ} {a b} (ab : Reaches f a b) : eval f a = eval f b := by
  refine Part.ext fun _ ↦ ⟨fun h ↦ ?_, fun h ↦ ?_⟩
  · have ⟨ac, c0⟩ := mem_eval.1 h
    exact mem_eval.2 ⟨(or_iff_left_of_imp fun cb ↦ (eval_maximal h).1 cb ▸ ReflTransGen.refl).1
      (reaches_total ab ac), c0⟩
  · have ⟨bc, c0⟩ := mem_eval.1 h
    exact mem_eval.2 ⟨ab.trans bc, c0⟩

/-- Given a relation `tr : σ₁ → σ₂ → Prop` between state spaces, and state transition functions
`f₁ : σ₁ → Option σ₁` and `f₂ : σ₂ → Option σ₂`, `Respects f₁ f₂ tr` means that if `tr a₁ a₂` holds
initially and `f₁` takes a step to `a₂` then `f₂` will take one or more steps before reaching a
state `b₂` satisfying `tr a₂ b₂`, and if `f₁ a₁` terminates then `f₂ a₂` also terminates.
Such a relation `tr` is also known as a refinement. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/StateTransition/Variant8722e395586a1b64360a1ee14e49f44e5753eaea2189409bf5caaab9f5e49b0f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/StateTransition/Variant8722e395586a1b64360a1ee14e49f44e5753eaea2189409bf5caaab9f5e49b0f.lean#L137).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7311b856046b221f269d0e4c240290824b1277c1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
