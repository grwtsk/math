## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2db50e0e-a99e-21dc-4f05-2545b6629601`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–62.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem reaches₁_fwd {σ} {f : σ → Option σ} {a b c} (h₁ : Reaches₁ f a c) (h₂ : b ∈ f a) :
    Reaches f b c := by
  rcases TransGen.head'_iff.1 h₁ with ⟨b', hab, hbc⟩
  cases Option.mem_unique hab h₂; exact hbc

/-- A variation on `Reaches`. `Reaches₀ f a b` holds if whenever `Reaches₁ f b c` then
`Reaches₁ f a c`. This is a weaker property than `Reaches` and is useful for replacing states with
equivalent states without taking a step. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/StateTransition/Variant8722e395586a1b64360a1ee14e49f44e5753eaea2189409bf5caaab9f5e49b0f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/StateTransition/Variant8722e395586a1b64360a1ee14e49f44e5753eaea2189409bf5caaab9f5e49b0f.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7311b856046b221f269d0e4c240290824b1277c1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
