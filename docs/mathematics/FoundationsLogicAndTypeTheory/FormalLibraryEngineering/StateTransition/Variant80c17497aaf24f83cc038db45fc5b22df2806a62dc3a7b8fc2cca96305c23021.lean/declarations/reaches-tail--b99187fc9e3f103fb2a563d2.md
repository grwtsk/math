## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aad98b3c-853e-41d2-3137-b0f2d8a8f5c6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 102–110.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Reaches₀.tail' {σ} {f : σ → Option σ} {a b c : σ} (h : Reaches₀ f a b) (h₂ : c ∈ f b) :
    Reaches₁ f a c :=
  h _ (TransGen.single h₂)

/-- (co-)Induction principle for `eval`. If a property `C` holds of any point `a` evaluating to `b`
which is either terminal (meaning `a = b`) or where the next point also satisfies `C`, then it
holds of any point where `eval f a` evaluates to `b`. This formalizes the notion that if
`eval f a` evaluates to `b` then it reaches terminal state `b` in finitely many steps. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/StateTransition/Variant80c17497aaf24f83cc038db45fc5b22df2806a62dc3a7b8fc2cca96305c23021.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/StateTransition/Variant80c17497aaf24f83cc038db45fc5b22df2806a62dc3a7b8fc2cca96305c23021.lean#L102).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bdec1b827e32b23b3973527c3038855fcb07c371` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
