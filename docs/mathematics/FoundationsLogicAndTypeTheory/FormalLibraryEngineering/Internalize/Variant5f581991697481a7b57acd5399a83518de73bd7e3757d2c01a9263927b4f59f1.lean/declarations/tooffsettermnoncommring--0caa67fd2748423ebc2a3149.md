## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d4a63fd3b592816942da50339ae95aa1a2e46c275371e2648f178d6ec6ad2644`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 265–273.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toOffsetTermNonCommRing? (e : Expr) : NonCommRingM (Option OffsetTermResult) := do
  let some e ← ncreify? e (skipVar := false) | return none
  let p := e.toPoly_nc
  let k := p.getConst
  let p := p.addConst (-k)
  let a ← shareCommon (← p.denoteExpr)
  let h ← mkNonCommTermEqProof e (.add (p.toExpr) (.intCast k))
  return some { a, k, h }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Internalize/Variant5f581991697481a7b57acd5399a83518de73bd7e3757d2c01a9263927b4f59f1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Internalize/Variant5f581991697481a7b57acd5399a83518de73bd7e3757d2c01a9263927b4f59f1.lean#L265).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d42e9efc7d24cb5af822793562774c9740f80183` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
