## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6a5c7115497948c840737ce6704cf879c5b78675c20008d7c84241f3cace9524`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 377–395.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
private def extParentsToIgnore (declName : Name) : Bool :=
  declName == ``Eq || declName == ``HEq || declName == ``dite || declName == ``ite
  || declName == ``Exists || declName == ``Subtype

/--
Given a term `arg` that occurs as the argument at position `i` of an `f`-application `parent?`,
we consider `arg` as a candidate for case-splitting. For every other argument `arg'` that also appears
at position `i` in an `f`-application and has the same type as `e`, we add the case-split candidate `arg = arg'`.

When performing the case split, we consider the following two cases:
- `arg = arg'`, which may introduce a new congruence between the corresponding `f`-applications.
- `¬(arg = arg')`, which may trigger extensionality theorems for the type of `arg`.

This feature enables `grind` to solve examples such as:
```lean
example (f : (Nat → Nat) → Nat) : a = b → f (fun x => a + x) = f (fun x => b + x) := by
  grind
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Internalize/Variant691362554417cf1861ebfa2a82838268673cf8054cd6e63e74d8567f5bea0787.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Internalize/Variant691362554417cf1861ebfa2a82838268673cf8054cd6e63e74d8567f5bea0787.lean#L377).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `33164ab9d00bfdda88417ea42e8846b49b9d596d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
