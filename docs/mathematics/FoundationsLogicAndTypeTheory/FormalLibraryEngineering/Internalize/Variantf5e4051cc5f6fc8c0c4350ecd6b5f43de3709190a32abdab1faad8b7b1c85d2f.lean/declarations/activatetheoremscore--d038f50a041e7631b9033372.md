## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:21d41989aed75f1e3558c90f7d8e539fcfe14dd796ccfbc07d946f0c73b78528`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 276–298.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def activateTheoremsCore [TheoremLike α] (declName : Name)
    (getThms : GoalM (TheoremsArray α))
    (setThms : TheoremsArray α → GoalM Unit)
    (reinsertThm : α → GoalM Unit)
    (activateThm : α → GoalM Unit) : GoalM Unit := do
  if let some (thms, s) := (← getThms).retrieve? declName then
    setThms s
    for thm in thms do
      let origin := TheoremLike.getOrigin thm
      trace_goal[grind.debug.theorem.activate] "`{declName}` => `{origin.key}`"
      unless s.isErased origin do
        let indicesFound := (← get).indicesFound
        let symbols      := TheoremLike.getSymbols thm
        let symbols      := symbols.filter fun sym => !indicesFound.contains sym
        let thm          := TheoremLike.setSymbols thm symbols
        match symbols with
        | [] =>
          trace_goal[grind.debug.theorem.activate] "`{origin.key}`"
          activateThm thm
        | _ =>
          trace_goal[grind.debug.theorem.activate] "reinsert `{origin.key}`"
          reinsertThm thm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Internalize/Variantf5e4051cc5f6fc8c0c4350ecd6b5f43de3709190a32abdab1faad8b7b1c85d2f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Internalize/Variantf5e4051cc5f6fc8c0c4350ecd6b5f43de3709190a32abdab1faad8b7b1c85d2f.lean#L276).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `30785a5302abff1277a64edfeba73f2859bb7cb5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
