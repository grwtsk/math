## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c82f366cbbc999600d02db8ccbc5240f709d1da372451e5ee44caa7ed6ae78b9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 134–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Whitespace where
  /-- The leading whitespace after regrouping whitespace so that `trailing` does not
  include newlines. Includes exactly one newline of ASCII whitespace at the end of `leading` if
  there are non-whitespace characters in it (which is suitable for normalized `import` comments),
  and no ASCII whitespace at the beginning. If there are no non-ASCII-whitespace characters in
  `leading`, it is empty. -/
  -- TODO: consider storing the newline behavior in a `Bool`, since the insistence on a
  -- final newline is overly specific to `import`s.
  leading : String
  /-- The trailing whitespace after regrouping whitespace so that the `trailing` whitespace has no
  newlines. May have ASCII whitespace on the left. -/
  trailing : String
deriving Repr, Inhabited, Hashable, BEq, ToJson, FromJson

namespace Whitespace

-- TODO: could avoid `length` if we stuck with `Substring.Raw`
/--
Sorts whitespace first by `leading` length, then `trailing` length, then alphabetical in each.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Pretty/Variant0ceb1cafe351649c1f63bf733b2c26f0711c5e8fb2cec4f0b3940930def69655.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Pretty/Variant0ceb1cafe351649c1f63bf733b2c26f0711c5e8fb2cec4f0b3940930def69655.lean#L134).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `140f205e95cdd514d5146d8eb762221c32590ecb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
