## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `elab` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bb3d40e2c8552c0d58c20d72c37e3339c4fd1e74957229ad95dbc13b4046527f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 442–459.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
elab "#check_supported_inv " t:term : command => do
  let (ast, proof, proofType) ← liftTermElabM do
    let t ← elabTerm t none
    let t ← instantiateMVars t
    let ast ← reify t
    let proof ← mkSupportedWithInvProof ast
    let proofType ← inferType proof
    return (ast, proof, proofType)
  logInfo m!"AST: {ast}"
  logInfo m!"Generated proof: {proof}"
  logInfo m!"Proof type: {proofType}"

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ProveSupported/Variant26a2207a3334740d17a58d0f1b3130d00af406a3d33b4d751eb56e52d451e608.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ProveSupported/Variant26a2207a3334740d17a58d0f1b3130d00af406a3d33b4d751eb56e52d451e608.lean#L442).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8ebd584a937578ce6fb6d8f5e1a98637b8e79804` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
