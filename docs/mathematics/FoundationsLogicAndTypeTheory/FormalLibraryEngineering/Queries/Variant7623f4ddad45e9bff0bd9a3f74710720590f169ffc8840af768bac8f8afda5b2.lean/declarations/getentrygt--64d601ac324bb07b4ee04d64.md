## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a619e1ac2f84afc2911cd7a5d22a4581fdeeb20639e4b8d06c74d48d4c799c82`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 619–632.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getEntryGT [Ord α] [TransOrd α] (k : α) :
    (t : Impl α β) → (ho : t.Ordered) → (he : ∃ a ∈ t, compare a k = .gt) → (a : α) × β a
  | .leaf, _, he => False.elim <| by obtain ⟨_, ha, _⟩ := he; cases ha
  | .inner _ ky y l r, ho, he => if hkky : compare k ky = .lt then
        getEntryGTD k l ⟨ky, y⟩
      else
        getEntryGT k r ho.right <| by
          obtain ⟨a, hm, hc⟩ := he
          refine ⟨a, ?_, hc⟩
          apply Ordered.mem_inner_iff_mem_right .. |>.mp hm
          apply TransCmp.gt_of_gt_of_isGE hc
          simpa [← Ordering.isGE_eq_false, Bool.not_eq_false] using hkky

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Queries/Variant7623f4ddad45e9bff0bd9a3f74710720590f169ffc8840af768bac8f8afda5b2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Queries/Variant7623f4ddad45e9bff0bd9a3f74710720590f169ffc8840af768bac8f8afda5b2.lean#L619).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c4bf7a41b47d0f24218a9c6f8f40300021f51dbb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
