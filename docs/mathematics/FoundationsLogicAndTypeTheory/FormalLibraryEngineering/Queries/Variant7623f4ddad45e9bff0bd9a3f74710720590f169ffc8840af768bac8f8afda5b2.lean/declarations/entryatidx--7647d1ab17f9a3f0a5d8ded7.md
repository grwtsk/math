## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ca6b05ef85ffd7fce50d12787091474967ec7ed9834ba2a06abfbf7f29896c6e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 466–474.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def entryAtIdx! [Inhabited ((a : α) × β a)] : Impl α β → Nat → (a : α) × β a
  | .leaf, _ => panic! "Out-of-bounds access"
  | .inner _ k v l r, n =>
    match compare n l.size with
    | .lt => l.entryAtIdx! n
    | .eq => ⟨k, v⟩
    | .gt => r.entryAtIdx! (n - l.size - 1)

/-- Implementation detail of the tree map -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Queries/Variant7623f4ddad45e9bff0bd9a3f74710720590f169ffc8840af768bac8f8afda5b2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Queries/Variant7623f4ddad45e9bff0bd9a3f74710720590f169ffc8840af768bac8f8afda5b2.lean#L466).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c4bf7a41b47d0f24218a9c6f8f40300021f51dbb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
