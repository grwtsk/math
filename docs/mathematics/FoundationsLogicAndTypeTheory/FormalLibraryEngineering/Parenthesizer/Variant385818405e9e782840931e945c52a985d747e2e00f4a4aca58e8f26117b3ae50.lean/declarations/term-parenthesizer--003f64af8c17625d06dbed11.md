## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:89a1dee13dffae5a59c549d195f8174f5d4b36581df1bc32b3bf9741fdb8aac5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 389–405.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def term.parenthesizer : CategoryParenthesizer | prec => do
  maybeParenthesize `term true wrapParens prec $
    parenthesizeCategoryCore `term prec
where
  /-- Wraps the term `stx` in parentheses and then moves its `SourceInfo` to the result.
  The purpose of this is to move synthetic delaborator positions from the `stx` node to the parentheses node,
  which causes the info view to view the node with parentheses as referring to the parenthesized expression.
  If we did not move info, the info view would consider the parentheses to belong to the outer term.
  Note: we do not do `withRef stx` because that causes the "(" and ")" tokens to have source info as well,
  causing the info view to highlight each parenthesis as an independent expression. -/
  wrapParens (stx : Syntax) : Syntax := Unhygienic.run do
    let stxInfo := SourceInfo.fromRef stx
    let stx := stx.setInfo .none
    let pstx ← `(($(⟨stx⟩)))
    return pstx.raw.setInfo stxInfo

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Parenthesizer/Variant385818405e9e782840931e945c52a985d747e2e00f4a4aca58e8f26117b3ae50.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Parenthesizer/Variant385818405e9e782840931e945c52a985d747e2e00f4a4aca58e8f26117b3ae50.lean#L389).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `67adf57b2873a885e7d24eeabe4e67d7843c03de` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
