## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `syntax` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cd115116427b12efc327e24a889aeaec52bdde0755f897f1014366a54e480e4d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 37–44.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
syntax (name := failIfNoProgress) "fail_if_no_progress " tacticSeq : tactic

/-- `lctxIsDefEq l₁ l₂` compares two lists of `Option LocalDecl`s (as returned from e.g.
`(← (← getMainGoal).getDecl).lctx.decls.toList`). It returns `true` if they have the same
local declarations in the same order (up to defeq, without setting mvars), and `false` otherwise.

Assumption: this function is run with one of the local contexts as the current `MetaM` local
context, and one of the two lists consists of the `LocalDecl`s of that context. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FailIfNoProgress/Variant39b19a8a639d7607721efb62766bff77376e0f4319ef1de6fed3f2738ac51e75.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FailIfNoProgress/Variant39b19a8a639d7607721efb62766bff77376e0f4319ef1de6fed3f2738ac51e75.lean#L37).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `00a6545c4d97cb8eb0be6cd20b57b7b8cd8dbe44` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
