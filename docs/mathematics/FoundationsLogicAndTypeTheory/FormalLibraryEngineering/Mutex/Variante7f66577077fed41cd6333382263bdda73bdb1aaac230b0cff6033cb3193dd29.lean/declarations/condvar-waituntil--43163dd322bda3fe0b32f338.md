## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f8cfad8e28a479b1106b683c1e6343b01d793c4e10b79573217eed4fb595912b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Condvar.waitUntil [Monad m] [MonadLiftT BaseIO m]
    (condvar : Condvar) (mutex : BaseMutex) (pred : m Bool) : m Unit := do
  while !(← pred) do
    condvar.wait mutex

/--
Mutual exclusion primitive (lock) guarding shared state of type `α`.

The type `Mutex α` is similar to `IO.Ref α`, except that concurrent accesses are guarded by a mutex
instead of atomic pointer operations and busy-waiting.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Mutex/Variante7f66577077fed41cd6333382263bdda73bdb1aaac230b0cff6033cb3193dd29.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Mutex/Variante7f66577077fed41cd6333382263bdda73bdb1aaac230b0cff6033cb3193dd29.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `668308c898823a2afcf1522fd4d32209f6c948fe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
