## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6f5870bd8c30531950b8da42bc01dcfde4f70e59ce728a2ebf7f721f0ad4853a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 216–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def helpTest :=
"Test the workspace's root package using its configured test driver

USAGE:
  lake test [-- <args>...]

A test driver can be configured by either setting the 'testDriver'
package configuration option or by tagging a script, executable, or library
`@[test_driver]`. A definition in a dependency can be used as a test driver
by using the `<pkg>/<name>` syntax for the 'testDriver' configuration option.

A script test driver will be run with the  package configuration's
`testDriverArgs` plus the CLI `args`. An executable test driver will be
built and then run like a script. A library test driver will just be built.
"

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Help/Variant7f515afd6447ce1f36e01c4908d22f4f9036ddbf5124ba07aa0858b06f34dd11.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Help/Variant7f515afd6447ce1f36e01c4908d22f4f9036ddbf5124ba07aa0858b06f34dd11.lean#L216).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0771b93d8ef6684289739644590faee450775272` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
