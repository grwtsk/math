## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:41006e8ee34afe304f147f3947a51cfb6760aa010ac01b96cb79c74c727965b1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 204–223.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def helpUpdate :=
"Update dependencies and save them to the manifest

USAGE:
  lake update [<package>...]

ALIAS: lake upgrade

Updates the Lake package manifest (i.e., `lake-manifest.json`),
downloading and upgrading packages as needed. For each new (transitive) git
dependency, the appropriate commit is cloned into a subdirectory of
`packagesDir`. No copy is made of local dependencies.

If a set of packages are specified, said dependencies are upgraded to
the latest version compatible with the package's configuration (or removed if
removed from the configuration). If there are dependencies on multiple versions
of the same package, the version materialized is undefined.

A bare `lake update` will upgrade all dependencies."

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Help/Variant225c8d90c490b4f22fb3d2770f29c43454a02e69143534cae0d47f2e2652de9e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Help/Variant225c8d90c490b4f22fb3d2770f29c43454a02e69143534cae0d47f2e2652de9e.lean#L204).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e50471c35411bf2c77e05eaed2a37ad36a5bcd91` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
