## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1a5bb0793f866257c9ed05f0618f30c19cfc3067609d0bb52d6666c2d37db682`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 373–383.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def tacticStatesEqualUpToIdsCore (goals₁ goals₂ : Array MVarId) :
    EqualUpToIdsM Bool := do
  if goals₁.size != goals₂.size then
    return false
  for g₁ in goals₁, g₂ in goals₂ do
    if ! (← unassignedMVarsEqualUpToIdsCore g₁ g₂) then
      return false
  return true

end EqualUpToIds

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/EqualUpToIds/Variant5cb2b601c59ef55202ff1d747edb6587cf37deda5e3f66b1d3b41f643f21e744.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/EqualUpToIds/Variant5cb2b601c59ef55202ff1d747edb6587cf37deda5e3f66b1d3b41f643f21e744.lean#L373).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a2c96db4a17e1ae56ef52af2e8f1d51cb8ab9ec` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
