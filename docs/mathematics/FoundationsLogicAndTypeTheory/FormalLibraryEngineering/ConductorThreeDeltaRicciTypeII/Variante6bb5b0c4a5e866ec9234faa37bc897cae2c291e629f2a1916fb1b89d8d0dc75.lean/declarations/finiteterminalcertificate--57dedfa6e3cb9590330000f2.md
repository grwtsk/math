## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a9a289e565942e0b2836f9edf16e50acd36aeb1974c9497e4be7a0e5f11a324d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–132.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure FiniteTerminalCertificate (state : State) where
  active_card_le_one : state.correlation.activeAtoms.card ≤ 1
  terminalCost : ℝ
  terminalCost_nonneg : 0 ≤ terminalCost
  directCoefficientBound : state.correlation.maxPotential ≤ terminalCost

/-- Explicit topological recognition and cut adapter for a surgical neck.

`SphericalLinkCandidate` alone is only an incidence/Euler candidate.  A
binary surgery node therefore also carries a separately proved topological
sphere-recognition proposition and a proposition identifying the algebraic
children with the recognized cut.  These are assumptions at this interface,
not consequences of the candidate fields. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ConductorThreeDeltaRicciTypeII/Variante6bb5b0c4a5e866ec9234faa37bc897cae2c291e629f2a1916fb1b89d8d0dc75.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ConductorThreeDeltaRicciTypeII/Variante6bb5b0c4a5e866ec9234faa37bc897cae2c291e629f2a1916fb1b89d8d0dc75.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ae6f9136955cd5add69a226b84bde01ac743263` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
