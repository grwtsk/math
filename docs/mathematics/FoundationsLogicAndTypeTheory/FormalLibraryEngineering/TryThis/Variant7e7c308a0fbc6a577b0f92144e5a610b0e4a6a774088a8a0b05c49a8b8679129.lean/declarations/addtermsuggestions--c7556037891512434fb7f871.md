## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:51e04342db18d13ef5e1bd796483d06e6c1fef5895f703eb9adfbd9a807e1598`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 461–464.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def addTermSuggestions (ref : Syntax) (es : Array Expr)
    (origSpan? : Option Syntax := none) (header : String := "Try these:") : MetaM Unit := do
  addSuggestions ref (← es.mapM delabToRefinableSuggestion)
    (origSpan? := origSpan?) (header := header)
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TryThis/Variant7e7c308a0fbc6a577b0f92144e5a610b0e4a6a774088a8a0b05c49a8b8679129.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TryThis/Variant7e7c308a0fbc6a577b0f92144e5a610b0e4a6a774088a8a0b05c49a8b8679129.lean#L461).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7f62933eeebe64c6ed0135dd28b13636a908c6f4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
