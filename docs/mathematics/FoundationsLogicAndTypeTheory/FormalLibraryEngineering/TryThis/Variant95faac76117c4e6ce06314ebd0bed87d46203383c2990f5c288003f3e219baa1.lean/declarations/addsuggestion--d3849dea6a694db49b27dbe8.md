## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ba63728655c3223397e81ba97c085b1cb0047512c7dccb8a5ff91920d32b6d3d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–141.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def addSuggestion (ref : Syntax) (s : Suggestion) (origSpan? : Option Syntax := none)
    (header : String := "Try this:") (codeActionPrefix? : Option String := none)
    (diffGranularity : Hint.DiffGranularity := .none)
    (footer : MessageData := MessageData.nil) : CoreM Unit := do
  let hintSuggestion := {
    span? := origSpan?
    diffGranularity
    toTryThisSuggestion := s
  }
  let suggs ← Hint.mkSuggestionsMessage #[hintSuggestion] ref codeActionPrefix? (forceList := false)
  logInfoAt ref m!"{header}{suggs}{footer}"

set_option linter.unusedVariables false in
/-- Add a list of "try this" suggestions as a single "try these" suggestion. This has two effects:

* A widget diagnostic is displayed, saying `Try these: <list of suggestions>` with a link on
  each suggestion in `<list of suggestions>` to apply each suggestion
* A code action for each suggestion is added, which will apply the suggestion.

The parameters are:
* `ref`: the span of the widget diagnostic
* `suggestions`: an array of `Suggestion`s, which each contain
  * `suggestion`: the replacement text
  * `preInfo?`: an optional string shown immediately before the replacement text in the widget
    message (only)
  * `postInfo?`: an optional string shown immediately after the replacement text in the widget
    message (only)
  * `messageData?`: an optional `MessageData` displayed instead of `suggestion`.
    If set, implies `diffGranularity = .none`.
  * `toCodeActionTitle?`: an optional function `String → String` describing how to transform the
    pretty-printed suggestion text into the code action text which appears in the lightbulb menu.
    If `none`, we simply prepend `"Try this: "` to the suggestion text.
* `origSpan?`: a syntax object whose span is the actual text to be replaced by `suggestion`.
  If not provided it defaults to `ref`.
* `header`: a string that precedes the list. By default, it is `"Try these:"`.
* `style?` (**deprecated**): unused.
* `codeActionPrefix?`: an optional string to be used as the prefix of the replacement text for all
  suggestions which do not have a custom `toCodeActionTitle?`. If not provided, `"Try this: "` is
  used.
* `diffGranularity`: How to compute the diff display in the suggestion. Defaults to only displaying
  the inserted string.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TryThis/Variant95faac76117c4e6ce06314ebd0bed87d46203383c2990f5c288003f3e219baa1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TryThis/Variant95faac76117c4e6ce06314ebd0bed87d46203383c2990f5c288003f3e219baa1.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `04ec345a1b666ab681b7a955732c2e1dc5106cea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
