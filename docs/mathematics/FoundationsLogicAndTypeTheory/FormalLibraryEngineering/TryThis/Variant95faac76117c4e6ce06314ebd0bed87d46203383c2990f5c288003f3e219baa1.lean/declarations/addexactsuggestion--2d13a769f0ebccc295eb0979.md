## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2f84845d0841f2adbdbe52af7e40463e15c8346ca6d8f8403e989247e0d2da2f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 261–293.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def addExactSuggestion (ref : Syntax) (e : Expr)
    (origSpan? : Option Syntax := none)
    (addSubgoalsMsg := false)
    (codeActionPrefix? : Option String := none)
    (checkState? : Option Tactic.SavedState := none)
    (tacticErrorAsInfo := false) : TacticM Unit := do
  match (← addExactSuggestionCore addSubgoalsMsg checkState? e) with
  | .inl suggestion =>
    addSuggestion ref suggestion
      (origSpan? := origSpan?) (codeActionPrefix? := codeActionPrefix?)
  | .inr message =>
    if tacticErrorAsInfo then logInfo message else throwError message

/-- Add `exact e` or `refine e` suggestions if they can be successfully generated; for those that
cannot, display messages indicating the invalid generated tactics.

The parameters are:
* `ref`: the span of the widget diagnostic
* `es`: the array of replacement expressions
* `origSpan?`: a syntax object whose span is the actual text to be replaced by `suggestion`.
  If not provided it defaults to `ref`.
* `addSubgoalsMsg`: if true (default false), any remaining subgoals will be shown after
  `Remaining subgoals:`
* `codeActionPrefix?`: an optional string to be used as the prefix of the replacement text for all
  suggestions which do not have a custom `toCodeActionTitle?`. If not provided, `"Try this: "` is
  used.
* `checkState?`: if passed, the tactic state in which the generated tactics will be validated,
  inserting `expose_names` if necessary.
* `tacticErrorAsInfo`: if true (default true), invalid generated tactics will log info messages
  instead of throwing an error. The default behavior differs from `addExactSuggestion` because
  throwing an error means that any subsequent suggestions will not be displayed. Has no effect if
  `checkState?` is `none`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TryThis/Variant95faac76117c4e6ce06314ebd0bed87d46203383c2990f5c288003f3e219baa1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TryThis/Variant95faac76117c4e6ce06314ebd0bed87d46203383c2990f5c288003f3e219baa1.lean#L261).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `04ec345a1b666ab681b7a955732c2e1dc5106cea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
