## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:38eae45b0db8b072315afa84dcd0cf5afef61e82c70c32bd1cf58b2a87024662`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 121–134.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def SuggestionStyle.value (t : Float) (showValueInHoverText := true) : SuggestionStyle :=
  let t := min (max t 0) 1
  json% {
    className: "pointer dim",
    -- interpolates linearly from 0º to 120º with 95% saturation and lightness
    -- varying around 50% in HSL space
    style: { color: $(s!"hsl({(t * 120).round} 95% {60 * ((t - 0.5)^2 + 0.75)}%)") },
    title: $(if showValueInHoverText then s!"Apply suggestion ({t})" else "Apply suggestion")
  }

/-- Holds a `suggestion` for replacement, along with `preInfo` and `postInfo` strings to be printed
immediately before and after that suggestion, respectively. It also includes an optional
`MessageData` to represent the suggestion in logs; by default, this is `none`, and `suggestion` is
used. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TryThis/Variant6f7a09d17eb4f637d2b52e1c24b1728bf689d8de2e53b7544c6fce91d78dda81.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TryThis/Variant6f7a09d17eb4f637d2b52e1c24b1728bf689d8de2e53b7544c6fce91d78dda81.lean#L121).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `35fee7894b51c2b3d6e1fb4865e9b3baa3d239e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
