## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2ae6a9c5182c63d074840b959c22983e4401ace25d783eff2e0f22d89b0593e6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 286–314.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def addExactSuggestions (ref : Syntax) (es : Array Expr)
    (origSpan? : Option Syntax := none) (addSubgoalsMsg := false)
    (codeActionPrefix? : Option String := none)
    (checkState? : Option Tactic.SavedState := none)
    (tacticErrorAsInfo := true) : TacticM Unit := do
  let suggestionOrMessages ← es.mapM <| addExactSuggestionCore addSubgoalsMsg checkState?
  let mut suggestions : Array Suggestion := #[]
  let mut messages : Array MessageData := #[]
  for suggestionOrMessage in suggestionOrMessages do
    match suggestionOrMessage with
    | .inl suggestion => suggestions := suggestions.push suggestion
    | .inr message =>
      unless tacticErrorAsInfo do throwError message
      messages := messages.push message
  addSuggestions ref suggestions (origSpan? := origSpan?) (codeActionPrefix? := codeActionPrefix?)
  for message in messages do
    logInfo message

/-- Add a term suggestion.

The parameters are:
* `ref`: the span of the widget diagnostic
* `e`: the replacement expression
* `origSpan?`: a syntax object whose span is the actual text to be replaced by `suggestion`.
  If not provided it defaults to `ref`.
* `header`: a string which precedes the suggestion. By default, it's `"Try this:"`.
* `codeActionPrefix?`: an optional string to be used as the prefix of the replacement text if the
  suggestion does not have a custom `toCodeActionTitle?`. If not provided, `"Try this: "` is used.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TryThis/Variant4ca38d27ccc1ce90f2b7ce32367ed1836f50ca5bd69206a2ed05900284a91ad2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TryThis/Variant4ca38d27ccc1ce90f2b7ce32367ed1836f50ca5bd69206a2ed05900284a91ad2.lean#L286).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `047f4a796962819a09262824ed17a9f77dec38c6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
