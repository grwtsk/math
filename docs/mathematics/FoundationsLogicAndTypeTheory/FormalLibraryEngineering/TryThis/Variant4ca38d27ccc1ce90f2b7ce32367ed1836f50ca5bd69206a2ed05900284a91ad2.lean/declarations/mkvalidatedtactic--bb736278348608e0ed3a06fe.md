## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9b3dbf4f93c131f701d31691d64ff60a8809d3ae6eeb3496114c1e14d3a4d2fc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 180–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def mkValidatedTactic (tac : TSyntax `tactic) (msg : MessageData)
    (initialState : Tactic.SavedState) (expectedType? : Option Expr := none) :
    TacticM (Option (TSyntax `tactic × MessageData)) := do
  try
    evalTacticWithState initialState tac expectedType?
    return some (tac, msg)
  catch _ =>
    -- Note: we must use `(expose_names; _)` and not `· expose_names; _` to avoid generating
    -- spurious tactic-abort exceptions, since these tactics may not close the goal
    let tac ← `(tactic| (expose_names; $tac))
    try
      evalTacticWithState initialState tac expectedType?
      return some (tac, m!"(expose_names; {msg})")
    catch _ =>
      return none

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TryThis/Variant4ca38d27ccc1ce90f2b7ce32367ed1836f50ca5bd69206a2ed05900284a91ad2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TryThis/Variant4ca38d27ccc1ce90f2b7ce32367ed1836f50ca5bd69206a2ed05900284a91ad2.lean#L180).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `047f4a796962819a09262824ed17a9f77dec38c6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
