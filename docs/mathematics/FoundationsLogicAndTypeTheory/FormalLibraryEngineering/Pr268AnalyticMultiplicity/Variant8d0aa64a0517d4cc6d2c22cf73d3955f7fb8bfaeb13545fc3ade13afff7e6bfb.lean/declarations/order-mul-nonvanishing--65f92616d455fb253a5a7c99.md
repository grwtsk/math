## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:376b3cf0-f5cb-82f9-a7f9-fb1ad08bcf82`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 31–38.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem order_mul_nonvanishing {f c : ℂ → ℂ} {z : ℂ}
    (hf : AnalyticAt ℂ f z) (hc : AnalyticAt ℂ c z) (hc0 : c z ≠ 0) :
    analyticOrderAt (fun w ↦ c w * f w) z = analyticOrderAt f z := by
  simpa only [Pi.mul_def, hc.analyticOrderAt_eq_zero.mpr hc0, zero_add] using
    analyticOrderAt_mul hc hf

/-- A literal local source identity transports multiplicity through its
nonvanishing normalization. Equality merely of zero sets is not a premise. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Pr268AnalyticMultiplicity/Variant8d0aa64a0517d4cc6d2c22cf73d3955f7fb8bfaeb13545fc3ade13afff7e6bfb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Pr268AnalyticMultiplicity/Variant8d0aa64a0517d4cc6d2c22cf73d3955f7fb8bfaeb13545fc3ade13afff7e6bfb.lean#L31).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7b41e4d160b234acbc473a4191b97753739dbc68` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
