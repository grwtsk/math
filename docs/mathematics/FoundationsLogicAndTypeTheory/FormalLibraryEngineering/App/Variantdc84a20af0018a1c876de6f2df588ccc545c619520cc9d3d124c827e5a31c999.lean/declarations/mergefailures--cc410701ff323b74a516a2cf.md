## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:93525664d2e63cdcc9d191dbe6cb508ffac37dddb18d009d21cc14e449154585`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2198–2209.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def mergeFailures (failures : Array (TermElabResult Expr)) : TermElabM α := do
  let exs := failures.map fun | .error ex _ => ex | _ => unreachable!
  let trees := failures.map (fun | .error _ s => s.meta.core.infoState.trees | _ => unreachable!)
    |>.filterMap (·[0]?)
  -- Retain partial `InfoTree` subtrees in an `.ofChoiceInfo` node in case of multiple failures.
  -- This ensures that the language server still has `Info` to work with when multiple overloaded
  -- elaborators fail.
  withInfoContext (mkInfo := pure <| .ofChoiceInfo { elaborator := .anonymous, stx := ← getRef }) do
    for tree in trees do
      pushInfoTree tree
  throwErrorWithNestedErrors "overloaded" exs

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/App/Variantdc84a20af0018a1c876de6f2df588ccc545c619520cc9d3d124c827e5a31c999.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/App/Variantdc84a20af0018a1c876de6f2df588ccc545c619520cc9d3d124c827e5a31c999.lean#L2198).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e4839efc829596a2e83bcbf82e29d63c4502e727` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
