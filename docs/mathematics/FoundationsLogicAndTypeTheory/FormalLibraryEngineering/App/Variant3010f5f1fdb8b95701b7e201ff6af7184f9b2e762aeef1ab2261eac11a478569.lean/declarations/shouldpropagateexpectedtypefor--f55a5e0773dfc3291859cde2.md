## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:adb8cc6708d0966f9c10e5a48caecac04e1328537ecc029bd5c428b234e134e6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 516–562.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/--
  Auxiliary method for propagating the expected type. We call it as soon as we find the first explicit
  argument. The goal is to propagate the expected type in applications of functions such as
  ```lean
  Add.add {α : Type u} : α → α → α
  List.cons {α : Type u} : α → List α → List α
  ```
  This is particularly useful when there applicable coercions. For example,
  assume we have a coercion from `Nat` to `Int`, and we have
  `(x : Nat)` and the expected type is `List Int`. Then, if we don't use this function,
  the elaborator will fail to elaborate
  ```
  List.cons x []
  ```
  First, the elaborator creates a new metavariable `?α` for the implicit argument `{α : Type u}`.
  Then, when it processes `x`, it assigns `?α := Nat`, and then obtains the
  resultant type `List Nat` which is **not** definitionally equal to `List Int`.
  We solve the problem by executing this method before we elaborate the first explicit argument (`x` in this example).
  This method infers that the resultant type is `List ?α` and unifies it with `List Int`.
  Then, when we elaborate `x`, the elaborate realizes the coercion from `Nat` to `Int` must be used, and the
  term
  ```
  @List.cons Int (coe x) (@List.nil Int)
  ```
  is produced.

  The method will do nothing if
  1- The resultant type depends on the remaining arguments (i.e., `!eTypeBody.hasLooseBVars`).
  2- The resultant type contains optional/auto params.

  We have considered adding the following extra conditions
    a) The resultant type does not contain any type metavariable.
    b) The resultant type contains a non-type metavariable.

  These two conditions would restrict the method to simple functions that are "morally" in
  the Hindley&Milner fragment.
  If users need to disable expected type propagation, we can add an attribute `[elab_without_expected_type]`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/App/Variant3010f5f1fdb8b95701b7e201ff6af7184f9b2e762aeef1ab2261eac11a478569.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/App/Variant3010f5f1fdb8b95701b7e201ff6af7184f9b2e762aeef1ab2261eac11a478569.lean#L516).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
