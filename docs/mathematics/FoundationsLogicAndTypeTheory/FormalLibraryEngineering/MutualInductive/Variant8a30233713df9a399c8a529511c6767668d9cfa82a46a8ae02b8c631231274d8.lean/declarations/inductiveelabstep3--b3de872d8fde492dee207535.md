## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:71603b0af41fe257aea3504898e2cb4643c0b6e50dd320fc787d817db0e115d4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 128–133.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure InductiveElabStep3 where
  /-- Finalize the inductive type, after they are all added to the environment, after auxiliary definitions are added, and after computed fields are registered.
  The `levelParams`, `params`, and `replaceIndFVars` arguments of `prefinalize` are still valid here. -/
  finalize : TermElabM Unit := pure ()

/-- An intermediate step for mutual inductive elaboration. See `InductiveElabDescr`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MutualInductive/Variant8a30233713df9a399c8a529511c6767668d9cfa82a46a8ae02b8c631231274d8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MutualInductive/Variant8a30233713df9a399c8a529511c6767668d9cfa82a46a8ae02b8c631231274d8.lean#L128).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `70adc2c0ca9bfa1e7a54b5e64de2521494b71cb3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
