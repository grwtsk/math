## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f330449698ce0f4f6572e92eed57f8653d4086ddb4c820041820e9afbd7b269e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1105–1123.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def levelMVarToParamAtInductives
    (indTypes : List InductiveType) (typeLMVarIds : Array LMVarId) (resultUniv : ResultingUniverseResult) :
    TermElabM Unit := do
  let rmvarId? := resultUniv.assign?.map (fun (mvarId, _) => mvarId)
  indTypes.forM fun indType => do
    discard <| Term.levelMVarToParam indType.type (except := fun mvar => rmvarId? == some mvar)
    if rmvarId?.isSome then
      -- Hasn't been assigned, so be sure to visit full resulting universe level
      discard <| Term.levelMVarToParam (mkSort resultUniv.u)
    indType.ctors.forM fun ctor => do
      discard <| Term.levelMVarToParam ctor.type (except := fun mvar => rmvarId? == some mvar || !typeLMVarIds.contains mvar)

end LevelInference

/--
Heuristic: users don't tend to want types that are universe polymorphic across both `Prop` and `Type _`.
This can be disabled by setting the option `bootstrap.inductiveCheckResultingUniverse` to false,
unless one of the inductive commands requires it (for instance `structure` due to projections).

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MutualInductive/Variant8a30233713df9a399c8a529511c6767668d9cfa82a46a8ae02b8c631231274d8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MutualInductive/Variant8a30233713df9a399c8a529511c6767668d9cfa82a46a8ae02b8c631231274d8.lean#L1105).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `70adc2c0ca9bfa1e7a54b5e64de2521494b71cb3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
