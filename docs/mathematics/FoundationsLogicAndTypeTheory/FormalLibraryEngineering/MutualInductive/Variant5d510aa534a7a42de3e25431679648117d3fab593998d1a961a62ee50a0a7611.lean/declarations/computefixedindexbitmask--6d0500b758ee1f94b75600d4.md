## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:67b27e0c24a59e09abf334bf1f7e36af8cf1c31bc327e63808097915a3cb302f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 517–559.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
private def computeFixedIndexBitMask (numParams : Nat) (indType : InductiveType) (indFVars : Array Expr) : MetaM (Array Bool) := do
  let arity ← getArity indType
  if arity ≤ numParams then
    return .replicate arity false
  else
    let maskRef ← IO.mkRef (.replicate numParams false ++ .replicate (arity - numParams) true)
    let rec go (ctors : List Constructor) : MetaM (Array Bool) := do
      match ctors with
      | [] => maskRef.get
      | ctor :: ctors =>
        forallTelescopeReducing ctor.type fun xs type => do
          let typeArgs := type.getAppArgs
          for i in numParams...arity do
            unless i < xs.size && xs[i]! == typeArgs[i]! do -- Remark: if we want to allow arguments to be rearranged, this test should be xs.contains typeArgs[i]
              maskRef.modify fun mask => mask.set! i false
          for x in xs[numParams...*] do
            let xType ← inferType x
            let cond (e : Expr) := indFVars.any (fun indFVar => e.getAppFn == indFVar)
            xType.forEachWhere (stopWhenVisited := true) cond fun e => do
              let eArgs := e.getAppArgs
              for i in numParams...eArgs.size do
                if i >= typeArgs.size then
                  maskRef.modify (resetMaskAt · i)
                else
                  unless eArgs[i]! == typeArgs[i]! do
                    maskRef.modify (resetMaskAt · i)
              /-If an index is missing in the arguments of the inductive type, then it must be non-fixed.
                Consider the following example:
                ```lean
                inductive All {I : Type u} (P : I → Type v) : List I → Type (max u v) where
                  | cons : P x → All P xs → All P (x :: xs)

                inductive Iμ {I : Type u}  : I → Type (max u v) where
                  | mk : (i : I)  → All Iμ [] → Iμ i
                ```
                because `i` doesn't appear in `All Iμ []`, the index shouldn't be fixed.
              -/
              for i in eArgs.size...arity do
                maskRef.modify (resetMaskAt · i)
        go ctors
    go indType.ctors

/-- Return true iff `arrowType` is an arrow and its domain is defeq to `type` -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MutualInductive/Variant5d510aa534a7a42de3e25431679648117d3fab593998d1a961a62ee50a0a7611.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MutualInductive/Variant5d510aa534a7a42de3e25431679648117d3fab593998d1a961a62ee50a0a7611.lean#L517).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2f896ef31359aad0ee273d30032f02e843781076` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
