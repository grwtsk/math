## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6a5e186f95f4224f4289a0e4fbd19145c93c664e471500a53c40da02520b81a7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 583–598.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def canonicalIndexSerializerExample : CanonicalIndexSerializer :=
  { normalize := fun _ => canonicalIndexSnapshotExample
    encode := fun _ => ByteArray.empty
    digest := fun _ =>
      ⟨"sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855"⟩
    normalized := fun index =>
      index = canonicalIndexSnapshotExample ∧ index.Valid
    normalize_normalized := by
      intro _
      exact ⟨rfl, canonicalIndexSnapshotExample_valid⟩
    deterministic := by
      intro left right same
      cases same
      rfl }

/-- Exact concrete representation certificate from normalization through digest. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Examples/Variant498db484675ecf52fa34065fa8cee422204b5f880bc3292d51f19a9ffa81c6e1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Examples/Variant498db484675ecf52fa34065fa8cee422204b5f880bc3292d51f19a9ffa81c6e1.lean#L583).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f1cee72955f7de1fde3b7fdc793eec5409b3c8b8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
