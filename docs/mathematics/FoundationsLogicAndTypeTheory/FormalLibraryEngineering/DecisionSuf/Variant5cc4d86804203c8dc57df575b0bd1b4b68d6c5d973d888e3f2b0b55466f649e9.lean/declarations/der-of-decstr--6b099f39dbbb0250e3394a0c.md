## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:709620d1-00d0-f738-9a67-5a224baa549e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 342–363.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem der_of_decstr {en : Miustr} (h : Decstr en) : Derivable en := by
  /- The next three lines have the effect of introducing `count U en` as a variable that can be used
   for induction -/
  have hu : ∃ n, count U en = n := exists_eq'
  cases' hu with n hu
  revert en -- Crucially, we need the induction hypothesis to quantify over `en`
  induction' n with k hk
  · exact base_case_suf _
  · intro ys hdec hus
    rcases ind_hyp_suf k ys hus hdec with ⟨as, bs, hyab, habuc, hdecab⟩
    have h₂ : Derivable (↑(M :: as) ++ ↑[I, I, I] ++ bs) := hk hdecab habuc
    rw [hyab]

### Decidability of `Derivable`

/-- Finally, we have the main result, namely that `Derivable` is a decidable predicate.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DecisionSuf/Variant5cc4d86804203c8dc57df575b0bd1b4b68d6c5d973d888e3f2b0b55466f649e9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DecisionSuf/Variant5cc4d86804203c8dc57df575b0bd1b4b68d6c5d973d888e3f2b0b55466f649e9.lean#L342).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7f9fdaba0ac4a47920111ecc621f72e3c5636dae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
