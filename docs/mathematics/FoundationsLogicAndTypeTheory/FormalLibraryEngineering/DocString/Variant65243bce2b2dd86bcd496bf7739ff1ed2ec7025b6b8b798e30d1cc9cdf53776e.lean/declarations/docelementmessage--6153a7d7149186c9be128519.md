## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dd2e9e92d6b50b6a7bc23a4644cce323ca22d89b245d3538cc52524585aa5c05`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1893–1915.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def docElementMessage (extension : Name) : BaseIO MessageData := do
  if (← isBuiltin) then
    match extension with
    | .str _ s => return s
    | _ => return .ofConstName extension
  else
    return .ofConstName extension
where
  isBuiltin : BaseIO Bool := do
    return (← builtinDocRoles.get).contains extension ||
      (← builtinDocCodeBlocks.get).contains extension ||
      (← builtinDocDirectives.get).contains extension ||
      (← builtinDocCommands.get).contains extension

/--
Registers a single `MVarErrorInfo` so that, if any metavariable in `e` remains unresolved at the
end of document elaboration, one error is emitted at `ref` naming the documentation `extension` (the
constant implementing the role/code block, e.g. `Lean.Doc.given`) and the supplied `location`
(e.g. "type of variable `xs`") that contained the hole. The element name is rendered via
`docElementMessage`. Roles and code blocks use this to attach a diagnostic to the syntax
that introduced the variable, in addition to the standard placeholder errors that the underlying
elaborator emits for unsolved metas.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DocString/Variant65243bce2b2dd86bcd496bf7739ff1ed2ec7025b6b8b798e30d1cc9cdf53776e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DocString/Variant65243bce2b2dd86bcd496bf7739ff1ed2ec7025b6b8b798e30d1cc9cdf53776e.lean#L1893).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e6af04853ba13c2d50a909dfaed37219dc95f7eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
