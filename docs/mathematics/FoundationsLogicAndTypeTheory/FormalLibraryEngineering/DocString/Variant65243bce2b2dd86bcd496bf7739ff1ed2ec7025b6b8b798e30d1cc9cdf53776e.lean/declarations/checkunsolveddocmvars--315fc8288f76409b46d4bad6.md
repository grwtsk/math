## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:384a17fc103bf982eb24eebacdb4a1842f6554addbb8dc72426a0f28e3414786`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 209–223.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def checkUnsolvedDocMVars (initialLctx : LocalContext) (docState : State) :
    TermElabM Unit := do
  let mut pending : Array MVarId := #[]
  for decl in docState.lctx do
    unless initialLctx.containsFVar (.fvar decl.fvarId) do
      pending := pending ++ (← Meta.getMVars (← instantiateMVars decl.type))
      if let some v := decl.value? then
        pending := pending ++ (← Meta.getMVars (← instantiateMVars v))
  unless pending.isEmpty do
    discard <| Term.logUnassignedUsingErrorInfos pending

/--
Runs a `TermElabM` action, saving and restoring the term elaboration state so that metavariables
and other state changes do not leak. Messages produced by the action are preserved.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DocString/Variant65243bce2b2dd86bcd496bf7739ff1ed2ec7025b6b8b798e30d1cc9cdf53776e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DocString/Variant65243bce2b2dd86bcd496bf7739ff1ed2ec7025b6b8b798e30d1cc9cdf53776e.lean#L209).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e6af04853ba13c2d50a909dfaed37219dc95f7eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
