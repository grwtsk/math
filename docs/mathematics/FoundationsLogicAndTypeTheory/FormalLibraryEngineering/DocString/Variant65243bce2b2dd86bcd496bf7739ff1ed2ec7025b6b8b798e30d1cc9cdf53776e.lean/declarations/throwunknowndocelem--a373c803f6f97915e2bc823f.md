## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c073a397903d970361abec77367b7ca0e8507d889e8faeeab4565f2006659d68`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1473–1486.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def throwUnknownDocElem {α β : Type}
    (envEntries : NameMap (Array Name)) (builtins : NameMap α)
    (name : Ident) (kind : String) : DocM β := do
  let hint ← shadowedHint envEntries builtins name kind
  let resolved? ← try some <$> realizeGlobalConstNoOverload name catch | _ => pure none
  if let some resolved := resolved? then
    let info ← getConstInfo resolved
    throwErrorAt name m!"`{name} : {info.type}` is not registered as a {kind}{hint}"
  else
    throwErrorAt name m!"Unknown {kind} `{name}`{hint}"

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DocString/Variant65243bce2b2dd86bcd496bf7739ff1ed2ec7025b6b8b798e30d1cc9cdf53776e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DocString/Variant65243bce2b2dd86bcd496bf7739ff1ed2ec7025b6b8b798e30d1cc9cdf53776e.lean#L1473).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e6af04853ba13c2d50a909dfaed37219dc95f7eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
