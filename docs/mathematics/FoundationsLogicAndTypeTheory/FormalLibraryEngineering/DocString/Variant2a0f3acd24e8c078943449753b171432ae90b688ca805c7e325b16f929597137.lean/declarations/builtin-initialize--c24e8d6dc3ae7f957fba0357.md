## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `builtin_initialize` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:60eb760a78602075f3386062bd6ac7f8cd97498d49f2da399d3d493100371f72`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 801–819.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
builtin_initialize registerBuiltinAttribute {
  name := `doc_code_suggestions
  descr := "docstring code element suggestion provider"
  applicationTime := .afterCompilation
  add := fun decl stx kind => do
    if let some d := (← getEnv).find? decl then
      if d.type matches (.forallE _ (.const ``StrLit _)
          (.app (.const ``DocM _) (.app (.const ``Array _) (.const ``CodeSuggestion _)))
          .default) then
        codeSuggestionExt.add decl
      else
        throwError "Wrong type for {.ofConstName decl}: {indentD <| repr d.type}"
    else
      throwError "{.ofConstName decl} is not defined"
}

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DocString/Variant2a0f3acd24e8c078943449753b171432ae90b688ca805c7e325b16f929597137.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DocString/Variant2a0f3acd24e8c078943449753b171432ae90b688ca805c7e325b16f929597137.lean#L801).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `014689ae16d0f21928edb8900d54e926c7b9471b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
