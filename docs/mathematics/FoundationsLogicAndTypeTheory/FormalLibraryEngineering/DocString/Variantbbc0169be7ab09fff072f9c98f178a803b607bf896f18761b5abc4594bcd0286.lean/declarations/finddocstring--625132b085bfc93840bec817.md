## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1f3a6da4fd700b6984084a4118136dd8399756cac8d6d5c61c6856ad936744d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 35–51.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def findDocString? (env : Environment) (declName : Name) (includeBuiltin := true)
    (options : Options := {}) (currNamespace : Name := .anonymous) (openDecls : List OpenDecl := []) :
    IO (Option String) := do
  let declName := alternativeOfTactic env declName |>.getD declName
  let exts := getTacticExtensionString env declName
  let spellings := getRecommendedSpellingString env declName
  let str := (← findSimpleDocString? env declName (includeBuiltin := includeBuiltin)
      (options := options) (currNamespace := currNamespace) (openDecls := openDecls)).map
    (· ++ exts ++ spellings)
  str.mapM (rewriteManualLinks ·)

/--
Finds the docstring for a name, taking the current namespace and open declarations from the ambient
monad. Tactic alternate forms and documentation extensions are taken into account.

Docstrings are rendered with the default options.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DocString/Variantbbc0169be7ab09fff072f9c98f178a803b607bf896f18761b5abc4594bcd0286.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DocString/Variantbbc0169be7ab09fff072f9c98f178a803b607bf896f18761b5abc4594bcd0286.lean#L35).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cc15f7226f98c7c2b900160f16aa982213b16197` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
