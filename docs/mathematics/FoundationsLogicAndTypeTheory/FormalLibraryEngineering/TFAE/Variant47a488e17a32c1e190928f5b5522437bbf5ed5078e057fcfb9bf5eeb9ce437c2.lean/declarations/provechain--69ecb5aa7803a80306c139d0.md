## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bfef81d2c0c791292d1c7b04dc83b65a94f34cff3af8fc6edc6eef293a5f3011`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 212–223.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def proveChain (i : ℕ) (is : List ℕ) (P : Q(Prop)) (l : Q(List Prop)) :
    MetaM Q(IsChain (· → ·) ($P :: $l)) := do
  match l with
  | ~q([]) => return q(.singleton _)
  | ~q($P' :: $l') =>
    -- `id` is a workaround for https://github.com/leanprover-community/quote4/issues/30
    let i' :: is' := id is | unreachable!
    have cl' : Q(IsChain (· → ·) ($P' :: $l')) := ← proveChain i' is' q($P') q($l')
    let p ← proveImpl hyps atoms i i' P P'
    return q(.cons_cons $p $cl')

/-- Attempt to prove `getLastD l P' → P` given an explicit list `l`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TFAE/Variant47a488e17a32c1e190928f5b5522437bbf5ed5078e057fcfb9bf5eeb9ce437c2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TFAE/Variant47a488e17a32c1e190928f5b5522437bbf5ed5078e057fcfb9bf5eeb9ce437c2.lean#L212).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f795d1b2b4505dc6ff086fa3d8255955ede0ff2c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
