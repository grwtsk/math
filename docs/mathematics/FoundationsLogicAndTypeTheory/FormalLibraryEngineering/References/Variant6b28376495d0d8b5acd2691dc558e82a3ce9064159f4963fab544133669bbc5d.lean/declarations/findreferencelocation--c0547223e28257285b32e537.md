## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8f9e96a6238493a5bba809fdad512f4b4646998cc782ebbcaff1bc8e1dc4c695`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 160–176.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def findReferenceLocation?
    (self        : RefInfo)
    (pos         : Lsp.Position)
    (includeStop : Bool := false)
    : Option Location := do
  if let some loc := self.definition? then
    if contains loc.range pos then
      return loc
  for loc in self.usages do
    if contains loc.range pos then
      return loc
  none
where
  contains (range : Lsp.Range) (pos : Lsp.Position) : Bool :=
    range.start <= pos && (if includeStop then pos <= range.end else pos < range.end)

/-- Checks whether any of the ranges in `self.definition?` or `self.usages` contains `pos`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/References/Variant6b28376495d0d8b5acd2691dc558e82a3ce9064159f4963fab544133669bbc5d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/References/Variant6b28376495d0d8b5acd2691dc558e82a3ce9064159f4963fab544133669bbc5d.lean#L160).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `633baf65e182b269ae7d068ca67b5ef31f1e07ad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
