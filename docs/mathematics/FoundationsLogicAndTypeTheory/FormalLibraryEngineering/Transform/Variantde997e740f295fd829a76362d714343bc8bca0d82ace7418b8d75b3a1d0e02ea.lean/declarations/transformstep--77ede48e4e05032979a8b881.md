## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:108a6d0875c22e99a7aee65cc34a371f64505f20da65bd78c13a6b1a01f766b9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 13–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive TransformStep where
  /-- Return expression without visiting any subexpressions. -/
  | done (e : Expr)
  /--
  Visit expression (which should be different from current expression) instead.
  The new expression `e` is passed to `pre` again.
  -/
  | visit (e : Expr)
  /--
  Continue transformation with the given expression (defaults to current expression).
  For `pre`, this means visiting the children of the expression.
  For `post`, this is equivalent to returning `done`. -/
  | continue (e? : Option Expr := none)
  deriving Inhabited, Repr

namespace Core

/--
Recursively transforms `input` using `pre` and `post` callbacks.

For each subexpression:
1. `pre` is invoked first; recursion continues according to the `TransformStep` result.
2. After recursion (if any), `post` is invoked on the resulting expression.

The expressions passed to `pre` and `post` may contain loose bound variables.
Use `Meta.transform` instead if you need operations like `whnf` or `inferType`
that require expressions without loose bound variables.

Results are cached using pointer equality (`ExprStructEq`), so structurally
identical subexpressions are transformed only once.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Transform/Variantde997e740f295fd829a76362d714343bc8bca0d82ace7418b8d75b3a1d0e02ea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Transform/Variantde997e740f295fd829a76362d714343bc8bca0d82ace7418b8d75b3a1d0e02ea.lean#L13).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e526c71d75395cac41b2cf2e6bbaddf166cb5eb5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
