## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8451bf8ebb173095c261bbe2a52227a1628c7ded96b2e1c29bc623e18caa039c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 75–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def betaReduce (e : Expr) : CoreM Expr :=
  transform e (pre := fun e => return if e.isHeadBetaTarget then .visit e.headBeta else .continue)

end Core

namespace Meta

/--
Like `Meta.transform`, but accepts and returns a cache for reuse across multiple calls.

Parameters:
- `usedLetOnly`: when true, `mkLambdaFVars`/`mkForallFVars`/`mkLetFVars` only abstract
  over variables that are actually used in the body.
- `skipConstInApp`: when true, constant heads in applications are not visited separately.
- `skipInstances`: when true, instance arguments (determined via `getFunInfo`) are not visited.

The `skipInstances` flag is used by `dsimp` to avoid rewriting instances.

**Warnings:**
- The cache is only valid when using the same `pre` and `post` functions.
- Ensure there are no other references to `cache` to avoid unnecessary hash map copying.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Transform/Variantde997e740f295fd829a76362d714343bc8bca0d82ace7418b8d75b3a1d0e02ea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Transform/Variantde997e740f295fd829a76362d714343bc8bca0d82ace7418b8d75b3a1d0e02ea.lean#L75).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e526c71d75395cac41b2cf2e6bbaddf166cb5eb5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
