## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:27899df31087ea9aeead61fd3c9edc1be90330018e95b641213ef6efc8f7f3b3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 310–324.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def normEDSRec' {P : ℕ → Sort u}
    (zero : P 0) (one : P 1) (two : P 2) (three : P 3) (four : P 4)
    (even : ∀ m : ℕ, (∀ k < 2 * (m + 3), P k) → P (2 * (m + 3)))
    (odd : ∀ m : ℕ, (∀ k < 2 * (m + 2) + 1, P k) → P (2 * (m + 2) + 1)) (n : ℕ) : P n :=
  n.evenOddStrongRec (by rintro (_ | _ | _ | _) h; exacts [zero, two, four, even _ h])
    (by rintro (_ | _ | _) h; exacts [one, three, odd _ h])

/-- Recursion principle for a normalised EDS: if we have
* `P 0`, `P 1`, `P 2`, `P 3`, and `P 4`,
* for all `m : ℕ` we can prove `P (2 * (m + 3))` from `P (m + 1)`, `P (m + 2)`, `P (m + 3)`,
  `P (m + 4)`, and `P (m + 5)`, and
* for all `m : ℕ` we can prove `P (2 * (m + 2) + 1)` from `P (m + 1)`, `P (m + 2)`, `P (m + 3)`,
  and `P (m + 4)`,
then we have `P n` for all `n : ℕ`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/EllipticDivisibilitySequence/Variant1f6e0afb444a290e92d1c8a65cbc5e198e8e40deacb40ca57c487d4c00a1731e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/EllipticDivisibilitySequence/Variant1f6e0afb444a290e92d1c8a65cbc5e198e8e40deacb40ca57c487d4c00a1731e.lean#L310).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6eb14bce94feda3db5bdcc8e47376d5db46668bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
