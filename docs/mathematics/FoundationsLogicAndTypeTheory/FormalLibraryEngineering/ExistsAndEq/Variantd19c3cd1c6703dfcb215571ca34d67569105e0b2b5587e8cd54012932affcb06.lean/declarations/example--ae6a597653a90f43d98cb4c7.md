## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6c5702d9c0bdf3214bb3b629cc59d61ea779f685afc3eb2ee561adeedc4ae627`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 68–90.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example (P Q : α × β → Prop) (a : α × β) :
    (∃ b : (α × β), (P b ∧ b = a) ∧ Q b) ↔ P a ∧ Q a := by
  simp

-- # Metavariables in goals

-- The simproc must return a closed proof even when the goal contains metavariables, which is what
-- `aesop` presents to it: here the goal is `∃ a : Nat, a = Nat.succ ?b ∧ 0 < ?b`.
open Lean Meta Qq in
#eval show MetaM Unit from do
  let b : Q(Nat) ← mkFreshExprMVarQ q(Nat)
  let e : Q(Prop) := q(∃ a : Nat, a = Nat.succ $b ∧ 0 < $b)
  let simprocs ← ({} : Simprocs).add ``ExistsAndEq.existsAndEq (post := false)
  let (r, _) ← Simp.main e (← Simp.mkContext) (methods := Simp.mkDefaultMethodsCore #[simprocs])
  let some pf := r.proof? | throwError "the simproc did not fire"
  let pf ← instantiateMVars pf
  let leftover := (← getMVars pf).filter (· != b.mvarId!)
  unless leftover.isEmpty do
    throwError "metavariables left in the proof: {leftover.map mkMVar}\n{pf}"

-- Metavariables may depend on each other: here `?f : Nat → ?β`, and `?β` occurs in the goal too
-- (as it arises when `simpa using` simplifies the type of a term whose implicit arguments are not
-- determined yet). They have to be handled consistently.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExistsAndEq/Variantd19c3cd1c6703dfcb215571ca34d67569105e0b2b5587e8cd54012932affcb06.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExistsAndEq/Variantd19c3cd1c6703dfcb215571ca34d67569105e0b2b5587e8cd54012932affcb06.lean#L68).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f86269f4c5c19db15fd8c858ed5d49e8bba7cc75` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
