## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f15c0daf097eabf3d10e9d9a4662649181b88f51a3f7816cf896cc08b3d97a3d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 149–158.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Path.forResult (path : Path) : Path :=
  let (quantifiers, conjunctions) := path.partition (· == .existsBody)
  quantifiers ++ conjunctions

/-- Destructs `h : P` following `path`, as the chain of `refine h.elim fun … ↦ ?_` in the docstring
of `mkBeforeToAfter` does: at an `existsBody` step the quantifier is unpacked with `Exists.elim`,
using the next variable of `exs` as the bound variable; at an `andLeft`/`andRight` step the
conjunction is split with `And.elim`, and the part outside the path becomes a *leaf*. The
continuation `k` receives the leaves (in path order, after those in `acc`) and the hypothesis at
the end of the path, i.e. the equation. All of them are local hypotheses. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExistsAndEq/Variant35f2d258e5c11d2f6e361da8a617ea8d55062467e9ec8d8637c266bd82958bd7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExistsAndEq/Variant35f2d258e5c11d2f6e361da8a617ea8d55062467e9ec8d8637c266bd82958bd7.lean#L149).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `35b2a2071b9d3b88e9247b3ac0e2bfdb0ed43f60` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
