## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:497c73db9187c05b30a14553207e2026c699c11de159e3b3601e94b4e017c2b0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def PostconditionT.bind {m : Type w → Type w'} [Monad m] {α : Type w} {β : Type w}
    (x : PostconditionT m α) (f : α → PostconditionT m β) : PostconditionT m β :=
  ⟨fun b => ∃ a, x.Property a ∧ (f a).Property b,
    x.operation >>= fun a =>
      (fun b =>
        ⟨b.val, a.val, a.property, b.property⟩) <$> (f a).operation⟩

/--
A version of `bind` that provides a proof of the previous postcondition to the mapping function.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PostconditionMonad/Variant391100e26e49497ea7aff12360ef25a4be28829ad0c73dfec0d25908930360a5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PostconditionMonad/Variant391100e26e49497ea7aff12360ef25a4be28829ad0c73dfec0d25908930360a5.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93361a83e8c3cacad91d1e90687ef4732e90cf2f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
