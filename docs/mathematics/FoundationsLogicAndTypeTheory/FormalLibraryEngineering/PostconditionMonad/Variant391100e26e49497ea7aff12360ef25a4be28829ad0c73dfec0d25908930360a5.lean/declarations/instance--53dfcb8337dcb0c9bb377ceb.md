## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:453c782cbbb641b1c0888d306ee66f85c9c2d00fb6c3e801b3a2288185ef9c20`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 208–220.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [Monad m] [LawfulMonad m] : LawfulMonad (PostconditionT m) where
  map_const {α β} := by ext a x; simp [Functor.mapConst, Functor.map]
  id_map {α} x := by simp [Functor.map]
  comp_map {α β γ} g h := by intro x; simp [Functor.map]; rfl
  seqLeft_eq {α β} x y := by simp [SeqLeft.seqLeft, Functor.map, Seq.seq]; rfl
  seqRight_eq {α β} x y := by simp [Seq.seq, SeqRight.seqRight, Functor.map]
  pure_seq g x := by simp [Seq.seq, Functor.map]
  bind_pure_comp f x := by simp [Functor.map, Bind.bind]; rfl
  bind_map f x := by simp [Seq.seq, Functor.map]; rfl
  pure_bind x f := PostconditionT.pure_bind
  bind_assoc x f g := PostconditionT.bind_assoc

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PostconditionMonad/Variant391100e26e49497ea7aff12360ef25a4be28829ad0c73dfec0d25908930360a5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PostconditionMonad/Variant391100e26e49497ea7aff12360ef25a4be28829ad0c73dfec0d25908930360a5.lean#L208).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93361a83e8c3cacad91d1e90687ef4732e90cf2f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
