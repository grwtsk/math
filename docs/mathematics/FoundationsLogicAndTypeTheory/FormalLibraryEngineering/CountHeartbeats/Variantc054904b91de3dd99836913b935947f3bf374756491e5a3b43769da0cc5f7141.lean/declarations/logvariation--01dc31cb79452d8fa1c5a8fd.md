## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c40e381a99938a6ffa42c099e4ea4d53f632fe3110059a80f634650fc43e1915`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–66.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def logVariation {m} [Monad m] [MonadLog m] [AddMessageContext m] [MonadOptions m]
    (counts : List Nat) : m Unit := do
  if let [min, max, stddev] := variation counts then
  -- convert `[min, max, stddev]` to user-facing heartbeats
  logInfo s!"Min: {min / 1000} Max: {max / 1000} StdDev: {stddev / 10}%"

/-- Count the heartbeats used by a tactic, e.g.: `#count_heartbeats simp`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CountHeartbeats/Variantc054904b91de3dd99836913b935947f3bf374756491e5a3b43769da0cc5f7141.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CountHeartbeats/Variantc054904b91de3dd99836913b935947f3bf374756491e5a3b43769da0cc5f7141.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `677e6962677f87071b4941fcf2f306b3486a20f6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
