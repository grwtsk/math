## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5408a8bea776399715f0b3db04e94633b67b808320b873e7dbdea24261e0ec2f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 199–216.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
def elabForHeartbeats (cmd : TSyntax `command) (revert : Bool := true) : CommandElabM Nat := do
  let start ← IO.getNumHeartbeats
  let s ← get
  elabCommand (← `(command| set_option Elab.async false in set_option maxHeartbeats 0 in $cmd))
  if revert then set s
  return (← IO.getNumHeartbeats) - start

/--
`#count_heartbeats! in cmd` runs a command `10` times, reporting the range in heartbeats, and the
standard deviation. The command `#count_heartbeats! n in cmd` runs it `n` times instead.

Example usage:
```
#count_heartbeats! in
def f := 37
```
displays the info message `Min: 7 Max: 8 StdDev: 14%`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CountHeartbeats/Variant49c7e5b4853be49a6f34d10f4dc3fa162e5e35fb425979afe91d12d89c03032e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CountHeartbeats/Variant49c7e5b4853be49a6f34d10f4dc3fa162e5e35fb425979afe91d12d89c03032e.lean#L199).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bdd59548ea7aee17214e1c5a95e49c1a2c3cd52d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
