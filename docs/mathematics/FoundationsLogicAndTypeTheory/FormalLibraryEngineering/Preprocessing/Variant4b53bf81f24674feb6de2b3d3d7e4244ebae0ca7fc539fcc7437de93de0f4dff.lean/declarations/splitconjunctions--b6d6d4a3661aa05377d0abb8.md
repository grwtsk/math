## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b50a97a7c87305ae34cb0be2ebf09a69b643262d062b022d297c7b839d4ed144`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 48–62.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def splitConjunctions : Preprocessor where
  description := "split conjunctions"
  transform := aux
where
  /-- Implementation of the `splitConjunctions` preprocessor. -/
  aux (proof : Expr) : MetaM (List Expr) := do
    match (← instantiateMVars (← inferType proof)).getAppFnArgs with
    | (``And, #[_, _]) =>
      pure ((← aux (← mkAppM ``And.left #[proof])) ++
        (← aux (← mkAppM ``And.right #[proof])))
    | _ => pure [proof]

/--
Removes any expressions that are not proofs of inequalities, equalities, or negations thereof.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Preprocessing/Variant4b53bf81f24674feb6de2b3d3d7e4244ebae0ca7fc539fcc7437de93de0f4dff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Preprocessing/Variant4b53bf81f24674feb6de2b3d3d7e4244ebae0ca7fc539fcc7437de93de0f4dff.lean#L48).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6b40e715096eaebaaeb323e6d9f4619065d1cfe2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
