## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:28a3b161d2d0cea20ea4371f9d9b141e0e80ec6825d57e758b4ff9c1925e47d8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–84.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def filterComparisons : Preprocessor where
  name := "filter terms that are not proofs of comparisons"
  transform h := do
    let tp ← whnfR (← instantiateMVars (← inferType h))
    if (← isProp tp) && (← aux tp) then pure [h]
    else pure []
where
  /-- Implementation of the `filterComparisons` preprocessor. -/
  aux (e : Expr) : MetaM Bool := do
  match e.getAppFnArgs with
  | (``Eq, _) | (``LE.le, _) | (``LT.lt, _) => pure true
  | (``Not, #[e]) => match (← whnfR e).getAppFnArgs with
    | (``LE.le, _) | (``LT.lt, _) => pure true
    | _ => pure false
  | _ => pure false

section removeNegations

/--
If `prf` is a proof of `¬ e`, where `e` is a comparison,
`flipNegatedComparison prf e` flips the comparison in `e` and returns a proof.
For example, if `prf : ¬ a < b`, ``flipNegatedComparison prf q(a < b)`` returns a proof of `a ≥ b`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Preprocessing/Variant0408194cfb6b65436f3bed5a863d7cfa2839ccae8ea713c4c836cda31d19b8ae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Preprocessing/Variant0408194cfb6b65436f3bed5a863d7cfa2839ccae8ea713c4c836cda31d19b8ae.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `65f7708366e946e8d3a9150f43096b597113bd93` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
