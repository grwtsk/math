## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:da2e6559-78da-d80c-47a3-2da17a048303`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 925–935.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cons_same (he : Compatible Γ σ τ) (D n : Expr S) :
    Compatible (D :: Γ) (Expr.consSub n σ) (Expr.consSub n τ) := he.cons (.refl n)
end Compatible
end ContextTower.TypedSubstitution

namespace ObservationValues
variable {S : Type u} {P : Specification S} (Ω : ContextTower P) (C : Set (Set S))
variable (hw : SystemWeaklyNormalizing P)
include hw

open Classical in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Congruence/Variant948abe95f4d63c9d8d8c2daf3bfc5f37971a17327c2231290ac34f190f3ea882.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Congruence/Variant948abe95f4d63c9d8d8c2daf3bfc5f37971a17327c2231290ac34f190f3ea882.lean#L925).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fc8b46f226b462286f2b1ca9f76a4d37bb84c64a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
