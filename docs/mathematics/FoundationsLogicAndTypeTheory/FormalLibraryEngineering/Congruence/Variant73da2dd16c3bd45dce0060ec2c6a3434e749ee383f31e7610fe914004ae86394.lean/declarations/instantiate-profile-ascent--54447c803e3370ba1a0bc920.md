## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:595f7977-e3be-c6b1-ddee-89bc61d0bb8d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1127–1137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem instantiate_profile_ascent {Γ : List (Expr S)} {D E n : Expr S} {s : S}
    (hp : PureTypeSystem.HasType P Γ (.pi D E) (.sort s))
    (hn : PureTypeSystem.HasType P Γ n D) {σ : Nat → Expr S} (hσ : Ω.TypedSubstitution Γ σ) :
    PositivePath (PrimaryEdge P) (Ω.profile ((E.instantiate n).subst σ))
      (Ω.profile (Expr.pi D E |>.subst σ)) := by
  have hp' := ContextTower.HasType.subst hp hσ
  have hn' := ContextTower.HasType.subst hn hσ
  obtain ⟨J,htr,hpath⟩ := Ω.frame_profiles hw hp' hn'
  rw [← Expr.instantiate_subst]
  exact hpath.trans (.single (.codomain htr))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Congruence/Variant73da2dd16c3bd45dce0060ec2c6a3434e749ee383f31e7610fe914004ae86394.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Congruence/Variant73da2dd16c3bd45dce0060ec2c6a3434e749ee383f31e7610fe914004ae86394.lean#L1127).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `96d3ffeb86b9dc10530fed949ca0490756771eb6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
