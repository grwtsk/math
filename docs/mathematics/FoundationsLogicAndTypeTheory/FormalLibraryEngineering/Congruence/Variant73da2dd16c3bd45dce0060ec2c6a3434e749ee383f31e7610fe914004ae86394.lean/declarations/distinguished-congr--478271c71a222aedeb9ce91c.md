## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1c37b57a-ac84-df82-1dc7-622ac205f699`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 70–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem distinguished_congr {T U : ActiveType Ω C} (hTU : T.type = U.type) :
    (distinguished (hw := hw) Ω C hno T).val = (distinguished Ω C hno U).val := by
  have hu := ActiveType.ext hTU
  subst U
  rfl

namespace PreResult

section
variable {Ω C hno} {Γ Δ : List (Expr S)} {M M' T T' : Expr S}
variable {e : Environment (hw := hw) Ω C hno Γ} {f : Environment (hw := hw) Ω C hno Δ}

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Congruence/Variant73da2dd16c3bd45dce0060ec2c6a3434e749ee383f31e7610fe914004ae86394.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Congruence/Variant73da2dd16c3bd45dce0060ec2c6a3434e749ee383f31e7610fe914004ae86394.lean#L70).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `96d3ffeb86b9dc10530fed949ca0490756771eb6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
