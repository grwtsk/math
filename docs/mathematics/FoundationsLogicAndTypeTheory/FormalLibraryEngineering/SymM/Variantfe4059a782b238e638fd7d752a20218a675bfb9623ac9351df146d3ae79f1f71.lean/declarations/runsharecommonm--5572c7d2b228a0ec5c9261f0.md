## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0b9ef19f4d6eb2496979c94a206d71ce9005e404c36b88a137c4f760faee9ddc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 342–353.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def runShareCommonM (k : AlphaShareCommonM α) (ctx : AlphaShareCommon.Context) : SymM (Except AlphaShareCommon.Cache α) := do
  let share ← modifyGet fun s => (s.share, { s with share := {} })
  match k ctx share with
  | .ok a share => modify fun s => { s with share }; return .ok a
  | .error cache share => modify fun s => { s with share }; return .error cache

/--
Runs `x` with the `shareCommon` kernel-projection check disabled.
Use this to wrap code that temporarily violates the `SymM` folded-projections
invariant, e.g., a head reducer that exposes kernel projections in intermediate
terms and restores the invariant in its final result.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SymM/Variantfe4059a782b238e638fd7d752a20218a675bfb9623ac9351df146d3ae79f1f71.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SymM/Variantfe4059a782b238e638fd7d752a20218a675bfb9623ac9351df146d3ae79f1f71.lean#L342).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fbc26446cc9617edfc7915675ce36a1d6c468b30` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
