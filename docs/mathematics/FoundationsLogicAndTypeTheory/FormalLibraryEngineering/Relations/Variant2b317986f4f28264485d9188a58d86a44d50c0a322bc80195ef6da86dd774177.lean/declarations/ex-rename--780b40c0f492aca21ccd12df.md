## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7692d8fc-9ba0-2807-f037-89a2f157fcb3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 741–744.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ex_rename (K : QuantifierCode S) (T Q : Expr S) (ρ : Nat → Nat) :
    (L.ex K T Q).rename ρ = (L.rename ρ).ex (K.rename ρ) (T.rename ρ) (Q.rename (Expr.liftRen
      ρ)) := by
  simp only [ex,neg_rename,QuantifierCode.all_rename,negBody_rename]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Relations/Variant2b317986f4f28264485d9188a58d86a44d50c0a322bc80195ef6da86dd774177.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Relations/Variant2b317986f4f28264485d9188a58d86a44d50c0a322bc80195ef6da86dd774177.lean#L741).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1f90b406fb5525fc45bcf4ca4ca28e4844bc4b81` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
