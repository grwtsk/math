## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b26b839a7003ebc15d720e3c95627d1b3298aa3cab4ef98d8f347cd56920f862`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–175.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public instance [LE α] [Min α] [Std.LawfulOrderLeftLeaningMin α] [IsLinearOrder α] : Commutative (min : α → α → α) where
  comm a b := by apply le_antisymm <;> simp [min_le_min]

end Std

namespace Classical.Order
open Std

/--
Derives an `Ord α` instance from an `LE α` instance. Because all elements are comparable with
`compare`, the resulting `Ord α` instance only makes sense if `LE α` is total.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LemmasExtra/Variant91fbd3c715a489af06f4624e8378f7503ef9aed1cbdf494b0cc10f7ad9b4cc8e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LemmasExtra/Variant91fbd3c715a489af06f4624e8378f7503ef9aed1cbdf494b0cc10f7ad9b4cc8e.lean#L164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `58e57bc20ad0391d0c2d31836aae291d05cce94b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
