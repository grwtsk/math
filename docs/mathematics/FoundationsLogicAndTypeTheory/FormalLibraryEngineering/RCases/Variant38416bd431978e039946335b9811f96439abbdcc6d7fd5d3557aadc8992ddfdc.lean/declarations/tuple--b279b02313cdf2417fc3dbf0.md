## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6f4fe94ac7b1126e7fd7121059078960f40ffd75e1f26f33c10e3ea334dbf6e8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 169–180.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def tuple₁ : List/-Π-/ RCasesPatt → RCasesPatt
  | []      => default
  | [one ref n] => one ref n
  | ps      => tuple ps.head!.ref $ tuple₁Core ps

/--
This function is used for producing rcases patterns based on a case tree. Here we are given
the list of patterns to apply to each argument of each constructor after the main case, and must
produce a list of alternatives with the same effect. This function calls `tuple₁` to make the
individual alternatives, and handles merging `[a, b, c | d]` to `a | b | c | d` instead of
`a | b | (c | d)`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RCases/Variant38416bd431978e039946335b9811f96439abbdcc6d7fd5d3557aadc8992ddfdc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RCases/Variant38416bd431978e039946335b9811f96439abbdcc6d7fd5d3557aadc8992ddfdc.lean#L169).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `12e86ccedbef509addf70d63a92bd5a1c1de1256` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
