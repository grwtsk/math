## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `syntax` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bcb212bdddae43a1e731f2f0f24d50304463e2e57020d8d1828f476516a272b9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–152.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

`rcases? e` will perform case splits on `e` in the same way as `rcases e`,
but rather than accepting a pattern, it does a maximal cases and prints the
pattern that would produce this case splitting. The default maximum depth is 5,
but this can be modified with `rcases? e : n`.

/--
`rcases` is a tactic that will perform `cases` recursively, according to a pattern. It is used to
destructure hypotheses or expressions composed of inductive types like `h1 : a ∧ b ∧ c ∨ d` or
`h2 : ∃ x y, trans_rel R x y`. Usual usage might be `rcases h1 with ⟨ha, hb, hc⟩ | hd` or
`rcases h2 with ⟨x, y, _ | ⟨z, hxz, hzy⟩⟩` for these examples.

Each element of an `rcases` pattern is matched against a particular local hypothesis (most of which
are generated during the execution of `rcases` and represent individual elements destructured from
the input expression). An `rcases` pattern has the following grammar:

* A name like `x`, which names the active hypothesis as `x`.
* A blank `_`, which does nothing (letting the automatic naming system used by `cases` name the
  hypothesis).
* A hyphen `-`, which clears the active hypothesis and any dependents.
* The keyword `rfl`, which expects the hypothesis to be `h : a = b`, and calls `subst` on the
  hypothesis (which has the effect of replacing `b` with `a` everywhere or vice versa).
* A type ascription `p : ty`, which sets the type of the hypothesis to `ty` and then matches it
  against `p`. (Of course, `ty` must unify with the actual type of `h` for this to work.)
* A tuple pattern `⟨p1, p2, p3⟩`, which matches a constructor with many arguments, or a series
  of nested conjunctions or existentials. For example if the active hypothesis is `a ∧ b ∧ c`,
  then the conjunction will be destructured, and `p1` will be matched against `a`, `p2` against `b`
  and so on.
* A `@` before a tuple pattern as in `@⟨p1, p2, p3⟩` will bind all arguments in the constructor,
  while leaving the `@` off will only use the patterns on the explicit arguments.
* An alternation pattern `p1 | p2 | p3`, which matches an inductive type with multiple constructors,
  or a nested disjunction like `a ∨ b ∨ c`.

A pattern like `⟨a, b, c⟩ | ⟨d, e⟩` will do a split over the inductive datatype,
naming the first three parameters of the first constructor as `a,b,c` and the
first two of the second constructor `d,e`. If the list is not as long as the
number of arguments to the constructor or the number of constructors, the
remaining variables will be automatically named. If there are nested brackets
such as `⟨⟨a⟩, b | c⟩ | d` then these will cause more case splits as necessary.
If there are too many arguments, such as `⟨a, b, c⟩` for splitting on
`∃ x, ∃ y, p x`, then it will be treated as `⟨a, ⟨b, c⟩⟩`, splitting the last
parameter as necessary.

`rcases` also has special support for quotient types: quotient induction into Prop works like
matching on the constructor `quot.mk`.

`rcases h : e with PAT` will do the same as `rcases e with PAT` with the exception that an
assumption `h : e = PAT` will be added to the context.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RCases/Varianta5c5694178d7a376baa6f8ccda1e946a7dc1b048d06be083b7afc6d3f255e675.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RCases/Varianta5c5694178d7a376baa6f8ccda1e946a7dc1b048d06be083b7afc6d3f255e675.lean#L97).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `acdc07e7dcfc9f8276c183dbfbc836ef4d69cf63` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
