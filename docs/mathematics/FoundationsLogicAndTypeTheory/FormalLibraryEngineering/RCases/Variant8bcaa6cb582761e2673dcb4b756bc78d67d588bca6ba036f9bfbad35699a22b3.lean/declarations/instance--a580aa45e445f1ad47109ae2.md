## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:51deb14fcc8c389ebaf89031629be4b6e25b514b4b5771d7c0b198ccddc31b4e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 34–63.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public instance : Coe (TSyntax `rcasesPat) (TSyntax `rintroPat) where
  coe stx := Unhygienic.run `(rintroPat| $stx:rcasesPat)

-- These frequently cause bootstrapping issues. Commented out for now, using `List/-Σ-/` and `List/-Π-/` instead.
-- /-- A list, with a disjunctive meaning (like a list of inductive constructors, or subgoals) -/
-- local notation "ListΣ" => List

-- /-- A list, with a conjunctive meaning (like a list of constructor arguments, or hypotheses) -/
-- local notation "ListΠ" => List

/--
An `rcases` pattern can be one of the following, in a nested combination:

* A name like `foo`
* The special keyword `rfl` (for pattern matching on equality using `subst`)
* A hyphen `-`, which clears the active hypothesis and any dependents.
* A type ascription like `pat : ty` (parentheses are optional)
* A tuple constructor like `⟨p1, p2, p3⟩`
* An alternation / variant pattern `p1 | p2 | p3`

Parentheses can be used for grouping; alternation is higher precedence than type ascription, so
`p1 | p2 | p3 : ty` means `(p1 | p2 | p3) : ty`.

N-ary alternations are treated as a group, so `p1 | p2 | p3` is not the same as `p1 | (p2 | p3)`,
and similarly for tuples. However, note that an n-ary alternation or tuple can match an n-ary
conjunction or disjunction, because if the number of patterns exceeds the number of constructors in
the type being destructed, the extra patterns will match on the last element, meaning that
`p1 | p2 | p3` will act like `p1 | (p2 | p3)` when matching `a1 ∨ a2 ∨ a3`. If matching against a
type with 3 constructors,  `p1 | (p2 | p3)` will act like `p1 | (p2 | p3) | _` instead.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RCases/Variant8bcaa6cb582761e2673dcb4b756bc78d67d588bca6ba036f9bfbad35699a22b3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RCases/Variant8bcaa6cb582761e2673dcb4b756bc78d67d588bca6ba036f9bfbad35699a22b3.lean#L34).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e1fda580b9107b66e104e2eb0f3316eb249d48c1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
