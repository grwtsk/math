## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:07dc479d9d1313ff3135f16b850f20b9c4c1c8582357dfd5be76f4cf6663adbb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 520–537.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def generalizeExceptFVar (goal : MVarId) (args : Array GeneralizeArg) :
    MetaM (Array Expr × MVarId) := do
  let argsToGeneralize := args.filter fun arg => !(arg.expr.isFVar && arg.hName?.isNone)
  let (fvarIdsNew, goal) ← goal.generalize argsToGeneralize
  let mut result := #[]
  let mut j := 0
  for arg in args do
    if arg.expr.isFVar && arg.hName?.isNone then
      result := result.push arg.expr
    else
      result := result.push (mkFVar fvarIdsNew[j]!)
      j := j+1
  pure (result, goal)

/--
Given a list of targets of the form `e` or `h : e`, and a pattern, match all the targets
against the pattern. Returns the list of produced subgoals.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RCases/Variant7aced9eec6fbfad41d5b8469e598701c9b232593963b4e85252cbde3d02b7c80.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RCases/Variant7aced9eec6fbfad41d5b8469e598701c9b232593963b4e85252cbde3d02b7c80.lean#L520).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77ea0577850a57144aa89b9217bf41e1eed024a0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
