## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:15d9db049f052d1323c0dbbbb16e1df1315e23c4f97856b8523fd833cd008686`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 21–27.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure CancellableTask where
  task : Task (Except RequestError (LazyEncodable Json))
  /- Note: we cannot just `IO.cancel task` because it is a result of `map`.
  See https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Should.20cancelling.20a.20purely.20mapped.20task.20cancel.20the.20original.3F -/
  cancel : IO Unit

/-- Maps the ID of each currently executing request to its task. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Cancellable/Variantc5403e8b2bc1fe9803d9046dedd5271ce305e1bbf14bea521aeea77eb08d4b07.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Cancellable/Variantc5403e8b2bc1fe9803d9046dedd5271ce305e1bbf14bea521aeea77eb08d4b07.lean#L21).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8520668dd2079be2e5e490b183c50601787fea3e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
