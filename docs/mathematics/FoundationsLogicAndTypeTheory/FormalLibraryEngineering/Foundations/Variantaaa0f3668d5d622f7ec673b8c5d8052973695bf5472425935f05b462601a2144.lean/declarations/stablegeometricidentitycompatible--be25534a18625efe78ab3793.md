## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b65ce2cea62a4d8fa5643ecbd82a4ebe2f6cda9362b3e8421e32ed705c5411a7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 30–48.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure StableGeometricIdentityCompatible
    {Stage : Type uStage}
    (refines : Stage → Stage → Prop)
    (I : StableGeometricIdentityData Stage) : Prop where
  identityStable :
    ∀ {next prev}, refines next prev →
      I.witnessAt next = I.witnessAt prev
  versionCompatible :
    ∀ {next prev}, refines next prev →
      I.versionRefines (I.versionAt next) (I.versionAt prev)
  validityCompatible :
    ∀ {next prev}, refines next prev →
      I.validityRefines (I.validityAt next) (I.validityAt prev)

/--
A modular provenance-bearing source signature.  Except for entity identity and
the numerical traversal weight, fields are relations so entities need not have
exactly one incidence, factorization, coordinate, version, or provenance ref.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Foundations/Variantaaa0f3668d5d622f7ec673b8c5d8052973695bf5472425935f05b462601a2144.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Foundations/Variantaaa0f3668d5d622f7ec673b8c5d8052973695bf5472425935f05b462601a2144.lean#L30).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9a380abec229abc7fb5c497f33a24dd194b99d09` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
