## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1582e8aa43fd12bf3a1d388ecd5565ecf255c6744ad592f7572475b3103d1f38`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 99–111.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure AState where
  /-- The prop/proof triples to add to the local context.
  The proofs must not refer to fvars in `fvars`. -/
  generalizations : Array (Expr × Expr) := #[]
  /-- Map version of `generalizations`. Use `MAbs.findProof?` and `MAbs.insertProof`. -/
  propToProof : ExprMap Expr := {}

/--
Monad used to abstract proofs, to prepare for generalization.
Has a cache (of expr/type? pairs),
and it also has a reader context `Mathlib/Tactic/GeneralizeProofs/AContext.lean`
and a state `Mathlib/Tactic/GeneralizeProofs/AState.lean`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/GeneralizeProofs/Variant876f6d16eca7a322e80d05272358d3ad935f809be3e78c47c49d15c0c66d317c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/GeneralizeProofs/Variant876f6d16eca7a322e80d05272358d3ad935f809be3e78c47c49d15c0c66d317c.lean#L99).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c730ebe2c90cb2baa004a1490c471fdf4edf303f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
