## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e622956b784909c7848d2b30f3b2d06795a7d8cb8eeb66b83c49366cd0e9851f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 126–141.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def MAbs.insertProof (prop pf : Expr) : MAbs Unit := do
  if (← read).config.debug then
    unless ← isDefEq prop (← inferType pf) do
      throwError "insertProof: proof{indentD pf}does not have type{indentD prop}"
    unless ← Lean.MetavarContext.isWellFormed (← read).initLCtx pf do
      throwError "insertProof: proof{indentD pf}\nis not well-formed in the initial context\n\
        fvars: {(← read).fvars}"
    unless ← Lean.MetavarContext.isWellFormed (← read).initLCtx prop do
      throwError "insertProof: proof{indentD prop}\nis not well-formed in the initial context\n\
        fvars: {(← read).fvars}"
  modify fun s =>
    { s with
      generalizations := s.generalizations.push (prop, pf)
      propToProof := s.propToProof.insert prop pf }

/-- Runs `x` with an additional local variable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/GeneralizeProofs/Variant8220df6267b73aa1fa3221ae4aa481bf79a68b5251b160639dadc7d5f647da91.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/GeneralizeProofs/Variant8220df6267b73aa1fa3221ae4aa481bf79a68b5251b160639dadc7d5f647da91.lean#L126).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6d13bfa7a36083eb7d8578b038e9db071990e897` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
