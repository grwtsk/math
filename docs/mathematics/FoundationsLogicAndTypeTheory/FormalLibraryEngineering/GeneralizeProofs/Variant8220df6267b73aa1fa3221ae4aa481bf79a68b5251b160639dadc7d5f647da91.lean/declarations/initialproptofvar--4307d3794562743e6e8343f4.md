## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a49f1a60104e1ed48a948fb7c28af33e7b4c7d7c3cc6f42d46b842d7512d16c8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 331–349.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def initialPropToFVar : MetaM (ExprMap Expr) := do
  -- Visit decls in reverse order so that in case there are duplicates,
  -- earlier proofs are preferred
  (← getLCtx).foldrM (init := {}) fun decl m => do
    if !decl.isImplementationDetail then
      let ty := (← instantiateMVars decl.type).cleanupAnnotations
      if ← Meta.isProp ty then
        return m.insert ty decl.toExpr
    return m

/--
Generalizes the proofs in the type `e` and runs `k` in a local context with these propositions.
This continuation `k` is passed
1. an array of fvars for the propositions
2. an array of proof terms (extracted from `e`) that prove these propositions
3. the generalized `e`, which refers to these fvars

The `propToFVar` map is updated with the new proposition fvars.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/GeneralizeProofs/Variant8220df6267b73aa1fa3221ae4aa481bf79a68b5251b160639dadc7d5f647da91.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/GeneralizeProofs/Variant8220df6267b73aa1fa3221ae4aa481bf79a68b5251b160639dadc7d5f647da91.lean#L331).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6d13bfa7a36083eb7d8578b038e9db071990e897` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
