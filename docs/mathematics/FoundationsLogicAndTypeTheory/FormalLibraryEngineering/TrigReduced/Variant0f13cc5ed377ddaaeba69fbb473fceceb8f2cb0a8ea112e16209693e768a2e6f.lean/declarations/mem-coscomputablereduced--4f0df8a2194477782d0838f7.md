## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0c230824-f7bf-ef7c-7209-707f1a361764`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 296–317.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_cosComputableReduced {x : ℝ} {I : IntervalRat} (hx : x ∈ I) (n : ℕ := 10) :
    Real.cos x ∈ cosComputableReduced I n := by
  unfold cosComputableReduced reduceToMainPeriod
  simp only []
  set Ired := shiftInterval I (computeShiftK I) with hIred
  set k := computeShiftK I with hk
  have hxred : x - 2 * Real.pi * k ∈ Ired := by
    rw [hIred, hk]
    exact mem_shiftInterval_of_mem hx
  have hcos_eq : Real.cos x = Real.cos (x - 2 * Real.pi * k) := by
    have h := Real.cos_add_int_mul_two_pi x (-k)
    simp only [Int.cast_neg, neg_mul] at h
    rw [← h]
    ring_nf
  split_ifs with hwide
  · simp only [IntervalRat.mem_def, Rat.cast_neg, Rat.cast_one]
    exact ⟨Real.neg_one_le_cos x, Real.cos_le_one x⟩
  · push Not at hwide
    rw [hcos_eq]
    exact IntervalRat.mem_cosComputable hxred n

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TrigReduced/Variant0f13cc5ed377ddaaeba69fbb473fceceb8f2cb0a8ea112e16209693e768a2e6f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TrigReduced/Variant0f13cc5ed377ddaaeba69fbb473fceceb8f2cb0a8ea112e16209693e768a2e6f.lean#L296).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8236def4d1dc8de6064b30caac3bf5a91b01f21c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
