## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6f4fd0817905e4a8ea2e421d368a81b5424099905d699ecded912afd7e0a6cfc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure DeclCache (α : Type) where mk' ::
  /-- The cached data. -/
  cache : Cache α
  /-- Function for adding a declaration from the current file to the cache. -/
  addDecl : Name → ConstantInfo → α → MetaM α
  /-- Function for adding a declaration from the library to the cache.
  Defaults to the same behaviour as adding a declaration from the current file. -/
  addLibraryDecl : Name → ConstantInfo → α → MetaM α := addDecl
  deriving Nonempty

/--
Creates a `DeclCache`.
The cached structure `α` is initialized with `empty`,
and then `addLibraryDecl` is called for every imported constant, and the result is cached.
After all imported constants have been added, we run `post`.
When `get` is called, `addDecl` is also called for every constant in the current file.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Cache/Variant9f5c6b7a35361a78ebe8ee77cd8997197d6203db6d7643cb9068224a4105d6f0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Cache/Variant9f5c6b7a35361a78ebe8ee77cd8997197d6203db6d7643cb9068224a4105d6f0.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `54bb2f100303fb134c5777ff9711e5a567260f76` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
