## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:87d6ef4ae12cc87753f4cf2986b1dbaf0c155fa20a181cd33fdd98fdb24765e9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 186–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def DiscrTreeCache.getMatch (c : DiscrTreeCache α) (e : Expr) : MetaM (Array α) := do
  let (locals, imports) ← c.get
  -- `DiscrTree.getMatch` returns results in batches, with more specific lemmas coming later.
  -- Hence we reverse this list, so we try out more specific lemmas earlier.
  return (← locals.getMatch e).reverse ++ (← imports.getMatch e).reverse

/--
A structure that holds the cached discrimination tree,
and possibly a pointer to a memory region, if we unpickled the tree from disk.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Cache/Variant6e9656e4ace263eb8e8fc26f0abb502cd4ed77fbcbcea7959780ded0a6f6eb74.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Cache/Variant6e9656e4ace263eb8e8fc26f0abb502cd4ed77fbcbcea7959780ded0a6f6eb74.lean#L186).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `080375618a05f3a383ef69942703abc3cb259bc0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
