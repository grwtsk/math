## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:81cf5654cb935c14bb89744b98d048cb44271a6cf1b2b1722063097725bd5ef1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 30–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def elabSymSimproc (stx : Syntax) : GrindTacticM Simproc := do
  let elabFns := symSimprocElabAttribute.getEntries (← getEnv) stx.getKind
  for elabFn in elabFns do
    try
      return (← elabFn.value stx)
    catch ex =>
      match ex with
      | .internal id _ =>
        if id == unsupportedSyntaxExceptionId then continue
        else throw ex
      | _ => throw ex
  throwErrorAt stx "unsupported sym_simproc syntax `{stx.getKind}`"

/-- Elaborate a `sym_discharger` syntax node into a `Discharger`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimprocDSL/Variantbb4e492557c89db4194e2fc694213cde90d55b7d4cd4355ca627f58d621028f0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimprocDSL/Variantbb4e492557c89db4194e2fc694213cde90d55b7d4cd4355ca627f58d621028f0.lean#L30).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6a6b27e6d9b48bd7c267e8c5a42b970a49bc746a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
