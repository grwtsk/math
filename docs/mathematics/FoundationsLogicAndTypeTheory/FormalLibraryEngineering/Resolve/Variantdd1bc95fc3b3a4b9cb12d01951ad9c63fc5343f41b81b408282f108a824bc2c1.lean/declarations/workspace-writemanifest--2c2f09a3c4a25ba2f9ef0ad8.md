## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5c3d3ff5b1010700cdf55a1182829f6e7167a618edc570ad0deead802bdd0c92`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 503–520.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Workspace.writeManifest
  (ws : Workspace) (entries : NameMap PackageEntry)
: IO PUnit := do
  let manifestEntries := ws.packages.foldl (init := #[]) fun arr pkg =>
    match entries.find? pkg.baseName with
    | some entry => arr.push <|
      entry.setManifestFile pkg.relManifestFile |>.setConfigFile pkg.relConfigFile
    | none => arr -- should only be the case for the root
  let manifest : Manifest := {
    name := ws.root.baseName
    fixedToolchain := ws.root.fixedToolchain
    lakeDir := ws.relLakeDir
    packagesDir? := ws.relPkgsDir
    packages := manifestEntries
  }
  manifest.save ws.manifestFile

/-- Run a package's `post_update` hooks. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Resolve/Variantdd1bc95fc3b3a4b9cb12d01951ad9c63fc5343f41b81b408282f108a824bc2c1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Resolve/Variantdd1bc95fc3b3a4b9cb12d01951ad9c63fc5343f41b81b408282f108a824bc2c1.lean#L503).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `12bc63da52e494f596009abb873fad86cfda7530` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
