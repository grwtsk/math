## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2b936ab088b1ad85153372b9155bb618aaacf29dc91b37fd5111b8711b2e926d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 35–44.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkRecAppWithSyntax (e : Expr) (stx : Syntax) : Expr :=
  let m := KVMap.empty.insert recAppKey (.ofSyntax stx)
  let m := match stx.getPos? with
    | some p => m.insert recAppPosKey (.ofNat p.byteIdx)
    | none   => m
  mkMData m e

Retrieve (if available) the syntax object attached to a recursive application.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RecAppSyntax/Variant97b87b0c839138c1b9ac929d136b55de614b2da1d74d8f6b402228baaa19bdc1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RecAppSyntax/Variant97b87b0c839138c1b9ac929d136b55de614b2da1d74d8f6b402228baaa19bdc1.lean#L35).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3e49cb4df0ecf1aceacfcd91093bc431eb466750` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
