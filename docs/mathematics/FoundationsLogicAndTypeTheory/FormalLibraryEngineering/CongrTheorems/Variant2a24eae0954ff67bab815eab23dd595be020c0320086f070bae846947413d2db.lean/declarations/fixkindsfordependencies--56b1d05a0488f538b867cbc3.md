## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dd06193a23552c644d4f6a2ba4677fde374a7acfadf40bc15813ef987f73f495`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 126–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def fixKindsForDependencies (info : FunInfo) (kinds : Array CongrArgKind) : Array CongrArgKind := Id.run do
  let mut kinds := kinds
  for i in *...info.paramInfo.size do
    for hj : j in (i+1)...info.paramInfo.size do
      if info.paramInfo[j].backDeps.contains i then
        if kinds[j]! matches .eq | .fixed then
          -- We must fix `i` because there is a `j` that depends on `i` and `j` is not cast-fixed.
          kinds := kinds.set! i .fixed
          break
  return kinds

/-- Returns `true` if `kinds` contains `.cast` or `.subsingletonInst` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CongrTheorems/Variant2a24eae0954ff67bab815eab23dd595be020c0320086f070bae846947413d2db.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CongrTheorems/Variant2a24eae0954ff67bab815eab23dd595be020c0320086f070bae846947413d2db.lean#L126).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2b0f7de86c99ab7a804854faf9d97370d0007f8c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
