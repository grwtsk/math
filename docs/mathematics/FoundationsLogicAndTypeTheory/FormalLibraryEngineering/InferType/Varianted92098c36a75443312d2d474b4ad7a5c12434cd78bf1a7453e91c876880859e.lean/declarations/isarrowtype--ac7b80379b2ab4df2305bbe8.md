## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7e580a2c2a61a5f961afe7526163cc82f622a80f2527ac3116796a840b440fdb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 459–470.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private partial def isArrowType : Expr → Nat → MetaM LBool
  | .sort ..,         0   => return LBool.true
  | .forallE ..,      0   => return LBool.false
  | .forallE _ _ b _, n+1 => isArrowType b n
  | .letE _ _ _ b _,  n   => isArrowType b n
  | .mdata _ e,       n   => isArrowType e n
  | _,                _   => return LBool.undef

/--
`isTypeQuickApp f n` is an "approximate" predicate which returns `LBool.true` if `f` applied to
`n` arguments is a type.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/InferType/Varianted92098c36a75443312d2d474b4ad7a5c12434cd78bf1a7453e91c876880859e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/InferType/Varianted92098c36a75443312d2d474b4ad7a5c12434cd78bf1a7453e91c876880859e.lean#L459).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0e3d57afdffbb1d4d62bb423b8847afa4216af13` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
