## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d14b0713ec12d0170fb5cf3dea0f71d7e4928c9afe89c6cf889a543829797fca`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 28–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def instantiateMVarsInType [Monad m] [MonadMCtx m] [MonadError m]
    (mvarId : MVarId) : m Expr := do
  let mdecl ← (← getMCtx).getExprMVarDecl mvarId
  let type := mdecl.type
  if type.hasMVar then
    let type ← instantiateMVars type
    let mdecl := { mdecl with type }
    modifyMCtx (·.declareExprMVar mvarId mdecl)
    return type
  else
    return type

/--
Instantiate metavariables in the `LocalDecl` of the given fvar, update the
`LocalDecl` and return the new `LocalDecl.`

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/InstantiateMVars/Variant8f2e5924beebb3ae7ebc020d1df55acb3888189f7afb0a08a0fb808b94ea445e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/InstantiateMVars/Variant8f2e5924beebb3ae7ebc020d1df55acb3888189f7afb0a08a0fb808b94ea445e.lean#L28).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4cebd1cad90c1ce6c56c3b598b550c73110fdb27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
