## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5c1175d992d66219a09047d833b2909be4e163f72a3149b4fe0248649506113c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 126–143.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[command_elab exportPrivate] def elabExportPrivate : CommandElab
| `(export private $ids* $[in $tgts*]? $[from $mods*]?) =>
  elabOpenPrivateLike ids tgts mods fun c name _ => liftCoreM do
    let cinfo ← getConstInfo c
    if (← getEnv).contains name then
      throwError s!"'{name}' has already been declared"
    let decl := Declaration.defnDecl {
      name := name,
      levelParams := cinfo.levelParams,
      type := cinfo.type,
      value := mkConst c (cinfo.levelParams.map mkLevelParam),
      hints := ReducibilityHints.abbrev,
      safety := if cinfo.isUnsafe then DefinitionSafety.unsafe else DefinitionSafety.safe
    }
    addDecl decl
    compileDecl decl
    pure name
| _ => throwUnsupportedSyntax
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/OpenPrivate/Varianteb1bc6cb3b08f5aa8e534584c4ed0bcbc779f112b24b8c0b80cf3fddec2390b5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/OpenPrivate/Varianteb1bc6cb3b08f5aa8e534584c4ed0bcbc779f112b24b8c0b80cf3fddec2390b5.lean#L126).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0d3686a2641c201cd81f259347da873baff47464` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
