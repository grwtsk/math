## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:01151532e63d51fbb1e74b16bc5982d29dfe8baa826f3a6f6bc6a7e95c4873a5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 287–306.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def withExtN [Monad m] [MonadLiftT TermElabM m] [MonadExcept Exception m]
    (g : MVarId) (pats : List (TSyntax `rcasesPat)) (k : MVarId → List (TSyntax `rcasesPat) → m Nat)
    (depth := 100) (failIfUnchanged := true) : m Nat :=
  match depth with
  | 0 => k g pats
  | depth+1 => do
    if failIfUnchanged then
      withExt1 g pats fun g pats => withExtN g pats k depth (failIfUnchanged := false)
    else try
      withExt1 g pats fun g pats => withExtN g pats k depth (failIfUnchanged := false)
    catch _ => k g pats

/--
Apply extensionality theorems as much as possible, using `pats` to introduce the variables
in extensionality theorems like `funext`. Returns a list of subgoals.

This is built on top of `withExtN`, running in `TermElabM` to build the list of new subgoals.
(And, for each goal, the patterns consumed.)

-- This is public as it is used in the implementation of `rcongr` in Batteries.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Ext/Variantc86bf1ea30059a803bd02e62320fe13af43b43d0c0540bb545b5460ad527948a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Ext/Variantc86bf1ea30059a803bd02e62320fe13af43b43d0c0540bb545b5460ad527948a.lean#L287).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9696f8a49876b9f79f9b348db541de0167786ccf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
