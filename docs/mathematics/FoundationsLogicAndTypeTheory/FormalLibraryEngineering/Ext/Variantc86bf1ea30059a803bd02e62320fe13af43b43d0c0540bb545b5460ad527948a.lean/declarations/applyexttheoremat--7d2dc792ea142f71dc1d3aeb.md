## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:effecbc37bb285775e174cb017e7035d1da1f44339477befa04126273fee1271`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 228–252.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public def applyExtTheoremAt (goal : MVarId) : MetaM (List MVarId) := goal.withContext do
  let tgt ← goal.getType'
  unless tgt.isAppOfArity ``Eq 3 do
    throwError "This extensionality tactic only applies to equalities, not{indentExpr tgt}"
  let ty := tgt.getArg! 0
  let s ← saveState
  for lem in ← getExtTheorems ty do
    try
      -- Note: We have to do this extra check to ensure that we don't apply e.g.
      -- funext to a goal `(?a₁ : ?b) = ?a₂` to produce `(?a₁ x : ?b') = ?a₂ x`,
      -- since this will loop.
      -- We require that the type of the equality is not changed by the `goal.apply c` line
      -- TODO: add flag to apply tactic to toggle unification vs. matching
      withNewMCtxDepth do
        let c ← mkConstWithFreshMVarLevels lem.declName
        let (_, _, declTy) ← withDefault <| forallMetaTelescopeReducing (← inferType c)
        guard (← isDefEq tgt declTy)
      -- We use `newGoals := .all` as this is
      -- more useful in practice with dependently typed arguments of `@[ext]` theorems.
      return ← goal.apply (cfg := { newGoals := .all }) (← mkConstWithFreshMVarLevels lem.declName)
    catch _ => s.restore
  throwError m!"No applicable extensionality theorem found for type{indentExpr ty}"
    ++ .note m!"Extensionality theorems can be registered by marking them with the `[ext]` attribute"

/-- Apply a single extensionality theorem to the current goal. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Ext/Variantc86bf1ea30059a803bd02e62320fe13af43b43d0c0540bb545b5460ad527948a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Ext/Variantc86bf1ea30059a803bd02e62320fe13af43b43d0c0540bb545b5460ad527948a.lean#L228).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9696f8a49876b9f79f9b348db541de0167786ccf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
