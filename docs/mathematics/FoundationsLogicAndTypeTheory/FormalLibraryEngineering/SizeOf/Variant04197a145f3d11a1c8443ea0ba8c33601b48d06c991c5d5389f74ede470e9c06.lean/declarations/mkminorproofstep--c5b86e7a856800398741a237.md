## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cc402d5597541889d4614537385862576656b9179de5c1c16d76e0703e685de4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 264–276.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
  private partial def mkMinorProofStep (ys : Array Expr) (lhs rhs : Expr) : M Expr := do
    if (← isDefEq lhs rhs) then
      mkEqRefl rhs
    else
      let lhs ← recToSizeOf lhs
      trace[Meta.sizeOf.minor.step] "{lhs} =?= {rhs}"
      let target ← mkEq lhs rhs
      for y in ys do
        if (← isDefEq (← inferType y) target) then
          return y
      mkSizeOfAuxLemma lhs rhs

  /-- Construct proof of auxiliary lemma. See `mkSizeOfAuxLemma` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SizeOf/Variant04197a145f3d11a1c8443ea0ba8c33601b48d06c991c5d5389f74ede470e9c06.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SizeOf/Variant04197a145f3d11a1c8443ea0ba8c33601b48d06c991c5d5389f74ede470e9c06.lean#L264).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `983fb719306e794879b87770a5ea6ec52b5a212d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
