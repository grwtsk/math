## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:704c66485e64ea8fda79c6a2126c031892e4d904a58ab29c82ca839bb70e771c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 158–189.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
def pushNegLocalDecl (fvarId : FVarId) : TacticM Unit := withMainContext do
  let ldecl ← fvarId.getDecl
  if ldecl.isAuxDecl then return
  let tgt ← instantiateMVars ldecl.type
  let goal ← getMainGoal
  let myres ← pushNegCore tgt
  let some (_, newGoal) ← applySimpResultToLocalDecl goal fvarId myres False | failure
  replaceMainGoal [newGoal]

/--
Push negations into the conclusion of a hypothesis.
For instance, a hypothesis `h : ¬ ∀ x, ∃ y, x ≤ y` will be transformed by `push_neg at h` into
`h : ∃ x, ∀ y, y < x`. Variable names are conserved.
This tactic pushes negations inside expressions. For instance, given a hypothesis
```lean
h : ¬ ∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ → |f x - y₀| ≤ ε)
```
writing `push_neg at h` will turn `h` into
```lean
h : ∃ ε, ε > 0 ∧ ∀ δ, δ > 0 → (∃ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ ∧ ε < |f x - y₀|),
```
(The pretty printer does *not* use the abbreviations `∀ δ > 0` and `∃ ε > 0` but this issue
has nothing to do with `push_neg`).

Note that names are conserved by this tactic, contrary to what would happen with `simp`
using the relevant lemmas. One can also use this tactic at the goal using `push_neg`,
at every hypothesis and the goal using `push_neg at *` or at selected hypotheses and the goal
using say `push_neg at h h' ⊢` as usual.

This tactic has two modes: in standard mode, it transforms `¬(p ∧ q)` into `p → ¬q`, whereas in
distrib mode it produces `¬p ∨ ¬q`. To use distrib mode, use `set_option push_neg.use_distrib true`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PushNeg/Variant6f1d6ed40783c8b0eede3f3e031012e8c836fbbbce6b2bfc42c5a2e640ba9bd6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PushNeg/Variant6f1d6ed40783c8b0eede3f3e031012e8c836fbbbce6b2bfc42c5a2e640ba9bd6.lean#L158).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `78db3455cbb787de5fc172fb165d1d6cbe5f4bed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
