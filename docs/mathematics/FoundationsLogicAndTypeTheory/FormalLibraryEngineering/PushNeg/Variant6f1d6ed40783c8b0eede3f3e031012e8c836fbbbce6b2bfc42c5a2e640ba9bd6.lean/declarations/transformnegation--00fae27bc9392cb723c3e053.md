## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e3bb214c72eb594fe842232e7110ea4a7ef657b19b54b8db64fbcb702020b5c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–108.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def transformNegation (e : Expr) : SimpM Simp.Step := do
  let Simp.Step.visit r₁ ← transformNegationStep e | return Simp.Step.visit { expr := e }
  match r₁.proof? with
  | none => return Simp.Step.visit r₁
  | some _ => do
      let Simp.Step.visit r₂ ← transformNegation r₁.expr | return Simp.Step.visit r₁
      return Simp.Step.visit (← Simp.mkEqTrans r₁ r₂)

/-- Common entry point to `push_neg` as a conv. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PushNeg/Variant6f1d6ed40783c8b0eede3f3e031012e8c836fbbbce6b2bfc42c5a2e640ba9bd6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PushNeg/Variant6f1d6ed40783c8b0eede3f3e031012e8c836fbbbce6b2bfc42c5a2e640ba9bd6.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `78db3455cbb787de5fc172fb165d1d6cbe5f4bed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
