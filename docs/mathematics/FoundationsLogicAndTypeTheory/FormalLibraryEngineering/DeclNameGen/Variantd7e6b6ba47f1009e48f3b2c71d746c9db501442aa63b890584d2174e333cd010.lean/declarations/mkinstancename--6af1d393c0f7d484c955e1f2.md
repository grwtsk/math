## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c95858f6fcc09858dfba3ee6554ad786f36a3aed2ad6e8ed536d5069f752ef83`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 270–278.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkInstanceName (binders : Array Syntax) (type : Syntax) : CommandElabM Name := do
  let savedState ← get
  try
    -- Unfortunately we can't include any of the binders from `runTermElabM` since, without
    -- elaborating the body of the instance, we have no idea which of these binders are
    -- actually used.
    runTermElabM fun _ => NameGen.mkBaseNameWithSuffix' "inst" binders type
  finally
    set savedState
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DeclNameGen/Variantd7e6b6ba47f1009e48f3b2c71d746c9db501442aa63b890584d2174e333cd010.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DeclNameGen/Variantd7e6b6ba47f1009e48f3b2c71d746c9db501442aa63b890584d2174e333cd010.lean#L270).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `340fcf95d8c446b0e503c8b3253106c48fcb681d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
