## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7b7ae509926a590598dfbccb6ffbea243902deb6e464deef451139a379cdef93`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 455–471.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Mathlib.TacticAnalysis.tryAtEachStep
    (tac : Syntax → MVarId → CommandElabM (TSyntax `tactic)) : TacticAnalysis.Config :=
  tryAtEachStepCore tac

/-- Run a tactic (given as a string) at each proof step, with optional timing.

`label` is the human-readable name shown in output (e.g., "grind").
`tacticStr` is the tactic syntax as a string (e.g., "grind +suggestions").
Tactic sequences like "simp; grind" are also supported.

Reports elapsed time in milliseconds for each successful replacement
when `linter.tacticAnalysis.tryAtEachStep.showTiming` is true.
To limit tactic runtime, use `set_option maxHeartbeats N` in the build command.

When `linter.tacticAnalysis.tryAtEachStep.selfReplacements` is false, cases where
the suggested tactic matches the existing proof are suppressed.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Declarations/Variant75f73ad361368ca2bb492bb674ff102234e4d8eeb5c00fd293b990ff4114ed5b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Declarations/Variant75f73ad361368ca2bb492bb674ff102234e4d8eeb5c00fd293b990ff4114ed5b.lean#L455).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `713f0aa2648dfc66b1982bdd9e5d8897bf8dc93a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
