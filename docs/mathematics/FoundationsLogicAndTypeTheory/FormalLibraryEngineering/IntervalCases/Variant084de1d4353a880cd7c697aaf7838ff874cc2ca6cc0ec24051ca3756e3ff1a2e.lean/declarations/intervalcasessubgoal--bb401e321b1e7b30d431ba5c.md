## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5e157b527cb55f8feb6b9c8b1abf43a0318162a3eb0d61f814ffc07435e44f2b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 46–59.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure IntervalCasesSubgoal where
  /-- The target expression, a numeral in the input type -/
  rhs : Expr
  /-- The numeric value of the target expression -/
  value : Int
  /-- The new subgoal, of the form `⊢ x = rhs → tgt` -/
  goal : MVarId

/--
A `Bound` represents the result of analyzing a lower or upper bound expression.
If `e` is the scrutinee expression, then a lower bound expression like `3 < e`
is normalized to `¬e ≤ 3` and represented as `.lt 3`, and an upper bound expression
like `e ≤ 5` is represented as `.le 5`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/IntervalCases/Variant084de1d4353a880cd7c697aaf7838ff874cc2ca6cc0ec24051ca3756e3ff1a2e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/IntervalCases/Variant084de1d4353a880cd7c697aaf7838ff874cc2ca6cc0ec24051ca3756e3ff1a2e.lean#L46).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `010740ceebf31650bfd954c627bfdd4d12b5a583` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
