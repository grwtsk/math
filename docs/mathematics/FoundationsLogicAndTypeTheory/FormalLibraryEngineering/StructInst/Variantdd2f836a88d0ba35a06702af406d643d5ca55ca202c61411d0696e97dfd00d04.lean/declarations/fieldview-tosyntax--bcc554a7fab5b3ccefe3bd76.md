## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4fbe00f0523a113a0f49461683ad1e1ceaac364b998b2d38ef66ab36ebc0f058`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 351–359.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def FieldView.toSyntax : FieldView → TSyntax ``Parser.Term.structInstField
  | field =>
    let stx := field.ref
    let stx := stx.setArg 1 <| stx[1].setArg 2 <| stx[1][2].setArg 2 field.val
    match field.lhs with
    | first::rest => stx.setArg 0 <| mkNode ``Parser.Term.structInstLVal #[first.toSyntax true, mkNullNode <| rest.toArray.map (FieldLHS.toSyntax false) ]
    | _ => unreachable!

/-- Creates a view of a field left-hand side. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/StructInst/Variantdd2f836a88d0ba35a06702af406d643d5ca55ca202c61411d0696e97dfd00d04.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/StructInst/Variantdd2f836a88d0ba35a06702af406d643d5ca55ca202c61411d0696e97dfd00d04.lean#L351).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5493e3d025e608ffc68d856f0b5b683431f64b09` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
