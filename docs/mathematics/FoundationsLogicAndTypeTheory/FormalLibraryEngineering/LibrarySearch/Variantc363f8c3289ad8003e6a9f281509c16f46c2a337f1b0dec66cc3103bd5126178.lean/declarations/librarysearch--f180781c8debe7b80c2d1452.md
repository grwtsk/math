## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7322e633fa0f96d822ecd5d6a4bb79994b98cdcbe1a48184d49dfcafefb1f3da`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 411–423.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def librarySearch (goal : MVarId)
    (tactic : List MVarId → MetaM (List MVarId) :=
      fun g => solveByElim [] (maxDepth := 6) (exfalso := false) g)
    (allowFailure : MVarId → MetaM Bool := fun _ => pure true)
    (leavePercentHeartbeats : Nat := 10)
    (includeStar : Bool := true)
    (collectAll : Bool := false) :
    MetaM (Option (Array (List MVarId × MetavarContext))) := do
  librarySearch' goal tactic allowFailure leavePercentHeartbeats includeStar collectAll

end LibrarySearch

end Lean.Meta.LibrarySearch
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LibrarySearch/Variantc363f8c3289ad8003e6a9f281509c16f46c2a337f1b0dec66cc3103bd5126178.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LibrarySearch/Variantc363f8c3289ad8003e6a9f281509c16f46c2a337f1b0dec66cc3103bd5126178.lean#L411).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2296198ad773bb12be7a314a97f67b1dff8e05c5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
