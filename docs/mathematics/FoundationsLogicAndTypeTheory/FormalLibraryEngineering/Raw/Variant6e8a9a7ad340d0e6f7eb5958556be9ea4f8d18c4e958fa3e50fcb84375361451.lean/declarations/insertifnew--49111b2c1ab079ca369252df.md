## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fb71482f31d410ad71a4ebb6115be21cb77683a6b4d2f64a84fe8a05591a4b30`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[inline] def insertIfNew [BEq α] [Hashable α] (m : Raw α β) (a : α) (b : β a) : Raw α β :=
  if h : 0 < m.buckets.size then
    (Raw₀.insertIfNew ⟨m, h⟩ a b).1
  else m -- will never happen for well-formed inputs

/--
Checks whether a key is present in a map, and unconditionally inserts a value for the key.

Equivalent to (but potentially faster than) calling `contains` followed by `insert`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Raw/Variant6e8a9a7ad340d0e6f7eb5958556be9ea4f8d18c4e958fa3e50fcb84375361451.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Raw/Variant6e8a9a7ad340d0e6f7eb5958556be9ea4f8d18c4e958fa3e50fcb84375361451.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2e06730534a8940b11e7a2534b6dae40bf114c87` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
