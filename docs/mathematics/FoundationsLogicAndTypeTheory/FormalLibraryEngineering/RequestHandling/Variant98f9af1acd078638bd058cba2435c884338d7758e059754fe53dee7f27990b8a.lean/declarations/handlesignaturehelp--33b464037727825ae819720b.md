## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a865ab41743cbf74de03e50e11e5904772bc2e407eaf2d6d0b547e65746fab18`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 458–466.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def handleSignatureHelp (p : SignatureHelpParams) : RequestM (RequestTask (Option SignatureHelp)) := do
  let doc ← readDoc
  let text := doc.meta.text
  let requestedPos := text.lspPosToUtf8Pos p.position
  mapTaskCostly (findCmdDataAtPos doc requestedPos (includeStop := false)) fun cmdData? => do
    let some (cmdStx, tree) := cmdData?
      | return none
    SignatureHelp.findSignatureHelp? text p.context? cmdStx tree requestedPos

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RequestHandling/Variant98f9af1acd078638bd058cba2435c884338d7758e059754fe53dee7f27990b8a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RequestHandling/Variant98f9af1acd078638bd058cba2435c884338d7758e059754fe53dee7f27990b8a.lean#L458).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d2045a6a52bebcbdb0cb8e08d7b40990b61fd6c7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
