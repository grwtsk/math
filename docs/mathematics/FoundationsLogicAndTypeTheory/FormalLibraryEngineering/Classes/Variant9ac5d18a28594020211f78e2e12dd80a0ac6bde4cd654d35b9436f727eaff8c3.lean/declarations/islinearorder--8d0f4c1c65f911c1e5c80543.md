## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:18a3bc0a95d86c304cfa4019d2289aa911ad5d23c9b707a24b0451260c54070b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–93.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public class IsLinearOrder (α : Type u) [LE α] extends IsPartialOrder α, IsLinearPreorder α

section LT

/--
This typeclass states that the synthesized `LT α` instance is compatible with the `LE α`
instance. This means that `LT.lt a b` holds if and only if `a` is less or equal to `b` according
to the `LE α` instance, but `b` is not less or equal to `a`.

`LawfulOrderLT α` automatically entails that `LT α` is asymmetric: `a < b` and `b < a` can never
be true simultaneously.

`LT α` does not uniquely determine the `LE α`: There can be only one compatible order data
instance that is total, but there can be others that are not total.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Classes/Variant9ac5d18a28594020211f78e2e12dd80a0ac6bde4cd654d35b9436f727eaff8c3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Classes/Variant9ac5d18a28594020211f78e2e12dd80a0ac6bde4cd654d35b9436f727eaff8c3.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `571d41f762de0e22ca3f35ed1ba8f8446aa86f3c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
