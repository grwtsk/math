## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6cc30052d892ef14a65f5c68592a004f38f92ec7498314576a7a3701ea423aa5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 352–360.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[builtin_term_elab Lean.Parser.Term.inferInstanceAs] def elabInferInstanceAs : TermElab := fun stx expectedType? => do
  -- The type argument is the last child (works for both `inferInstanceAs T` and `inferInstanceAs <| T`)
  let typeStx := stx[stx.getNumArgs - 1]!
  if !backward.inferInstanceAs.wrap.get (← getOptions) then
    return (← elabTerm (← `(_root_.inferInstanceAs $(⟨typeStx⟩))) expectedType?)

  let some expectedType ← tryPostponeIfHasMVars? expectedType? |
    throwError (m!"`inferInstanceAs` failed, expected type contains metavariables{indentD expectedType?}" ++
      .note "`inferInstanceAs` requires full knowledge of the expected (\"target\") type to do its \
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/BuiltinTerm/Variantc3e8bb3e4bf34f98324811a1ec07e2f3482002e67c290354ae324e0fd05a428f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/BuiltinTerm/Variantc3e8bb3e4bf34f98324811a1ec07e2f3482002e67c290354ae324e0fd05a428f.lean#L352).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `42da4fd6c8b37be7552d26a5cbf6500ad6184e58` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
