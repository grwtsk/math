## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ac8c517e4b87f1252eb0358a81fd7b3201a72a6ed5379b04ad2a7ec3abf95926`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–208.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
def isMonadApp (type : Expr) : MetaM Bool := do
  let some (m, _) ← isTypeApp? type | return false
  return (← isMonad? m).isSome

/--
Try coercions and monad lifts to make sure `e` has type `expectedType`.

If `expectedType` is of the form `n β`, we try monad lifts and other extensions.

Extensions for monads.

1. Try to unify `n` and `m`. If it succeeds, then we use
  ```
  coeM {m : Type u → Type v} {α β : Type u} [∀ a, CoeT α a β] [Monad m] (x : m α) : m β
  ```
  `n` must be a `Monad` to use this one.

2. If there is monad lift from `m` to `n` and we can unify `α` and `β`, we use
  ```
  liftM : ∀ {m : Type u_1 → Type u_2} {n : Type u_1 → Type u_3} [self : MonadLiftT m n] {α : Type u_1}, m α → n α
  ```
  Note that `n` may not be a `Monad` in this case. This happens quite a bit in code such as
  ```
  def g (x : Nat) : IO Nat := do
    IO.println x
    pure x

  def f {m} [MonadLiftT IO m] : m Nat :=
    g 10

  ```

3. If there is a monad lift from `m` to `n` and a coercion from `α` to `β`, we use
  ```
  liftCoeM {m : Type u → Type v} {n : Type u → Type w} {α β : Type u} [MonadLiftT m n] [∀ a, CoeT α a β] [Monad n] (x : m α) : n β
  ```

Note that approach 3 does not subsume 1 because it is only applicable if there is a coercion from `α` to `β` for all values in `α`.
This is not the case for example for `pure $ x > 0` when the expected type is `IO Bool`. The given type is `IO Prop`, and
we only have a coercion from decidable propositions.  Approach 1 works because it constructs the coercion `CoeT (m Prop) (pure $ x > 0) (m Bool)`
using the instance `pureCoeDepProp`.

Note that, approach 2 is more powerful than `tryCoe`.
Recall that type class resolution never assigns metavariables created by other modules.
Now, consider the following scenario
```lean
def g (x : Nat) : IO Nat := ...
deg h (x : Nat) : StateT Nat IO Nat := do
v ← g x;
IO.Println v;
...
```
Let's assume there is no other occurrence of `v` in `h`.
Thus, we have that the expected of `g x` is `StateT Nat IO ?α`,
and the given type is `IO Nat`. So, even if we add a coercion.
```
instance {α m n} [MonadLiftT m n] {α} : Coe (m α) (n α) := ...
```
It is not applicable because TC would have to assign `?α := Nat`.
On the other hand, TC can easily solve `[MonadLiftT IO (StateT Nat IO)]`
since this goal does not contain any metavariables. And then, we
convert `g x` into `liftM $ g x`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Coe/Variantca14c0a5c8508a6156eaea881981c8cfe58714264cf8782a1c28ae0b56bf6bb1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Coe/Variantca14c0a5c8508a6156eaea881981c8cfe58714264cf8782a1c28ae0b56bf6bb1.lean#L146).
