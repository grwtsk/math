## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b3b04ed7-fe8e-1084-88ea-ccf781e1635e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 923–928.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem get?_eq_get?ₘ [Ord α] (k : α) (l : Impl α (fun _ => β)) :
    Const.get? l k = Const.get?ₘ l k := by
  simp only [Const.get?ₘ]
  induction l using tree_split_ind_no_gen (compare k) <;>
    simp only [*, get?, applyCell, Cell.Const.get?, Cell.empty_inner, Cell.ofEq_inner]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Model/Variant42593bdacc31b2112aadb6f7702258ef41173334a15ea88eddedaac660c2e9d3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Model/Variant42593bdacc31b2112aadb6f7702258ef41173334a15ea88eddedaac660c2e9d3.lean#L923).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5ac2ee3ea36c51f16cef1be36adb3bcd1c274a20` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
