## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2172b6d9fc70362e5dad8ed627d9cbae7acf3899db4abfbe077b70301e9c64ad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 30–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getPowIdentityInst? (u : Level) (type : Expr) : GoalM (Option (Expr × Expr × Nat)) := do withNewMCtxDepth do
  -- We use a fresh metavar for `CommSemiring` (unlike `getIsCharInst?` which pins the semiring)
  -- because `PowIdentity` instances may be declared against a canonical `CommSemiring` instance
  -- that is not definitionally equal to `CommRing.toCommSemiring`. The synthesized `csInst` is
  -- stored and used in proof terms to ensure type-correctness.
  let csInst ← mkFreshExprMVar (mkApp (mkConst ``Grind.CommSemiring [u]) type)
  let p ← mkFreshExprMVar (mkConst ``Nat)
  let powIdentityType := mkApp3 (mkConst ``Grind.PowIdentity [u]) type csInst p
  let some inst ← synthInstance? powIdentityType | return none
  let csInst ← instantiateMVars csInst
  let p ← instantiateMVars p
  let some pVal ← evalNat? p | return none
  return some (inst, csInst, pVal)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Insts/Variant749817a0f3c7c41ac67c5f4d6da3f410746adbd0226207700df2384f20b33d73.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Insts/Variant749817a0f3c7c41ac67c5f4d6da3f410746adbd0226207700df2384f20b33d73.lean#L30).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5a5a43aa13437f93f54515550f7bc0a0a9b71f4a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
