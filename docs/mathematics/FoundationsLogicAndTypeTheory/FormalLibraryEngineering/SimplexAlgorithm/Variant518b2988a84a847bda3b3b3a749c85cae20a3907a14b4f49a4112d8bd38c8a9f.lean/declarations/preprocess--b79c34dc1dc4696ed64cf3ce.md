## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:477697427961137316cc7bfa3c95d182fc50f89ee6f1000442083b0c4c0377e8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 29–39.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def preprocess (matType : ℕ → ℕ → Type) [UsableInSimplexAlgorithm matType] (hyps : List Comp)
    (maxVar : ℕ) : matType (maxVar + 1) (hyps.length) × List Nat :=
  let values : List (ℕ × ℕ × ℚ) := hyps.foldlIdx (init := []) fun idx cur comp =>
    cur ++ comp.coeffs.map fun (var, c) => (var, idx, c)

  let strictIndexes := hyps.findIdxs (·.str == Ineq.lt)
  (ofValues values, strictIndexes)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimplexAlgorithm/Variant518b2988a84a847bda3b3b3a749c85cae20a3907a14b4f49a4112d8bd38c8a9f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimplexAlgorithm/Variant518b2988a84a847bda3b3b3a749c85cae20a3907a14b4f49a4112d8bd38c8a9f.lean#L29).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9d68c417b63089d4712cfa5af4cc498796fa6246` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
