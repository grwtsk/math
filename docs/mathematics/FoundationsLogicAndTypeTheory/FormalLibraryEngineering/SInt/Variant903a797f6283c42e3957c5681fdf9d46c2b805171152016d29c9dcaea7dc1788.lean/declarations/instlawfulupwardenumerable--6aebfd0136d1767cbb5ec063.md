## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:37418f35dbaf6e717c06b07a6aa4804cd0126cd02729b70ae94bc0796130bc54`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 80–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
scoped instance instLawfulUpwardEnumerable [m : HasModel α β] :
    LawfulUpwardEnumerable α where
  ne_of_lt x y := by
    rw [m.lt_iff, ne_eq, ← m.encode_inj]
    apply LawfulUpwardEnumerable.ne_of_lt
  succMany?_zero x := by
    rw [← Option.map_inj_right eq_of_encode_eq, ← succMany?_encode, Option.map_some]
    apply LawfulUpwardEnumerable.succMany?_zero
  succMany?_add_one n x := by
    rw [← Option.map_inj_right eq_of_encode_eq, ← succMany?_encode, Option.map_bind,
      Function.comp_def]
    simp only [← succ?_encode]
    rw [← Function.comp_def, ← Option.bind_map, ← succMany?_encode (n' := n),
      LawfulUpwardEnumerable.succMany?_add_one]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SInt/Variant903a797f6283c42e3957c5681fdf9d46c2b805171152016d29c9dcaea7dc1788.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SInt/Variant903a797f6283c42e3957c5681fdf9d46c2b805171152016d29c9dcaea7dc1788.lean#L80).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f32285ef2b6b568f5b86e81b1787859bfcbc0b98` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
