## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6e3a4c291005d7dfbc6fa6c7b225822162778a0ec12decbcd5fe0d371e0b83af`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 271–283.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[inline] public def SavedTrace.replayIfUpToDate
  [CheckExists ι] [GetMTime ι]
  (info : ι) (depTrace : BuildTrace) (savedTrace : SavedTrace)
  (oldTrace := depTrace.mtime)
: JobM Bool := (·.isUpToDate) <$> savedTrace.replayIfUpToDate' info depTrace oldTrace

/--
Returns `true` if the saved trace exists and its hash matches `inputHash`.

If up-to-date, replays the saved log from the trace and sets the current
build action to `replay`. Otherwise, if the log is empty and trace is synthetic,
or if the trace is not up-to-date, the build action will be set to `reuse`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Common/Variant96cdc77ee8618f1e9863f108186bc152b8f66f1c0bb58764d5adb1a66b4cd7ce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Common/Variant96cdc77ee8618f1e9863f108186bc152b8f66f1c0bb58764d5adb1a66b4cd7ce.lean#L271).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c20647096e000adccb67bf7a9f1107d2eedc18be` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
