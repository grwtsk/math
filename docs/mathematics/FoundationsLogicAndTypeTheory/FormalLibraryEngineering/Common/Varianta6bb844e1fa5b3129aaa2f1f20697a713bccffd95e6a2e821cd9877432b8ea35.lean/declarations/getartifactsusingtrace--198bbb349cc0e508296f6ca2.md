## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0b9590c156b17ebb7396fcb6526dda0d8312908fbfdf5b9c95c3774d3e02274d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 546–569.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[specialize] public def getArtifactsUsingTrace?
  [ResolveOutputs α] (inputHash : Hash) (savedTrace : SavedTrace) (pkg : Package)
: JobM (Option α) := do
  if let .ok data := savedTrace then
    if data.depHash == inputHash then
      if let some out := data.outputs? then
        try
          let arts ← resolveOutputs (.ofData out)
          if (← pkg.isArtifactCacheWritable) then
            let act := (← getLakeCache).writeOutputs pkg.cacheScope inputHash out (overwrite := false)
            if let .error e ← act.toBaseIO then
              logWarning s!"could not write outputs to cache: {e}"
          return some arts
        catch e =>
          dropLogFrom e
  return none

Retrieve artifacts from the Lake cache using the outputs stored in either
the saved trace file or in the cached input-to-content mapping.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Common/Varianta6bb844e1fa5b3129aaa2f1f20697a713bccffd95e6a2e821cd9877432b8ea35.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Common/Varianta6bb844e1fa5b3129aaa2f1f20697a713bccffd95e6a2e821cd9877432b8ea35.lean#L546).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8d0b6d9c95a461dcf0c8fdecbb606ac043a2a404` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
