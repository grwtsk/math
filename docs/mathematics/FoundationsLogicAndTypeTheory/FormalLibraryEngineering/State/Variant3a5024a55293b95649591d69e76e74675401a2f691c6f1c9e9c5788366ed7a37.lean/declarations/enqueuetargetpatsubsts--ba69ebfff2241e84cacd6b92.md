## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ef57577972d195d41d5464850e1b2d019d0504ba247bafcb5cf102aecc08077c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 889–898.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def enqueueTargetPatSubsts (newPatSubsts : Array (ForwardRule × Substitution))
    (fs : ForwardState) : ForwardState :=
  -- TODO Instead of erasing all target pattern substitutions, erase only those
  -- not present in the new target.
  let fs := fs.eraseTargetPatSubsts
  fs.enqueuePatSubsts .target newPatSubsts

/-- Update the forward state. This applies any previously enqueued changes to
all rule states, potentially generating new complete matches in the process.
If a phase is given, only rules from that phase are updated. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/State/Variant3a5024a55293b95649591d69e76e74675401a2f691c6f1c9e9c5788366ed7a37.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/State/Variant3a5024a55293b95649591d69e76e74675401a2f691c6f1c9e9c5788366ed7a37.lean#L889).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `74d8fdc9f1b41015680168a96479c29275caaba7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
