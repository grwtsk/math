## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:af96edcacbd4558af17121f82a3ec102f046addfb5b2f326670bbf2b67dd1a83`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 43–64.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
public def findImportsFromSource (path : System.FilePath) : IO (Array Name) := do
  -- Note: we use `filter` rather than `erase`, since module-system files may contain
  -- both an implicit `public import Init` and a `meta import Init`, so `Init` can
  -- appear more than once in the parsed imports.
  return (← Lean.parseImports' (← IO.FS.readFile path) path.toString).imports
    |>.map (·.module) |>.filter (· != `Init)

/--
Compute the transitive closure of imports starting from a source file.

Returns a `NameSet` of all modules that are transitively imported by the given file,
by recursively parsing source files.

**Example:**
```lean
-- Get all transitive Mathlib imports
let imports ← findTransitiveImportsFromSource "Mathlib/Algebra/Ring/Basic.lean" (some `Mathlib)

-- Get all transitive imports regardless of namespace
let allImports ← findTransitiveImportsFromSource "MyFile.lean"
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FromSource/Variant454f31891bb1c2daa26c510d383aa970add06e6fa7fada03b427bf6d2233a6a8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FromSource/Variant454f31891bb1c2daa26c510d383aa970add06e6fa7fada03b427bf6d2233a6a8.lean#L43).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d2191a7fe1441a3cb62f870b3ae1fffa99bfd326` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
