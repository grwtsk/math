## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5d75b75886580589c12b522b400f9f64072076d45113d74c0aedaa5bda2a4b23`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 351–366.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def withLetDeclsDND (declInfos : Array (Name × Expr × Expr))
    (k : Array Expr → VCGenM Expr) : VCGenM Expr :=
  loop #[]
where
  loop (acc : Array Expr) : VCGenM Expr := do
    if h : acc.size < declInfos.size then
      let (name, type, value) := declInfos[acc.size]
      Meta.withLetDecl name type value fun fv => loop (acc.push fv)
    else
      k acc
  termination_by declInfos.size - acc.size

/-- Elaborate a matched `frames` alternative's frame term at the resource type `resourceTy` of the
applicable frame operator, with each named pattern variable bound to the subterm the pattern matched.
The bindings are introduced as `let`-declarations carrying the matched value, so the resulting frame
records the pattern-variable assignments and the user sees them in the side goals. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Solve/Variantd820f988516e79c03dea79f8eb4378ac70ad9d7fc26a19be8c9e66c01aea5c28.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Solve/Variantd820f988516e79c03dea79f8eb4378ac70ad9d7fc26a19be8c9e66c01aea5c28.lean#L351).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f28269f362e6f6f19645e8560a052fe9c02e9623` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
