## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b3307ad59fcaeec8367f48b421e1ce524c44229826f7ae5cbe24fa77b959a5de`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 316–340.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def applySpec (scope : VCGen.Scope) (goal : MVarId) (info : WPApp) (thm : SpecTheorem) :
    VCGenM SolveResult := do
  trace[Elab.Tactic.Do.vcgen] "Applying spec {thm.proof} for {info.prog}. Excess args: {info.excessArgs}"
  let some rule ←
    try
      mkBackwardRuleFromSpecCached thm info |>.run
    catch ex =>
      throwError "Failed to construct rule {thm.proof} for {indentExpr info.prog}\n\
        error: {ex.toMessageData}\n\
        target:{indentExpr (← goal.getType)}\n\
        Pred:{indentExpr info.Pred}\n\
        excessArgs: {info.excessArgs}"
    | return ← stopOrErrorOnMissingSpec info.prog info.M #[thm]
  let .goals goals ← rule.applyChecked goal m!"spec rule for{indentExpr info.prog}"
    | do
      let ruleType ← Meta.inferType rule.expr
      throwError "Failed to apply rule {thm.proof} for {indentExpr info.prog}\n\
        target:{indentExpr (← goal.getType)}\n\
        Pred:{indentExpr info.Pred}\n\
        excessArgs: {info.excessArgs}\n\
        rule type:{indentExpr ruleType}"
  return .goals scope goals

/-- True iff the program matches the `until` pattern, in which case VC generation stops at this
goal. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Solve/Variantd820f988516e79c03dea79f8eb4378ac70ad9d7fc26a19be8c9e66c01aea5c28.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Solve/Variantd820f988516e79c03dea79f8eb4378ac70ad9d7fc26a19be8c9e66c01aea5c28.lean#L316).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f28269f362e6f6f19645e8560a052fe9c02e9623` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
