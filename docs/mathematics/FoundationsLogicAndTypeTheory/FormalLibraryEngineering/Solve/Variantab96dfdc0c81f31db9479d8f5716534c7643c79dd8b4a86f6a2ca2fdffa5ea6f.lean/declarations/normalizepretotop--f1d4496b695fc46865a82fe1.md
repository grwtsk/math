## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5d870429bf750843fa7f4ab658fa7fea2d3692db657a84d9a02a83a3bc052825`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 174–188.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def normalizePreToTop? (goal : MVarId) (pre target : Expr) : VCGenM (Option (List MVarId)) := do
  if pre.isTrue then
    let .goals [g] ← (← read).backwardRules.truePreIntro.applyChecked goal
      | throwError "Failed to apply {.ofConstName ``Lean.Order.true_le_of_top_le} to{indentExpr target}"
    return some [g]
  if let some g ← reduceTopAppliedPre? goal target pre then
    return some [g]
  return none

/-- Phase 2: drive the precondition of `pre ⊑ rhs` toward `⊤`, lifting any pure content into the
local context so a later spec application sees a `⊤` precondition. In order: cancel a redundant
`⊓ ⊤`; lift an embedded `⌜φ⌝` (before state-argument introduction, which would otherwise leave
`⌜φ⌝` applied to the introduced state); introduce excess state arguments; drop a `True`
precondition; lift a bare `Prop` precondition. Returns the updated scope, recording any lifted
hypothesis. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Solve/Variantab96dfdc0c81f31db9479d8f5716534c7643c79dd8b4a86f6a2ca2fdffa5ea6f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Solve/Variantab96dfdc0c81f31db9479d8f5716534c7643c79dd8b4a86f6a2ca2fdffa5ea6f.lean#L174).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5628e82bb9a7a689b3776d46674102654293213e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
