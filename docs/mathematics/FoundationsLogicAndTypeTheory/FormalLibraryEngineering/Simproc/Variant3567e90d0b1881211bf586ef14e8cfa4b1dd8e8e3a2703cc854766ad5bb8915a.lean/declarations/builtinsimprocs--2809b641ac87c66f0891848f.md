## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ae7572416742c7e10ad5654e7648f9fe1f32b8b0eae9073bbbe6326915ce7f4f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 31–41.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure BuiltinSimprocs where
  keys  : Std.HashMap Name (Array SimpTheoremKey) := {}
  procs : Std.HashMap Name (Sum Simproc DSimproc) := {}
  deriving Inhabited

/--
This global reference is populated using the command `builtin_simproc_pattern%`.

This reference is then used to process the attributes `builtin_simproc` and `builtin_sevalproc`.
Both attributes need the keys and the actual procedure registered using the command `builtin_simproc_pattern%`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Simproc/Variant3567e90d0b1881211bf586ef14e8cfa4b1dd8e8e3a2703cc854766ad5bb8915a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Simproc/Variant3567e90d0b1881211bf586ef14e8cfa4b1dd8e8e3a2703cc854766ad5bb8915a.lean#L31).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0ad940daf61f35aa2ef047582ba0c9c3aa907223` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
