## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4980cd1bb4ecf038009770c08583f4e1fdb11f0b07e221255aab2e72b07be6fa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 46–58.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def blastExtractAndExtendBit (aig : AIG α) (target : ExtractAndExtendBitTarget aig w) :
    AIG.RefVecEntry α w :=
  -- extract 1 bit starting from start
  let ⟨start, x⟩ := target
  let res := blastExtract aig ⟨x, start⟩
  let aig := res.aig
  let extract := res.vec
  -- zero-extend the extracted portion to have
  let res := blastZeroExtend aig (newWidth := w) ⟨1, extract⟩
  let aig := res.aig
  let extend := res.vec
  ⟨aig, extend⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Cpop/Variantad66240b962ef8c5e73f5e46b56de8e8c22d24905ed1b6909a24afca47136bb2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Cpop/Variantad66240b962ef8c5e73f5e46b56de8e8c22d24905ed1b6909a24afca47136bb2.lean#L46).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `36bbfc698eb01959203cb13d1790a773ccc54009` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
