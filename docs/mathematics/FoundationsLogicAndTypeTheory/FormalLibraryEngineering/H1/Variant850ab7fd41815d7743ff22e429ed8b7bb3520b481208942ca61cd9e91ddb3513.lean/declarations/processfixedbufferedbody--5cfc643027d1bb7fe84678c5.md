## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:091e668435a29f751498efe550c1b964d138e7beb9d24d7dc9c64444b9525ae4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1115–1147.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private partial def processFixedBufferedBody (machine : Machine dir) (n : Nat) : Machine dir :=
  let writer := machine.writer
  let bufferedBytes := bufferedUserDataBytes writer
  if bufferedBytes > n then
    -- More bytes than declared fixed length. Close the connection instead of
    -- silently truncating and presenting a complete payload to the peer.
    closeOnBadMessage machine
  else if bufferedBytes = n ∧ !writer.userClosedBody then
    -- Do not flush the final fixed-length bytes until the producer closes.
    -- This lets us detect late overflow chunks as protocol violations.
    machine
  else
    let (writer, remaining) := Writer.writeFixedBody writer n
    let machine := { machine with writer }
    let writer := machine.writer
    if remaining = 0 then
      if writer.userData.isEmpty then
        if writer.userClosedBody then
          completeWriterMessage machine
        else
          machine.setWriterState (.writingBodyFixed 0)
      else
        closeOnBadMessage machine
    else
      machine.setWriterState (.writingBodyFixed remaining)

/--
Handles fixed-length writer state when no user bytes are currently buffered.

If the producer closed without providing all declared bytes, closes both
reader and writer and terminates the connection.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/H1/Variant850ab7fd41815d7743ff22e429ed8b7bb3520b481208942ca61cd9e91ddb3513.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/H1/Variant850ab7fd41815d7743ff22e429ed8b7bb3520b481208942ca61cd9e91ddb3513.lean#L1115).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e244ad062e99c3043e796a2a97ac54bbdb7a8215` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
