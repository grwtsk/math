## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b0c8a17713a440f4c02bd3a964755d1859ef4ded5d3d153b6e93bdfa6eb7e812`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 270–293.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def hostAuthorityMatchesConnectAuthority
    (authority : URI.Authority)
    (hostHeader : Header.Host) : Bool :=
  authority.host == hostHeader.host &&
    (authority.port == hostHeader.port ||
      match authority.port, hostHeader.port with
      | .value port, .omitted => isDefaultTunnelPort port
      | _, _ => false)

/--
Validates the required `Host` header for HTTP/1.1 requests:
exactly one value that is either empty or parseable as a valid host.

As defined in RFC 9112 Section 3.2:

"A client MUST send a Host header field (Section 7.2 of [HTTP]) in all HTTP/1.1 request messages.
If the target URI includes an authority component, then a client MUST send a field value for Host that
is identical to that authority component, excluding any userinfo subcomponent and its "@"
delimiter (Section 4.2 of [HTTP]). If the authority component is missing or undefined for the target
URI, then a client MUST send a Host header field with an empty field value."

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/H1/Variant850ab7fd41815d7743ff22e429ed8b7bb3520b481208942ca61cd9e91ddb3513.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/H1/Variant850ab7fd41815d7743ff22e429ed8b7bb3520b481208942ca61cd9e91ddb3513.lean#L270).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e244ad062e99c3043e796a2a97ac54bbdb7a8215` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
