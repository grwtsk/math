## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f53ec67505bf46ca8cc4e7e37cca5db77db10a54bc075e90beeba9e578e82573`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1317–1331.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def parseFixedBody (machine : Machine dir) (size : Nat) :
    Machine dir × Option PulledChunk × Bool :=
  let (machine, result) := parseWith machine (parseFixedSizeData size) (limit := none) (some size)
  match result with
  | some (.complete body) =>
    emitBodyChunk machine .complete true false #[] body (closeBody := true)
  | some (.incomplete body remaining) =>
    -- In fixed-length framing this is a partial body segment, not a chunked-frame fragment.
    emitBodyChunk machine (.readBody (.fixed remaining)) false false #[] body
  | none =>
    bodyNoProgress machine

/--
Parses next chunk-size line in chunked mode and transitions to chunk-data state.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/H1/Varianta41b71cf0d32018f66ec40eba22afb2975608beee1d3330db8b953e67120c3cb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/H1/Varianta41b71cf0d32018f66ec40eba22afb2975608beee1d3330db8b953e67120c3cb.lean#L1317).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ebfa37bf07bbdf9ecde9e0ba367ba6db9b9b9c35` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
