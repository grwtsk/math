## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:50dfe9429f320916d26f351d4c587a6ecf3ff22d29803b2424d099cedce3f033`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1165–1177.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private partial def processChunkedBody (machine : Machine dir) : Machine dir :=
  if machine.writer.omitBody then
    completeOmittedBody machine
  else if machine.writer.userClosedBody then
    machine.modifyWriter Writer.writeFinalChunk |> completeWriterMessage
  else if machine.writer.userData.size > 0 then
    machine.modifyWriter Writer.writeChunkedBody |> processWrite
  else
    machine

/--
Processes connection-close body output (HTTP/1.0 server, unknown body length).

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/H1/Varianta41b71cf0d32018f66ec40eba22afb2975608beee1d3330db8b953e67120c3cb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/H1/Varianta41b71cf0d32018f66ec40eba22afb2975608beee1d3330db8b953e67120c3cb.lean#L1165).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ebfa37bf07bbdf9ecde9e0ba367ba6db9b9b9c35` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
