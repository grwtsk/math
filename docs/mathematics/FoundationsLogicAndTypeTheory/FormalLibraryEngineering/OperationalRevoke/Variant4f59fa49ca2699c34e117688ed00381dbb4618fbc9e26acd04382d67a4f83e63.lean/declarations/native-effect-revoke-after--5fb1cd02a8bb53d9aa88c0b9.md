## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c5f47870-c681-db07-0586-a7ecfdf042a5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 498–506.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem native_effect_revoke_after :
    (revokeCore effectState effectEvent).1 = .revoked ∧
    (revokeCore effectState effectEvent).2.revision = 3 ∧
    lookup (revokeCore effectState effectEvent).2.grants ("", "g1") =
      some { effectRecord with revoked := true } := by
  simp [revokeCore, effectState, effectEvent, authorizedActor, targetKey, lookup,
    effectRecord, changed, markRevoked]

/-- Native `ancestor_revoke`: root and child remain distinct issuer/id occurrences. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/OperationalRevoke/Variant4f59fa49ca2699c34e117688ed00381dbb4618fbc9e26acd04382d67a4f83e63.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/OperationalRevoke/Variant4f59fa49ca2699c34e117688ed00381dbb4618fbc9e26acd04382d67a4f83e63.lean#L498).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `88fac1787917981abc37a2801379433e08cb65c2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
