## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5e0a2f98fe76dcbcd9935b8b00f3590579ff5cdc7143d5daf3112caa7a11173a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 598–601.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def rootValue : GrantValue :=
  ⟨"g1", scope, 0, 100, 3, 9, .delegated "owner" none 3 ["bob", "carol", "dana"]⟩

/-- Native ancestor_revoke child DTO with Alice as issuer and owner/g1 as parent. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/OperationalRevoke/Variant1cc672ae98cbf6194ed89e89db7a6292d42f28082814689ed5aba53d8d55ca6d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/OperationalRevoke/Variant1cc672ae98cbf6194ed89e89db7a6292d42f28082814689ed5aba53d8d55ca6d.lean#L598).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6ed13df2f85d10ded8c0730d3ef933a59efeff73` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
