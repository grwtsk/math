## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bd8b2eb1aa64b931c0dc35a4cd92f60ff2b673630f715b9c157b2dae4188e1ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 307–324.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def CongrResult.trans (res1 res2 : CongrResult) : CongrResult where
  lhs := res1.lhs
  rhs := res2.rhs
  pf? :=
    if res1.isRfl then
      res2.pf?
    else if res2.isRfl then
      res1.pf?
    else
      some fun
        | .eq => do mkEqTrans (← res1.eq) (← res2.eq)
        | .heq => do mkHEqTrans (← res1.heq) (← res2.heq)

/-- Make a `CongrResult` from a LHS, a RHS, and a proof of an Iff, Eq, or HEq.
The proof is allowed to have a metavariable for its type.
Validates the inputs and throws errors in the `pf?` function.

The `pf?` function is responsible for finally unifying the type of `pf` with `lhs` and `rhs`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TermCongr/Variant2125a773db37f8bf6f23f5d4eab90f44be344dfebe218a94bd9c2692dbff1c38.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TermCongr/Variant2125a773db37f8bf6f23f5d4eab90f44be344dfebe218a94bd9c2692dbff1c38.lean#L307).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `48c2c2ac2291f3db25e5541b52945c4d78ce245d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
