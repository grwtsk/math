## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f300d56f4a3f6f65b568bc3eb36306e8fb55fae76b1ff411786e9ab90983107e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–174.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def elabCHole (h : Syntax) (forLhs : Bool) (expectedType? : Option Expr) : Term.TermElabM Expr := do
  let pf ← Term.elabTerm h none
  let pfTy ← inferType pf
  -- Ensure that `pfTy` is a proposition
  unless ← isDefEq (← inferType pfTy) (.sort .zero) do
    throwError "Hole has type{indentD pfTy}\nbut is expected to be a Prop"
  if let some (_, lhs, _, rhs) := (← whnf pfTy).sides? then
    let val := if forLhs then lhs else rhs
    if let some expectedType := expectedType? then
      -- Propagate type hint:
      discard <| isDefEq expectedType (← inferType val)
    mkCHole forLhs val pf
  else
    -- Since `pf` doesn't yet have sides, we resort to the value and the proof being decoupled.
    -- These will be unified during congruence generation.
    mkCHole forLhs (← mkFreshExprMVar expectedType?) pf

/-- (Internal for `congr(...)`)
Elaborates to an expression satisfying `cHole?` that equals the LHS or RHS of `h`,
if the LHS or RHS is available after elaborating `h`. Uses the expected type as a hint. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TermCongr/Variant2f58de9a0e38aa548aa4f8f22a712e1d67faae4ce4f16bd14af16a204d78f714.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TermCongr/Variant2f58de9a0e38aa548aa4f8f22a712e1d67faae4ce4f16bd14af16a204d78f714.lean#L155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c76112d1f1a838af5b3d3645665dd0eea3b0ada1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
