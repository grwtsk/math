## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bbbd5d47a306607f81a9bc64b4c1976f4b07a2002a9dee396602ed99fab0634e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 441–469.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkCongrOfCHole? (mvarCounterSaved : Nat) (lhs rhs : Expr) : MetaM (Option CongrResult) := do
  match cHole? lhs mvarCounterSaved, cHole? rhs mvarCounterSaved with
  | some (isLhs1, val1, pf1), some (isLhs2, val2, pf2) =>
    trace[Elab.congr] "mkCongrOfCHole, both holes"
    unless isLhs1 == true do
      throwCongrEx lhs rhs "A RHS congruence hole leaked into the LHS"
    unless isLhs2 == false do
      throwCongrEx lhs rhs "A LHS congruence hole leaked into the RHS"
    -- Defeq checks to unify the lhs and rhs congruence holes.
    unless ← isDefEq (← inferType pf1) (← inferType pf2) do
      throwCongrEx lhs rhs "Elaborated types of congruence holes are not defeq."
    if let some (_, lhsVal, _, rhsVal) := (← whnf <| ← inferType pf1).sides? then
      unless ← isDefEq val1 lhsVal do
        throwError "Left-hand side of congruence hole is{indentD lhsVal}\n\
          but is expected to be{indentD val1}"
      unless ← isDefEq val2 rhsVal do
        throwError "Right-hand side of congruence hole is{indentD rhsVal}\n\
          but is expected to be{indentD val2}"
    return some <| CongrResult.mk' val1 val2 pf1
  | some .., none =>
    throwCongrEx lhs rhs "Right-hand side lost its congruence hole annotation."
  | none, some .. =>
    throwCongrEx lhs rhs "Left-hand side lost its congruence hole annotation."
  | none, none => return none

/--
Given two applications of the same arity, gives `Expr.getAppFn` of both,
but if these functions are equal, gives the longest common prefix.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TermCongr/Varianta91e44df2ebe9455dd5c526cce1556239157992f89bea61f045f2705e81f9a3f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TermCongr/Varianta91e44df2ebe9455dd5c526cce1556239157992f89bea61f045f2705e81f9a3f.lean#L441).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0623f8b1fc5d36eb06aa5771519f24d226b99e21` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
