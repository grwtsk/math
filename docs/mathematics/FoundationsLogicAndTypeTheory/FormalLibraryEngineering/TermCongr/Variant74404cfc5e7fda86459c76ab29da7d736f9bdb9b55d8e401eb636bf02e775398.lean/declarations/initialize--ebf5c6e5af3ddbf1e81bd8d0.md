## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `initialize` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:50696915787a64b31ad1dd73465caa16339d058d7ae11133c919c41c57537cf3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 53–76.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
initialize registerTraceClass `Elab.congr

/--
`congr(expr)` generates an congruence from an expression containing
congruence holes of the form `$h` or `$(h)`.
In these congruence holes, `h : a = b` indicates that, in the generated congruence,
on the left-hand side `a` is substituted for `$h`
and on the right-hand side `b` is substituted for `$h`.

For example, if `h : a = b` then `congr(1 + $h) : 1 + a = 1 + b`.

This is able to make use of the expected type, for example `(congr(_ + $h) : 1 + _ = _)`
with `h : x = y` gives `1 + x = 1 + y`.
The expected type can be an `Iff`, `Eq`, or `HEq`.
If there is no expected type, then it generates an equality.

Note: the process of generating a congruence lemma involves elaborating the pattern
using terms with attached metadata and a reducible wrapper.
We try to avoid doing so, but these terms can leak into the local context through unification.
This can potentially break tactics that are sensitive to metadata or reducible functions.
Please report anything that goes wrong with `congr(...)` lemmas on Zulip.

For debugging, you can set `set_option trace.Elab.congr true`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TermCongr/Variant74404cfc5e7fda86459c76ab29da7d736f9bdb9b55d8e401eb636bf02e775398.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TermCongr/Variant74404cfc5e7fda86459c76ab29da7d736f9bdb9b55d8e401eb636bf02e775398.lean#L53).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c6ed0521e7097a3aade6fa0ef779b2d8b50e38e5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
