## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `syntax` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d1b6581e9c9e29553e73497a2ff0aa80b8d94cfbe01f19510b741b2cb07f1b26`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 77–88.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
syntax (name := termCongr) "congr(" withoutForbidden(ppDedentIfGrouped(term)) ")" : term

/-! ### Congruence holes

This section sets up the way congruence holes are elaborated for `congr(...)` quotations.
The basic problem is that if we have `$h` with `h : x = y`, we need to elaborate it once
as `x` and once as `y`, and in both cases the term needs to remember that it's associated
to `h`.

/-- Key for congruence hole metadata.
For a `Bool` recording whether this hole is for the LHS elaboration. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TermCongr/Variant74404cfc5e7fda86459c76ab29da7d736f9bdb9b55d8e401eb636bf02e775398.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TermCongr/Variant74404cfc5e7fda86459c76ab29da7d736f9bdb9b55d8e401eb636bf02e775398.lean#L77).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c6ed0521e7097a3aade6fa0ef779b2d8b50e38e5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
