## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6d7a07b8b5e82c20df666c2aaaa8392c01c7deca23f8864c120482d71f39cdba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 409–418.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def CongrResult.mkDefault (lhs rhs : Expr) : MetaM CongrResult := do
  if ← isDefEq lhs rhs then
    return {lhs, rhs, pf? := none}
  else if let some pf ← (observing? <| mkAppM ``Subsingleton.elim #[lhs, rhs]) then
    return CongrResult.mk' lhs rhs pf
  else if let some pf ← (observing? <| mkAppM ``proof_irrel_heq #[lhs, rhs]) then
    return CongrResult.mk' lhs rhs pf
  throwError "Could not generate congruence between{indentD lhs}\nand{indentD rhs}"

/-- Does `CongrResult.mkDefault` but makes sure there are no lingering congruence holes. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TermCongr/Variantb1b941a328673e3bc9cfeedbb5189147b37d1c6775022fecb92aba67b475aa15.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TermCongr/Variantb1b941a328673e3bc9cfeedbb5189147b37d1c6775022fecb92aba67b475aa15.lean#L409).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `65928f43409ed6953f17ef2b35229ebd8930f001` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
