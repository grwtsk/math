## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:63397d2875c2a7fd2df1d295f77a31eaac09ef41ba2e62350afa51941b2fe7b3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 635–644.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getRoundtrippingUserName? (lctx : LocalContext) (fvarId : FVarId) : Option Name := do
  let ldecl₁ ← lctx.find? fvarId
  let ldecl₂ ← lctx.findFromUserName? ldecl₁.userName
  guard <| ldecl₁.fvarId == ldecl₂.fvarId
  some ldecl₁.userName

/--
Sort the given `FVarId`s by the order in which they appear in `lctx`. If any of
the `FVarId`s do not appear in `lctx`, the result is unspecified.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LocalContext/Variant80065338728efb36a3f895aed30bb799adbf5df90438880936bc077835917a6c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LocalContext/Variant80065338728efb36a3f895aed30bb799adbf5df90438880936bc077835917a6c.lean#L635).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b70a646cd7bceed2d536a20ce52dc2fffe6b4df5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
