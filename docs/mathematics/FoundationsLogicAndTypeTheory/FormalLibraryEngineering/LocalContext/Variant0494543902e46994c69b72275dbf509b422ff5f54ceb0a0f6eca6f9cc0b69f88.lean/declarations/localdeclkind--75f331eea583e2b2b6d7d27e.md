## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:956e84d178a2cdcf362036ee0571c3b5d565b7f9a73ee8a871bfc9c3e29852bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 23–54.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive LocalDeclKind
  /--
  Participates fully in type class search, tactics, and is shown even if inaccessible.

  For example: the `x` in `fun x => _` has the default kind.
  -/
  | default
  /--
  Invisible to type class search or tactics, and hidden in the goal display.

  This kind is used for temporary variables in macros.
  For example: `return (← foo) + bar` expands to
  `foo >>= fun __tmp => pure (__tmp + bar)`,
  where `__tmp` has the `implDetail` kind.
  -/
  | implDetail
  /--
  Auxiliary local declaration for recursive calls.
  The behavior is similar to `implDetail`.

  For example: `def foo (n : Nat) : Nat := _` adds the local declaration
  `foo : Nat → Nat` to allow recursive calls.
  This declaration has the `auxDecl` kind.
  -/
  | auxDecl
  deriving Inhabited, Repr, DecidableEq, Hashable

/-- A declaration for a `LocalContext`. This is used to register which free variables are in scope.

See `LocalDecl.index`, `LocalDecl.fvarId`, `LocalDecl.userName`, `LocalDecl.type` for accessors for
arguments common to both constructors.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LocalContext/Variant0494543902e46994c69b72275dbf509b422ff5f54ceb0a0f6eca6f9cc0b69f88.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LocalContext/Variant0494543902e46994c69b72275dbf509b422ff5f54ceb0a0f6eca6f9cc0b69f88.lean#L23).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d7d25d1abb831ef7d116f1bc9f5d17dbadc91c89` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
