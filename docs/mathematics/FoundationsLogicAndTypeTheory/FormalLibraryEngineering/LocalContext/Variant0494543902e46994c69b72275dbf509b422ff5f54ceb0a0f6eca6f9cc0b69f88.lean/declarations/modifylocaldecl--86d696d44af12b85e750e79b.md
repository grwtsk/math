## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:79f29de9e8e2886dd8a1e450edde4fc3b0646e31d8b41d33b40547e78c036cd8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 444–459.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[inline] def modifyLocalDecl (lctx : LocalContext) (fvarId : FVarId) (f : LocalDecl → LocalDecl) : LocalContext :=
  match lctx with
  | { fvarIdToDecl := map, decls := decls, auxDeclToFullName } =>
    match lctx.find? fvarId with
    | none      => lctx
    | some decl =>
      let decl := f decl
      { fvarIdToDecl := map.insert decl.fvarId decl
        decls        := decls.set decl.index decl
        auxDeclToFullName }

/--
Low-level function for updating every declaration in the local context.
Assumptions about `f`, the resulting nested expressions must be definitionally equal to their original values,
and neither the `index` nor `fvarId` are modified.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LocalContext/Variant0494543902e46994c69b72275dbf509b422ff5f54ceb0a0f6eca6f9cc0b69f88.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LocalContext/Variant0494543902e46994c69b72275dbf509b422ff5f54ceb0a0f6eca6f9cc0b69f88.lean#L444).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d7d25d1abb831ef7d116f1bc9f5d17dbadc91c89` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
