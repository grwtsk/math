## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fcf0aa187daef7e873682f962b71f94b8b3ce89e839ffdd2a9bef2169046dcf4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 269–280.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[extern "lean_uint16_to_float32"] def UInt16.toFloat32 (n : UInt16) : Float32 :=
  .ofModel (.ofUInt16 n)
/--
Obtains a `Float32` whose value is near the given `UInt32`.

It will be exactly the value of the given `UInt32` if such a `Float32` exists. If no such `Float32`
exists, the returned value will either be the smallest `Float32` that is larger than the given
value, or the largest `Float32` that is smaller than the given value.

This function has a logical model in terms of `Float32.Model`, but is overridden at runtime with an
efficient implementation.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Float32/Variant14821ef360a642a34d840cbc5a9dbb11365b77320e71fe7849a451041d39dd1b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Float32/Variant14821ef360a642a34d840cbc5a9dbb11365b77320e71fe7849a451041d39dd1b.lean#L269).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `25cd9430239841cdf8ee647f5f5ef9797c6f13fd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
