## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cf693bcc2130cc3d71114b4ad507e0369d76132cbf6244e85d3dfa846791a7ff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 56–66.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def alternativeOfTactic (env : Environment) (tac : Name) : Option Name :=
  match env.getModuleIdxFor? tac with
  | some modIdx =>
    match (tacticAlternativeExt.getModuleEntries env modIdx).binSearch (tac, .anonymous) (Name.quickLt ·.1 ·.1) with
    | some (_, val) => some val
    | none => none
  | none => tacticAlternativeExt.getState env |>.find? tac

/--
Find all alternatives for a given canonical tactic name.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Doc/Variant592e84e8b0620465d65925eb390066c55921e6250704ac2c802d8c652824f414.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Doc/Variant592e84e8b0620465d65925eb390066c55921e6250704ac2c802d8c652824f414.lean#L56).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6d1de49262b0e93de41c35059c8524ffb07218fd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
