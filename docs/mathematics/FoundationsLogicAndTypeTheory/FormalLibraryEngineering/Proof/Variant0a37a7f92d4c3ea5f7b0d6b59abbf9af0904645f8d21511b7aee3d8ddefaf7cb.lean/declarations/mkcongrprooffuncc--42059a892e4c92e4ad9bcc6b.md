## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:957a95a6ae5b1219489b8e5c252c265229e06c72fee704f71dcc12360be9d0fb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 234–247.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
  private partial def mkCongrProofFunCC (lhs rhs : Expr) (heq : Bool) : GoalM Expr := do
    let rec go (e₁ e₂ : Expr) (numArgs : Nat) : GoalM Expr := do
      let .app f _ := e₁ | unreachable!
      let .app g _ := e₂ | unreachable!
      let numArgs := numArgs + 1
      if isSameExpr f g then
        mkHCongrProof' f g numArgs lhs rhs heq
      else if (← hasSameType f g) then
        mkHCongrProof' f g numArgs lhs rhs heq
      else
        go f g numArgs
    go lhs rhs 0

  /-- Constructs a congruence proof for `lhs` and `rhs`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Proof/Variant0a37a7f92d4c3ea5f7b0d6b59abbf9af0904645f8d21511b7aee3d8ddefaf7cb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Proof/Variant0a37a7f92d4c3ea5f7b0d6b59abbf9af0904645f8d21511b7aee3d8ddefaf7cb.lean#L234).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8f7f38f5ea05a9d2fc3c433fb6b87d5611b781d7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
