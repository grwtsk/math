## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2cd3e64b250928154ed27537e9fd0f322ec5dd13643555a2c9960a8bf4a117ea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 129–141.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
  private partial def mkNestedProofCongr (lhs rhs : Expr) (heq : Bool) : GoalM Expr := do
    let p  := lhs.appFn!.appArg!
    let hp := lhs.appArg!
    let q  := rhs.appFn!.appArg!
    let hq := rhs.appArg!
    let h  := mkApp5 (mkConst ``Lean.Grind.nestedProof_congr) p q (← mkEqProofCore p q false) hp hq
    mkEqOfHEqIfNeeded h heq

  /--
  Given `lhs` and `rhs` proof terms of the form `nestedDecidable p hp` and `nestedDecidable q hq`,
  constructs a congruence proof for `nestedDecidable p hp ≍ nestedDecidable q hq`.
  `p` and `q` are in the same equivalence class.
  -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Proof/Variant5d5d431505d4f1bc5e19695aa6b7a2b381562ac50fdd285708ea9c37d650dd9f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Proof/Variant5d5d431505d4f1bc5e19695aa6b7a2b381562ac50fdd285708ea9c37d650dd9f.lean#L129).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4a17193eb3517bce6e0b8e464a0b81098e6a11b8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
