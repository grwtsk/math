## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7798988b-c5e3-559e-9d0e-938c968cff6d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 140–151.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public theorem ReaderT.ensures_of_wp_run [Monad m] [WP m ps] [WPSound m ps]
    {α : Type u} {ρ : Type u} {prog : ReaderT ρ m α} (r : ρ) (P : α → Prop)
    (hwp : ⊢ₛ wp⟦prog⟧ (⇓? a => ⌜P a⌝) r) :
    Internal.Ensures P (prog.run r) := by

  exact hwp

/--
Pure-proposition soundness: from a `MonadAttach.CanReturn` witness for `prog.run r` and a
`wp`-provable postcondition, conclude `P a`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Sound/Variantcdfff649de4187ecc49e89862cc1a8ec4799a5251ae18edc6aa35fabac1384f3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Sound/Variantcdfff649de4187ecc49e89862cc1a8ec4799a5251ae18edc6aa35fabac1384f3.lean#L140).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `20366acd20427db38dd653495188cc6d529f18f0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
