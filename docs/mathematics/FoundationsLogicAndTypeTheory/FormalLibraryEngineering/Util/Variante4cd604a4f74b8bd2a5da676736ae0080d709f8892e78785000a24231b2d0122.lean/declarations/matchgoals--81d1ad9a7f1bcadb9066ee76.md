## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f69eab636f52d39b0607da1a5631d5c98e556922c4cc7b32efc150faebf131c8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 35–53.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def matchGoals (postState₁ postState₂ : Meta.SavedState)
    (goals₁ goals₂ : Array MVarId) : MetaM (Option (Std.HashMap MVarId MVarId)) := do
  let goals₁ ← getProperGoals postState₁ goals₁
  let goals₂ ← getProperGoals postState₂ goals₂
  let (equal, s) ←
    tacticStatesEqualUpToIds' none postState₁.meta.mctx
      postState₂.meta.mctx goals₁ goals₂ (allowAssignmentDiff := true)
  if ! equal then
    return none
  else
    return s.equalMVarIds
where
  getProperGoals (state : Meta.SavedState) (goals : Array MVarId) :
      MetaM (Array MVarId) :=
    state.runMetaM' do
      let (properGoals, _) ← partitionGoalsAndMVars id goals
      return properGoals.map (·.fst)

end Aesop.Script
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Util/Variante4cd604a4f74b8bd2a5da676736ae0080d709f8892e78785000a24231b2d0122.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Util/Variante4cd604a4f74b8bd2a5da676736ae0080d709f8892e78785000a24231b2d0122.lean#L35).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e49b14ed877a9ec6bd919ba5d80aad28db5fb02c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
