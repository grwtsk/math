## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:29cfa5dc3b7149b66c40f73644b8a3cc86444079d90a7c6d5df218893f70f4b7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 474–510.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Config : Type where
  /-- View the trace of the to_additive procedure.
  Equivalent to `set_option trace.to_additive true`. -/
  trace : Bool := false
  /-- The name of the target (the additive declaration). -/
  tgt : Name := Name.anonymous
  /-- An optional doc string. -/
  doc : Option String := none
  /-- If `allowAutoName` is `false` (default) then
  `@[to_additive]` will check whether the given name can be auto-generated. -/
  allowAutoName : Bool := false
  /-- The arguments that should be reordered by `to_additive`, using cycle notation. -/
  reorder : List (List Nat) := []
  /-- The attributes which we want to give to both the multiplicative and additive versions.
  For `simps` this will also add generated lemmas to the translation dictionary. -/
  attrs : Array Syntax := #[]
  /-- The `Syntax` element corresponding to the original multiplicative declaration
  (or the `to_additive` attribute if it is added later),
  which we need for adding definition ranges. -/
  ref : Syntax
  /-- An optional flag stating whether the additive declaration already exists.
    If this flag is set but wrong about whether the additive declaration exists, `to_additive` will
    raise a linter error.
    Note: the linter will never raise an error for inductive types and structures. -/
  existing : Option Bool := none
  deriving Repr

/-- Implementation function for `additiveTest`.
Failure means that in that subexpression there is no constant that blocks `e` from being translated.
We cache previous applications of the function, using an expression cache using ptr equality
to avoid visiting the same subexpression many times. Note that we only need to cache the
expressions without taking the value of `inApp` into account, since `inApp` only matters when
the expression is a constant. However, for this reason we have to make sure that we never
cache constant expressions, so that's why the `if`s in the implementation are in this order.

Note that this function is still called many times by `applyReplacementFun`
and we're not remembering the cache between these calls. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Variant069edb532fdb4833e6c83256f30f5ec3898bb973909c8ea7ad3005473a0c26de.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Variant069edb532fdb4833e6c83256f30f5ec3898bb973909c8ea7ad3005473a0c26de.lean#L474).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `68138ccfe54e8c7a4fe4d54f67af05cfcc444fe2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
