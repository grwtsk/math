## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fb07975e3bf69e9735e3a9f7984d092cdc23fca770c0da5b6a582c45f9174c52`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1021–1031.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def applyNameDict : List String → List String
  | x :: s => (capitalizeFirstLike x (nameDict x.toLower)) ++ applyNameDict s
  | [] => []

/--
There are a few abbreviations we use. For example "Nonneg" instead of "ZeroLE"
or "addComm" instead of "commAdd".
Note: The input to this function is case sensitive!
Todo: A lot of abbreviations here are manual fixes and there might be room to
      improve the naming logic to reduce the size of `fixAbbreviation`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Variant069edb532fdb4833e6c83256f30f5ec3898bb973909c8ea7ad3005473a0c26de.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Variant069edb532fdb4833e6c83256f30f5ec3898bb973909c8ea7ad3005473a0c26de.lean#L1021).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `68138ccfe54e8c7a4fe4d54f67af05cfcc444fe2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
