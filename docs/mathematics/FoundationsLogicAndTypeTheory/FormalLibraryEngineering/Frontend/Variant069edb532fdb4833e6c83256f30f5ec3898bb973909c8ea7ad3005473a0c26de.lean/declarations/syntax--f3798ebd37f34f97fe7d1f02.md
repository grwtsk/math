## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `syntax` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ac79fa9c2a99f9791b7db9cd597ca5f9536bd0ae0ae24681c8bc471ffbf1df4e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 65–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
syntax (name := to_additive_reorder) "to_additive_reorder " (num+),+ : attr

/-- An attribute that stores all the declarations that deal with numeric literals on variable types.

Numeral literals occur in expressions without type information, so in order to decide whether `1`
needs to be changed to `0`, the context around the numeral is relevant.
Most numerals will be in an `OfNat.ofNat` application, though tactics can add numeral literals
inside arbitrary functions. By default we assume that we do not change numerals, unless it is
in a function application with the `to_additive_change_numeral` attribute.

`@[to_additive_change_numeral n₁ ...]` should be added to all functions that take one or more
numerals as argument that should be changed if `additiveTest` succeeds on the first argument,
i.e. when the numeral is only translated if the first argument is a variable
(or consists of variables).
The arguments `n₁ ...` are the positions of the numeral arguments (starting counting from 1). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Variant069edb532fdb4833e6c83256f30f5ec3898bb973909c8ea7ad3005473a0c26de.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Variant069edb532fdb4833e6c83256f30f5ec3898bb973909c8ea7ad3005473a0c26de.lean#L65).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `68138ccfe54e8c7a4fe4d54f67af05cfcc444fe2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
