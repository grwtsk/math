## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b9c38ba8fe4274869a991ccba3498724a9435bc6b951d0de55e0191cfa4bc02a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 451–461.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def elabLinarithArg (tactic : Name) (t : Term) : TacticM Expr := Term.withoutErrToSorry do
  let (e, mvars) ← elabTermWithHoles t none tactic
  unless mvars.isEmpty do
    throwErrorAt t "Argument passed to {tactic} has metavariables:{indentD e}"
  return e

/--
Allow elaboration of `LinarithConfig` arguments to tactics.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Variant8d93d6c6576157fa6084c96c57792a2c12d35d360484b642206b239671876f72.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Variant8d93d6c6576157fa6084c96c57792a2c12d35d360484b642206b239671876f72.lean#L451).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c85d90d2356618bdac4bf82a55d26e05805b9e5e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
