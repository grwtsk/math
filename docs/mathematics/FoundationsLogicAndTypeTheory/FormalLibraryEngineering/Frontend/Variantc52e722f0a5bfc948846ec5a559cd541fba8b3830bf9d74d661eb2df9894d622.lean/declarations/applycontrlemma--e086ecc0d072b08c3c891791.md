## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:90616bdc29d10a5db94460a6db318071ffb1426c410e3f6785638382a62786e9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 218–227.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def applyContrLemma (g : MVarId) : MetaM (Option (Expr × Expr) × MVarId) := do
  try
    let (nm, tp) ← getContrLemma (← withReducible g.getType')
    let [g] ← g.apply (← mkConst' nm) | failure
    let (f, g) ← g.intro1P
    return (some (tp, .fvar f), g)
  catch _ => return (none, g)

/-- A map of keys to values, where the keys are `Expr` up to defeq and one key can be
associated to multiple values. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Variantc52e722f0a5bfc948846ec5a559cd541fba8b3830bf9d74d661eb2df9894d622.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Variantc52e722f0a5bfc948846ec5a559cd541fba8b3830bf9d74d661eb2df9894d622.lean#L218).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f8e1bbc1e6aca213e9e055714c74ebd3b16eeea4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
