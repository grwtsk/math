## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:366564e68ab1ae854fcbeb45bb890658dac1fd1d4d41cd7706d4c5d415d0ca42`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 59–75.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive LintVerbosity
  /-- `low`: only print failing checks, print nothing on success. -/
  | low
  /-- `medium`: only print failing checks, print confirmation on success. -/
  | medium
  /-- `high`: print output of every check. -/
  | high
  deriving Inhabited, DecidableEq, Repr

/-- `getChecks slow runOnly runAlways` produces a list of linters.
`runOnly` is an optional list of names that should resolve to declarations with type `NamedLinter`.
If populated, only these linters are run (regardless of the default configuration).
`runAlways` is an optional list of names that should resolve to declarations with type
`NamedLinter`. If populated, these linters are always run (regardless of their configuration).
Specifying a linter in `runAlways` but not `runOnly` is an error.
Otherwise, it uses all enabled linters in the environment tagged with `@[env_linter]`.
If `slow` is false, it only uses the fast default tests. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Varianta9fa9e3b6bf50d71bd8f3e50073d0c239d6146bc440431e8ed7bfde3e5d7ca97.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Varianta9fa9e3b6bf50d71bd8f3e50073d0c239d6146bc440431e8ed7bfde3e5d7ca97.lean#L59).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9d9fd3824554a343c4e6b96b13113b3c1ccc8611` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
