## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `macro` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:56496bd08f4b9d1a091629c84ee90f4ed4418b56c271f578e6476ce3f8e12dea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 327–337.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
macro "to_additive?" rest:toAdditiveRest : attr => `(attr| to_additive ? $rest)

/-- A set of strings of names that end in a capital letter.
* If the string contains a lowercase letter, the string should be split between the first occurrence
  of a lower-case letter followed by an upper-case letter.
* If multiple strings have the same prefix, they should be grouped by prefix
* In this case, the second list should be prefix-free
  (no element can be a prefix of a later element)

Todo: automate the translation from `String` to an element in this `TreeMap`
  (but this would require having something similar to the `rb_lmap` from Lean 3). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Variantdbe3a7516f598fd781a8df084fb932b6c2b19401bdcac8f13c377929f8caea2f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Variantdbe3a7516f598fd781a8df084fb932b6c2b19401bdcac8f13c377929f8caea2f.lean#L327).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b2935c698dfe72503e695031eab3ae2f71a0671a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
