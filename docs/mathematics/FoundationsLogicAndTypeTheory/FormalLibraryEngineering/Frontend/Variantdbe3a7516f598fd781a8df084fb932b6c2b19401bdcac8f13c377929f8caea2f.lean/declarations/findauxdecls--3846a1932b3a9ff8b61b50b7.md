## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2f35bbd5940796e0b3bd67153bfbba4a2b5a90177d4bf33f1f4772de6ee88f85`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 781–792.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def findAuxDecls (e : Expr) (pre : Name) : NameSet :=
  e.foldConsts ∅ fun n l ↦
    if n.getPrefix == pre || isPrivateName n || n.hasMacroScopes then
      l.insert n
    else
      l

/-- transform the declaration `src` and all declarations `pre._proof_i` occurring in `src`
using the transforms dictionary.
`replace_all`, `trace`, `ignore` and `reorder` are configuration options.
`pre` is the declaration that got the `@[to_additive]` attribute and `tgt_pre` is the target of this
declaration. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Variantdbe3a7516f598fd781a8df084fb932b6c2b19401bdcac8f13c377929f8caea2f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Frontend/Variantdbe3a7516f598fd781a8df084fb932b6c2b19401bdcac8f13c377929f8caea2f.lean#L781).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b2935c698dfe72503e695031eab3ae2f71a0671a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
