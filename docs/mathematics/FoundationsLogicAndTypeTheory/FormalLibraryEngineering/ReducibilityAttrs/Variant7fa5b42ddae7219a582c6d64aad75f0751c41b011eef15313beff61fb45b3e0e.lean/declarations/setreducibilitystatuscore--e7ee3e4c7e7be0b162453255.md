## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:26d99d6261f4a6c66fea2e85ec4163a5a10767efe2554fbdb971bbbdb2cc1aaa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
private def setReducibilityStatusCore (env : Environment) (declName : Name) (status : ReducibilityStatus) (attrKind : AttributeKind) (currNamespace : Name) : Environment :=
  if attrKind matches .global then
    match env.getModuleIdxFor? declName with
    | some _ =>
      -- Trying to set the attribute of a declaration defined in an imported module.
      reducibilityExtraExt.addEntry env (declName, status)
    | none =>
      let _ : Inhabited Environment := ⟨env⟩
      reducibilityCoreExt.addEntry (asyncDecl := declName) env (declName, status)
  else
    -- `scoped` and `local` must be handled by `reducibilityExtraExt`
    reducibilityExtraExt.addCore env (declName, status) attrKind currNamespace

TODO: it would be great if we could distinguish between the following two situations

1-
```
@[reducible] def foo := ...
```

2-
```
def foo := ...
...
attribute [reducible] foo
```

Reason: the second one is problematic if user has add simp theorems or TC instances that include `foo`.
Recall that the discrimination trees unfold `[reducible]` declarations while indexing new entries.

register_builtin_option allowUnsafeReducibility : Bool := {
  defValue := false
  descr    := "enables users to modify the reducibility settings for declarations even when such changes are deemed potentially hazardous. For example, `simp` and type class resolution maintain term indices where reducible declarations are expanded."
}

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ReducibilityAttrs/Variant7fa5b42ddae7219a582c6d64aad75f0751c41b011eef15313beff61fb45b3e0e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ReducibilityAttrs/Variant7fa5b42ddae7219a582c6d64aad75f0751c41b011eef15313beff61fb45b3e0e.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d32f8582486f0b4cba5334c29164194c2787c78d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
