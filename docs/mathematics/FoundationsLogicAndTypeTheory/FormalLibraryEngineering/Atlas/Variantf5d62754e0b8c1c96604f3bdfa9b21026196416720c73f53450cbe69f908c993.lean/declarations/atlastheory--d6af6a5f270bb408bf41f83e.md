## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:002a9d58962954e1940bd21970c5cc16e29cf605c36a3a296e2bc5156e49c713`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 32–44.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure AtlasTheory (Fact : Type z) [DecidableEq Fact] where
  /-- The fixed proposition represented by each finite fact identifier. -/
  meaning : Fact → Prop
  /-- The finite ground rules whose consequences may enter the atlas. -/
  rules : Finset (Rule Fact)
  rules_sound : ∀ rule ∈ rules,
    (∀ x ∈ rule.premises, meaning x) → meaning rule.conclusion

variable {V : Type v} {E : Type w} {Fact : Type z}
variable [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] [Fintype E] [DecidableEq E]
variable [Fintype Fact] [DecidableEq Fact]

/-- A trusted atlas selects checked bridges and an inventory of proved facts. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Atlas/Variantf5d62754e0b8c1c96604f3bdfa9b21026196416720c73f53450cbe69f908c993.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Atlas/Variantf5d62754e0b8c1c96604f3bdfa9b21026196416720c73f53450cbe69f908c993.lean#L32).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a1f36623963069de48ee616c31dc3d1f51e1f75` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
