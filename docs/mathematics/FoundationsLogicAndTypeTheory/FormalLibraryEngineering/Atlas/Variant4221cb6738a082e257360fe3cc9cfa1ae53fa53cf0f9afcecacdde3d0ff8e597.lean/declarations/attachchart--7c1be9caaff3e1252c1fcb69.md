## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b46f10e984fc7130efdebaabe799e820fb373f09b837779a83cef12011e59191`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 74–85.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def attachChart (atlas : FiniteAtlas catalog theory) (chart : PaperChart catalog theory) :
    FiniteAtlas catalog theory where
  selection := atlas.selection.union chart.selection
  facts := saturate theory.rules (atlas.facts ∪ chart.acceptedFacts)
  facts_sound := saturation_sound theory.rules (atlas.facts ∪ chart.acceptedFacts)
    theory.meaning (by
      intro x hx
      rcases Finset.mem_union.mp hx with ha | hc
      · exact atlas.facts_sound x ha
      · exact chart.accepted_sound x hc) theory.rules_sound

/-- Previously accepted facts remain accepted after attachment. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Atlas/Variant4221cb6738a082e257360fe3cc9cfa1ae53fa53cf0f9afcecacdde3d0ff8e597.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Atlas/Variant4221cb6738a082e257360fe3cc9cfa1ae53fa53cf0f9afcecacdde3d0ff8e597.lean#L74).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `04d5e83598109c7a7f874a54d4a786788b47384b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
