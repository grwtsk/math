## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f74ef1eafc922b40005ab3e8df07a3465db182405b7007355630d67264ecbb7f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 184–198.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
def removeDeprecations (fname : String) (rgs : Array Lean.Syntax.Range) : IO String :=
  return removeRanges (← IO.FS.readFile fname) rgs

/--
`parseLine line` assumes that the input string is of the form
```
info: File/Path.lean:12:0: [362, 398, 399]
```
and extracts `[362, 398, 399]`.
It makes the assumption that there is a unique `: [` substring and then retrieves the numbers.

Note that this is the output of `Mathlib.Linter.CommandRanges.commandRangesLinter`
that the script here is parsing.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FindDeprecations/Variant71155d79f364d513551484c2dd8982734a08cdf033478351e421d294a6fa9e4b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FindDeprecations/Variant71155d79f364d513551484c2dd8982734a08cdf033478351e421d294a6fa9e4b.lean#L184).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a919edf350e4c178bff0d205153e11355a32ab00` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
