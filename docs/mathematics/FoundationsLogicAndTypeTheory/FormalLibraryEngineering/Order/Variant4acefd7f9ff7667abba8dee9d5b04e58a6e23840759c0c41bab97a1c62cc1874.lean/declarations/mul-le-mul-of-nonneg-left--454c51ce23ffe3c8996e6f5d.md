## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cd7a4093-2e03-4ca3-c4b2-dc9f255517cc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 560–569.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left {a b c : Int}
    (h₁ : a ≤ b) (h₂ : 0 ≤ c) : c * a ≤ c * b :=
  if hba : b ≤ a then by
    rw [Int.le_antisymm hba h₁]; apply Int.le_refl
  else if hc0 : c ≤ 0 then by
    simp [Int.le_antisymm hc0 h₂, Int.zero_mul]
  else by
    exact Int.le_of_lt <| Int.mul_lt_mul_of_pos_left
      (Int.lt_iff_le_and_not_ge.2 ⟨h₁, hba⟩) (Int.lt_iff_le_and_not_ge.2 ⟨h₂, hc0⟩)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Order/Variant4acefd7f9ff7667abba8dee9d5b04e58a6e23840759c0c41bab97a1c62cc1874.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Order/Variant4acefd7f9ff7667abba8dee9d5b04e58a6e23840759c0c41bab97a1c62cc1874.lean#L560).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a85f97229f1cc38183471a18f15b4b1ce06cde48` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
