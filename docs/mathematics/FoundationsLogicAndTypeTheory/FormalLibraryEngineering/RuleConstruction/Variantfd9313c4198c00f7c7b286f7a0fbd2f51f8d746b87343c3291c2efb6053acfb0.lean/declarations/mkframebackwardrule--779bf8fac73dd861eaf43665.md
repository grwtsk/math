## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cfb4e091129a0ff4cb269782078b86835eea5fcdb7110bc193e9859f985e1fb9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 450–462.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public def mkFrameBackwardRule (op : Expr) (info : WPApp) : MetaM BackwardRule := do
  -- Pin the monad and the operator, leaving the frame `F`, program, and postconditions schematic;
  -- `tryMkBackwardRuleFromSpec` turns them into rule parameters and `hoistFrameVar` surfaces `F`.
  let specProof ← mkAppOptM ``Std.Internal.Do.WP.Frames.op_wp_upperAdjoint_le_wp
    ((info.args.take 7).map some ++ #[none, some op, none])
  let some specThm ← mkSpecTheoremFromStx (← getRef) specProof
    | throwError "frame: could not build the upper-adjoint frame spec for operator{indentExpr op}"
  let some rule ← (tryMkBackwardRuleFromSpec specThm info).run
    | throwError "frame: could not build the frame rule for operator{indentExpr op}"
  hoistFrameVar rule

end VCGen
end Lean.Elab.Tactic.Do.Internal
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RuleConstruction/Variantfd9313c4198c00f7c7b286f7a0fbd2f51f8d746b87343c3291c2efb6053acfb0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RuleConstruction/Variantfd9313c4198c00f7c7b286f7a0fbd2f51f8d746b87343c3291c2efb6053acfb0.lean#L450).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e39485b4727669e40b2752d74a633be14945f721` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
