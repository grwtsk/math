## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b6e4f2adcfe21c02d0dd94073a7360c7f59777f287f504eb7260067d0eaa1896`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 30–40.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def unfoldThmType (declName : Name) : MetaM Expr := do
  if let some unfoldThm ← getUnfoldEqnFor? declName (nonRec := false) then
    let info ← getConstInfo unfoldThm
    pure info.type
  else
    let info ← getConstInfoDefn declName
    let us := info.levelParams.map mkLevelParam
    lambdaTelescope (cleanupAnnotations := true) info.value fun xs body => do
      let type ← mkEq (mkAppN (Lean.mkConst declName us) xs) body
      mkForallFVars xs type

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Eqns/Variant59644308b84ec8c1c6b8886b3524e239cc8a97aa6210feb6046b90eb126e1ee6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Eqns/Variant59644308b84ec8c1c6b8886b3524e239cc8a97aa6210feb6046b90eb126e1ee6.lean#L30).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7a2507e3b5079fdac4a97cedbb2629942a736fbe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
