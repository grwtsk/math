## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:766a8e809327d8c902992c729dc316b1ee6c2b08f759b8cf1d44f78d37418f78`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 111–138.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private partial def splitIfsCore
    (loc : Location)
    (hNames : IO.Ref (List (TSyntax `Lean.binderIdent))) :
    List Expr → TacticM Unit := fun done ↦ withMainContext do
  let some (_,cond) ← findIfCondAt loc
      | Meta.throwTacticEx `split_ifs (←getMainGoal) "no if-then-else conditions to split"

  -- If `cond` is `¬p` then use `p` instead.
  let cond := if cond.isAppOf `Not then cond.getAppArgs[0]! else cond

  if done.contains cond then return ()
  let no_split ← valueKnown cond
  if no_split then
    andThenOnSubgoals (reduceIfsAt loc) (splitIfsCore loc hNames (cond::done) <|> pure ())
  else do
    let hName ← getNextName hNames
    andThenOnSubgoals (splitIf1 cond hName loc) ((splitIfsCore loc hNames (cond::done)) <|>
      pure ())

/-- Splits all if-then-else-expressions into multiple goals.
Given a goal of the form `g (if p then x else y)`, `split_ifs` will produce
two goals: `p ⊢ g x` and `¬p ⊢ g y`.
If there are multiple ite-expressions, then `split_ifs` will split them all,
starting with a top-most one whose condition does not contain another
ite-expression.
`split_ifs at *` splits all ite-expressions in all hypotheses as well as the goal.
`split_ifs with h₁ h₂ h₃` overrides the default names for the hypotheses.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SplitIfs/Variantf6098cb76d8f03461ae5a2c65402812195b579f40f937189b3fa02582d8a5f66.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SplitIfs/Variantf6098cb76d8f03461ae5a2c65402812195b579f40f937189b3fa02582d8a5f66.lean#L111).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8c54431fbec8350ae3e465d6c1288e141ee8934d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
