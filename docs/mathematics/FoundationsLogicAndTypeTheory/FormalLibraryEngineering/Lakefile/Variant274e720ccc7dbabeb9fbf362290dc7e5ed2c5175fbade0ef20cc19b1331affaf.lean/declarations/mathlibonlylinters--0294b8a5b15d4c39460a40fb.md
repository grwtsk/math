## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:61c38874e19bb0cebee4b3bbd4daaba021cd7d77da2954599c7202a7e9bf0f26`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 28–42.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev mathlibOnlyLinters : Array LeanOption := #[
  ⟨`linter.mathlibStandardSet, true⟩,
  -- Explicitly enable the header linter, since the standard set is defined in `Mathlib.Init`
  -- but we want to run this linter in files imported by `Mathlib.Init`.
  ⟨`linter.style.header, true⟩,
  ⟨`linter.checkInitImports, true⟩,
  ⟨`linter.allScriptsDocumented, true⟩,
  ⟨`linter.pythonStyle, true⟩,
  ⟨`linter.style.longFile, .ofNat 1500⟩,
  -- ⟨`linter.nightlyRegressionSet, true⟩,
  -- `latest_import.yml` uses this comment: if you edit it, make sure that the workflow still works
]

/-- These options are passed as `leanOptions` to building mathlib, as well as the
`Archive` and `Counterexamples`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Lakefile/Variant274e720ccc7dbabeb9fbf362290dc7e5ed2c5175fbade0ef20cc19b1331affaf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Lakefile/Variant274e720ccc7dbabeb9fbf362290dc7e5ed2c5175fbade0ef20cc19b1331affaf.lean#L28).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6fcf25bc966618668c5690c79cf6e10a2c5635f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
