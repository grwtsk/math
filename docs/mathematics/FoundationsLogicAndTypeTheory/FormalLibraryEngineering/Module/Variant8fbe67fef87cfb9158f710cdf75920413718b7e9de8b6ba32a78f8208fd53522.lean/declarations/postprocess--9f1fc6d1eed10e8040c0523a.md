## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cd5842f14afce5f9b94a993ab457954e84c373a429edef7e07fae358d512902f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 612–620.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def postprocess (mvarId : MVarId) : MetaM MVarId := do
  -- run `simp` with these lemmas, and (importantly) *no* simprocs
  let (some r, _) ← simpTarget mvarId (← postprocessCtx) (simprocs := #[]) |
    throwError "internal error in match_scalars tactic: postprocessing should not close goals"
  return r

/-- Given a goal which is an equality in a type `M` (with `M` an `AddCommMonoid`), parse the LHS and
RHS of the goal as linear combinations of `M`-atoms over some semiring `R`, and reduce the goal to
the respective equalities of the `R`-coefficients of each atom. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Module/Variant8fbe67fef87cfb9158f710cdf75920413718b7e9de8b6ba32a78f8208fd53522.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Module/Variant8fbe67fef87cfb9158f710cdf75920413718b7e9de8b6ba32a78f8208fd53522.lean#L612).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a0bfd2ee6a0415b489d32e3c39c7794614bcd26` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
