## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:17c8bceb-9f92-fc55-1007-4a23c994b9ea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 231–258.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

variable {u v : Level}

/-! ### Lists of expressions representing scalars and vectors, and operations on such lists -/

/-- Basic meta-code "normal form" object of the `match_scalars` and `module` tactics: a type synonym
for a list of ordered triples comprising expressions representing terms of two types `R` and `M`
(where typically `M` is an `R`-module), together with a natural number "index".

The natural number represents the index of the `M` term in the `AtomM` monad: this is not enforced,
but is sometimes assumed in operations.  Thus when items `((a₁, x₁), k)` and `((a₂, x₂), k)`
appear in two different `Module.qNF` objects (i.e. with the same `ℕ`-index `k`), it is expected that
the expressions `x₁` and `x₂` are the same.  It is also expected that the items in a `Module.qNF`
list are in strictly increasing order by natural-number index.

By forgetting the natural number indices, an expression representing a `Mathlib.Tactic.Module.NF`
object can be built from a `Module.qNF` object; this construction is provided as
`Mathlib.Tactic.Module.qNF.toNF`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Module/Variant8fbe67fef87cfb9158f710cdf75920413718b7e9de8b6ba32a78f8208fd53522.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Module/Variant8fbe67fef87cfb9158f710cdf75920413718b7e9de8b6ba32a78f8208fd53522.lean#L231).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
