## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:425c133f-e146-2089-676c-de275873a08d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 148–154.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sub_eq_eval₃ [Ring R] [AddCommGroup M] [Module R M] {a₁ : R × M} (a₂ : R × M)
    {l₁ l₂ l : NF R M} (h : (a₁ ::ᵣ l₁).eval - l₂.eval = l.eval) :
    (a₁ ::ᵣ l₁).eval - (a₂ ::ᵣ l₂).eval = ((-a₂.1, a₂.2) ::ᵣ l).eval := by
  simp only [eval_cons, neg_smul, neg_add, sub_eq_add_neg, ← h, ← add_assoc]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Module/Variant85065c794586f1d3c50a936544c02d7ab62df2fc89806a591afd12b838822590.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Module/Variant85065c794586f1d3c50a936544c02d7ab62df2fc89806a591afd12b838822590.lean#L148).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4cf76646a476458159968607aa90e48ef58ed52b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
