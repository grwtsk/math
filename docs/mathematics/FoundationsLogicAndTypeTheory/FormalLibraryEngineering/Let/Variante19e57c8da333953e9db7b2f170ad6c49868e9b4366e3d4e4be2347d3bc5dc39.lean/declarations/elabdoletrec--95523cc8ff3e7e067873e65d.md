## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:141830f7b2394dc5cf4ba76cbaf6d382d3aa4ce2389c977fdc7999c3c56755bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 216–226.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[builtin_doElem_elab Lean.Parser.Term.doLetRec] def elabDoLetRec : DoElab := fun stx dec => do
  let `(doLetRec| let%$tk rec $decls:letRecDecls) := stx | throwUnsupportedSyntax
  let dec ← dec.ensureUnitAt tk
  let vars ← getLetRecDeclsVars decls
  let mγ ← mkMonadApp (← read).doBlockResultType
  doElabToSyntax m!"let rec body of group {vars}" dec.continueWithUnit fun body => do
    -- Let recs may never have nested actions. We expand just for the sake of error messages.
    -- This suppresses error messages for the let body. Not sure if this is a good call, but it was
    -- the status quo of the legacy `do` elaborator.
    Term.elabTerm (← `(let rec $decls:letRecDecls; $body)) mγ

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Let/Variante19e57c8da333953e9db7b2f170ad6c49868e9b4366e3d4e4be2347d3bc5dc39.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Let/Variante19e57c8da333953e9db7b2f170ad6c49868e9b4366e3d4e4be2347d3bc5dc39.lean#L216).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `25c53116c1ba748743253f8a5568092c1708ab83` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
