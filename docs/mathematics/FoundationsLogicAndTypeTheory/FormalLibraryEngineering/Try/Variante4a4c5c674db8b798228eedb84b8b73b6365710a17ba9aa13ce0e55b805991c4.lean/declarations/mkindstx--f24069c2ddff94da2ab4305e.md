## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d6d9a5431e8c569d880805bcae784cc3ab260cafd23744e1fc28212d17af9605`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1005–1019.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def mkIndStx (cand : InductionCandidate) (cont : TSyntax `tactic) :
    MetaM (TSyntax `tactic) := do
  let fvar := mkFVar cand.fvarId
  let isAccessible ← isExprAccessible fvar
  withExposedNames do
    let stx ← PrettyPrinter.delab fvar
    let tac₁ ← `(tactic| induction $stx:term <;> $cont)
    -- if fvar has no inaccessible names, use as is
    if isAccessible then
      pure tac₁
    else
      -- if it has inaccessible names, still try without, in case they are all implicit
      let tac₂ ← `(tactic| (expose_names; $tac₁))
      mkFirstStx #[tac₁, tac₂]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Try/Variante4a4c5c674db8b798228eedb84b8b73b6365710a17ba9aa13ce0e55b805991c4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Try/Variante4a4c5c674db8b798228eedb84b8b73b6365710a17ba9aa13ce0e55b805991c4.lean#L1005).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7d5de50f96ef6c968206149dcfb89e64150fe400` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
