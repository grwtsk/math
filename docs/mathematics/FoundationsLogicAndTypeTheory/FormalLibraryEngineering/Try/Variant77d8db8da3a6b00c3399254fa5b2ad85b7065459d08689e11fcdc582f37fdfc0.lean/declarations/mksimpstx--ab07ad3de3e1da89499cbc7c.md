## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b7dc4ee9ecbe9cfa00ed92e4e608f7c0ba2414f9702e47729e892887f66a1b87`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 963–972.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def mkSimpStx : CoreM (TSyntax `tactic) :=
  `(tactic| first | simp? | simp? [*] | simp? +arith | simp? +arith [*])

set_option hygiene false in -- Avoid tagger at `+suggestions`
/--
Atomic tactics with library suggestions.

Note: We previously included `simp_all? +suggestions` here, but removed it due to performance issues.
We would like to restore it in the future once `simp_all? +suggestions` is faster for general use.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Try/Variant77d8db8da3a6b00c3399254fa5b2ad85b7065459d08689e11fcdc582f37fdfc0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Try/Variant77d8db8da3a6b00c3399254fa5b2ad85b7065459d08689e11fcdc582f37fdfc0.lean#L963).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3b3ac56b63926d119ef338d7fa391b161184285b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
