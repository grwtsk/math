## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:14c157557409f7a0b16dc9ae6e9c41598a2722479a914d8fdbe7c754cef6a53e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 731–754.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private partial def evalSuggestAttemptAll (tacs : Array (TSyntax ``Parser.Tactic.tacticSeq)) : TryTacticM (TSyntax `tactic) := do
  unless (← read).terminal do
    throwError "invalid occurrence of `attempt_all` in non-terminal position for `try?` script{indentD (← read).root}"
  go 0 none #[]
where
  go (i : Nat) (saved? : Option SavedState) (acc : Array (TSyntax `tactic)) : TryTacticM (TSyntax `tactic) := do
    -- Remark: we considered using `acc.size < (← read).config.max` here to truncate the search,
    -- but it had a negative effect when using `<;>`. We could miss a preferred solution `induction e <;> grind`
    -- because only a subset of the goals were solved by simpler tactics such as `rfl` and `simp`.
    if i < tacs.size then
      match (← observing (evalSuggestTacticSeq tacs[i]!)) with
      | .ok tac s =>
        trace[try.debug] "`attempt_all` argument succeeded{indentD tac}"
        go (i+1) (saved? <|> some s) (appendSuggestion acc tac)
      | _ =>
        go (i+1) saved? acc
    else
      if let some saved := saved? then
        saved.restore
        mkTrySuggestions acc
      else
        throwError "`attempt_all` failed"

/-- `evalSuggest` for `attempt_all_par` tactic (parallel version). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Try/Variant77d8db8da3a6b00c3399254fa5b2ad85b7065459d08689e11fcdc582f37fdfc0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Try/Variant77d8db8da3a6b00c3399254fa5b2ad85b7065459d08689e11fcdc582f37fdfc0.lean#L731).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3b3ac56b63926d119ef338d7fa391b161184285b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
