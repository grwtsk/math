## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ddd4fe22f01e8245b58b28c67a6177cf748105c2bfd1edf15c693e954759f6b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 123–134.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class LawfulAlternativeLift (m : semiOutParam (Type u → Type v)) (n : Type u → Type w)
    [Alternative m] [Alternative n] [MonadLift m n] : Prop where
  /-- Lifting preserves `failure`. -/
  monadLift_failure : monadLift (failure : m α) = (failure : n α)
  /-- Lifting preserves `orElse`. -/
  monadLift_orElse (x y : m α) : monadLift (x <|> y) = (monadLift x <|> monadLift y : n α)

export LawfulAlternativeLift (monadLift_failure monadLift_orElse)
attribute [simp] monadLift_failure monadLift_orElse

namespace Option

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/AlternativeMonad/Variantd54dca846cf752bc4f3595c77005b5f32f07554e204777863ff0af0c2dad56fb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/AlternativeMonad/Variantd54dca846cf752bc4f3595c77005b5f32f07554e204777863ff0af0c2dad56fb.lean#L123).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9dfe9e79059d31c1ef68e3f2f21b033267bc66d3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
