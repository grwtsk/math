## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9818837b2a05b7d960460e9987ab5a94338b787cbec8276233f69218d9747561`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 24–36.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Result (α : Type) where
  /-- `filtered` will be shown in the filtered view. -/
  filtered : Option Html
  /-- `unfiltered` will be shown in the unfiltered view. -/
  unfiltered : Html
  /-- `key` is used for sorting and comparing theorems. -/
  key : α
  /-- The `pattern` of the first lemma in a section is shown as the header of that section. -/
  pattern : Html

variable {α : Type} [Ord α] [Inhabited α]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SectionState/Variant1cbaec019352ac816b896f143d767ad11bc7579cb8dc2dafddbccb2e2fc893cb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SectionState/Variant1cbaec019352ac816b896f143d767ad11bc7579cb8dc2dafddbccb2e2fc893cb.lean#L24).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1dd1f3752b4b2218ad3f92f8998b3cb6c5040ff9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
