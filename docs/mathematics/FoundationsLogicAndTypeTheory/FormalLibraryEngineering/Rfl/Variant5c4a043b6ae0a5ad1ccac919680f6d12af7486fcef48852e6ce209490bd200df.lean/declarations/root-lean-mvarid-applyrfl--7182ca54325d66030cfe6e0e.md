## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bf85d359ce4f208ea6340c1f7a56560f8fee0e3aadae4df6ffb508061d10c495`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–76.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def _root_.Lean.MVarId.applyRfl (goal : MVarId) : MetaM Unit := do
  let .app (.app rel _) _ ← whnfR <|← instantiateMVars <|← goal.getType
    | throwError "reflexivity lemmas only apply to binary relations, not{
        indentExpr (← goal.getType)}"
  let s ← saveState
  let mut ex? := none
  for lem in ← (reflExt.getState (← getEnv)).getMatch rel reflExt.config do
    try
      let gs ← goal.apply (← mkConstWithFreshMVarLevels lem)
      if gs.isEmpty then return () else
        logError <| MessageData.tagged `Tactic.unsolvedGoals <| m!"unsolved goals\n{
          goalsToMessageData gs}"
    catch e =>
      ex? := ex? <|> (some (← saveState, e)) -- stash the first failure of `apply`
    s.restore
  if let some (sErr, e) := ex? then
    sErr.restore
    throw e
  else
    throwError "rfl failed, no lemma with @[refl] applies"

/--
This tactic applies to a goal whose target has the form `x ~ x`, where `~` is a reflexive
relation, that is, a relation which has a reflexive lemma tagged with the attribute [refl].

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Rfl/Variant5c4a043b6ae0a5ad1ccac919680f6d12af7486fcef48852e6ce209490bd200df.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Rfl/Variant5c4a043b6ae0a5ad1ccac919680f6d12af7486fcef48852e6ce209490bd200df.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4675f3c6e0efb33b695afe708f5ebcc7572f6c72` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
