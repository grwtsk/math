## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7b18e05f-8c74-20a2-4eca-f74534551f5c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 236–256.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    have hpt := hp t (by simp)
    have hnt := hn t (by simp)
    have hc := L.choices_formula ts (fun s hs => hm s (by simp [hs])) (fun s hs => hp s (by
      simp [hs]))
    have hi := ih (fun s hs => hm s (by simp [hs])) (fun s hs => hp s (by simp [hs]))
      (fun s hs => hn s (by simp [hs]))
    apply L.equivalent_of_iff (L.choices_formula (t::ts) hm hp) L.bottom_formula
    change Proves P Γ γ (L.iff (L.disj (L.conj (mark t) (property t)) (L.code.choices ts mark
      property)) L.bottom)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Specialization/Variant735f0722a5fe36a81ed2c368585e987571c6fb8ceb4f0322535ce6fa267c92ef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Specialization/Variant735f0722a5fe36a81ed2c368585e987571c6fb8ceb4f0322535ce6fa267c92ef.lean#L236).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b5f21e36507710d4ab09326615af7cc30053d552` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
