## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6fe0a0d87dde2395094e599e05213785ee15a94ce4e44e014892ac679cecf388`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 119–160.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
public def IterM.flatMapM {α : Type w} {β : Type w} {α₂ : Type w}
    {γ : Type w} {m : Type w → Type w'} [Monad m] [MonadAttach m] [Iterator α m β] [Iterator α₂ m γ]
    (f : β → m (IterM (α := α₂) m γ)) (it : IterM (α := α) m β) :=
  (it.flatMapAfterM f none : IterM m γ)

/--
Let `it₁` and `it₂` be iterators and `f` a function mapping `it₁`'s outputs to iterators
of the same type as `it₂`. Then `it₁.flatMapAfter f it₂` first goes over `it₂` and then over
`it₁.flatMap f it₂`, emitting all their values.

The main purpose of this combinator is to represent the intermediate state of a `flatMap` iterator
that is currently iterating over one of the inner iterators.

**Marble diagram:**

```text
it₁                            --b      c    --d -⊥
it₂                      a1-a2⊥
f b                               b1-b2⊥
f c                                      c1-c2⊥
f d                                             ⊥
it.flatMapAfter  f it₂   a1-a2----b1-b2--c1-c2----⊥
```

**Termination properties:**

* `Finite` instance: only if `it₁`, `it₂` and the inner iterators are finite
* `Productive` instance: only if `it₁` is finite and `it₂` and the inner iterators are productive

For certain functions `f`, the resulting iterator will be finite (or productive) even though
no `Finite` (or `Productive`) instance is provided out of the box. For example, if the outer
iterator is productive and the inner
iterators are productive *and provably never empty*, then the resulting iterator is also productive.

**Performance:**

This combinator incurs an additional O(1) cost with each output of `it₁`, `it₂` or an internal
iterator.

For each value emitted by the outer iterator `it₁`, this combinator calls `f`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FlatMap/Variant70b92bfb0815417b01c1eb7e6b43b058d17281be4d903c0aee0756e1feb39d91.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FlatMap/Variant70b92bfb0815417b01c1eb7e6b43b058d17281be4d903c0aee0756e1feb39d91.lean#L119).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
