## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b8c4a43efc5d6af6bb4502ef75cabe9f4a7cbdb885c2ef9fdc331e9c9613dc67`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1731–1739.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure PersistentEnvExtensionDescr (α β σ : Type) extends PersistentEnvExtensionDescrCore α β σ where
  -- The cyclic default values force the user to specify at least one of the two following fields.
  /--
  Obsolete simpler version of `exportEntriesFnEx` that returns the same entries for all levels.
  Its value is ignored if the latter is also specified.
  -/
  exportEntriesFn : σ → Array α := useDefaultIfOtherFieldGiven (fun _ => #[]) exportEntriesFnEx
  exportEntriesFnEx := fun _ s => .uniform (exportEntriesFn s)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Environment/Variantee364e4788ce0560c87f621eeb3c4c3dfec62e8db4e15e099fd80e6adc533b86.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Environment/Variantee364e4788ce0560c87f621eeb3c4c3dfec62e8db4e15e099fd80e6adc533b86.lean#L1731).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `33928512dadcfa2e42a307499e9228596da0341a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
