## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `constants` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fc5fe83b4d1655a80dbb71f4648e678d420d4699ff048e672d60611e59b47b75`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 218–259.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
  constants   : ConstMap
  /--
  `quotInit = true` if the command `init_quot` has already been executed for the environment, and
  `Quot` declarations have been added to the environment. When the flag is set, the type checker can
  assume that the `Quot` declarations in the environment have indeed been added by the kernel and
  not by the user.
  -/
  quotInit    : Bool := false
  /--
  Diagnostic information collected during kernel execution.

  Remark: We store kernel diagnostic information in an environment field to simplify the interface
  with the kernel implemented in C/C++. Thus, we can only track declarations in methods, such as
  `addDecl`, which return a new environment. `Kernel.isDefEq` and `Kernel.whnf` do not update the
  statistics. We claim this is ok since these methods are mainly used for debugging.
  -/
  diagnostics : Diagnostics := {}
  /--
  Mapping from constant name to module (index) where constant has been declared.
  Recall that a Lean file has a header where previously compiled modules can be imported.
  Each imported module has a unique `ModuleIdx`.
  Many extensions use the `ModuleIdx` to efficiently retrieve information stored in imported modules.

  Remark: this mapping also contains auxiliary constants, created by the code generator, that are **not** in
  the field `constants`. These auxiliary constants are invisible to the Lean kernel and elaborator.
  Only the code generator uses them.
  -/
  const2ModIdx            : Std.HashMap Name ModuleIdx
  /--
  Environment extensions. It also includes user-defined extensions.
  -/
  private extensions      : Array EnvExtensionState
  /--
  Additional imported environment extension state for the interpreter. Access via
  `getModuleIREntries`.
  -/
  private irBaseExts      : Array EnvExtensionState
  /-- The header contains additional information that is set at import time. -/
  header                  : EnvironmentHeader := private_decl% {}
deriving Nonempty

/-- Exceptions that can be raised by the kernel when type checking new declarations. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Environment/Variantee364e4788ce0560c87f621eeb3c4c3dfec62e8db4e15e099fd80e6adc533b86.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Environment/Variantee364e4788ce0560c87f621eeb3c4c3dfec62e8db4e15e099fd80e6adc533b86.lean#L218).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `33928512dadcfa2e42a307499e9228596da0341a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
