## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:df3e04911b86871661e3f0c9dc2f9bd72d3f5e4a127d3ad483de7d60c5b5334d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 428–438.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[builtin_term_elab typeAscription] def elabTypeAscription : TermElab
  | `(($e : $type)), _ => do
    let type ← withSynthesize (postpone := .yes) <| elabType type
    let e ← elabTerm e type
    ensureHasType type e
  | `(($e :)), expectedType? => do
    let e ← withSynthesize (postpone := .no) <| elabTerm e none
    ensureHasType expectedType? e
  | _, _ => throwUnsupportedSyntax

/-- Return `true` if `lhs` is a free variable and `rhs` does not depend on it. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/BuiltinNotation/Variant64e5a3bdac228a280e1fe54d0baa3d8aff0aa9160f423aad6ea448cea2b96215.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/BuiltinNotation/Variant64e5a3bdac228a280e1fe54d0baa3d8aff0aa9160f423aad6ea448cea2b96215.lean#L428).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93ccf3f0a584d0877fb3442500c1b7e37083fe83` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
