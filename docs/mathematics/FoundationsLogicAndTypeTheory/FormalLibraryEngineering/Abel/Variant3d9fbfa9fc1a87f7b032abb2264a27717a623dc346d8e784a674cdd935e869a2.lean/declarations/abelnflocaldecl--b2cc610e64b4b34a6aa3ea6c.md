## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:20affed520a7256cde0665098b05916d3e549afd507b63e2db40746b563ff44a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 486–495.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def abelNFLocalDecl (s : IO.Ref AtomM.State) (cfg : AbelNF.Config) (fvarId : FVarId) :
    TacticM Unit := withMainContext do
  let tgt ← instantiateMVars (← fvarId.getType)
  let goal ← getMainGoal
  let myres ← abelNFCore s cfg tgt
  match ← applySimpResultToLocalDecl goal fvarId myres false with
  | none => replaceMainGoal []
  | some (_, newGoal) => replaceMainGoal [newGoal]

/-- Unsupported legacy syntax from mathlib3, which allowed passing additional terms to `abel`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Abel/Variant3d9fbfa9fc1a87f7b032abb2264a27717a623dc346d8e784a674cdd935e869a2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Abel/Variant3d9fbfa9fc1a87f7b032abb2264a27717a623dc346d8e784a674cdd935e869a2.lean#L486).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `937cb3bbb356759b749c89ee242f247057484444` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
