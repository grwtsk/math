## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2da34bc4090fae26558ee8d0a740de8e22c90835b8b1e9586fba167474b5f828`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 576–586.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkVarDeclCore (xs : Array Var) (stx : Syntax) (c : CodeBlock) : CodeBlock := {
  code := Code.decl xs stx c.code,
  uvars := eraseVars c.uvars xs
}

/--
Extending code blocks with reassignments: `x : t := v` and `x : t ← v`.
Remark: `stx` is the syntax for the declaration (e.g., `letDecl`), and `xs` are the variables
declared by it. It is an array because we have let-declarations that declare multiple variables.
Example: `(x, y) ← t`
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Legacy/Variantbae1a4a72d5249cb41d801ff1fc6b7f879a3ec4918ce84053e460ea9c0988250.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Legacy/Variantbae1a4a72d5249cb41d801ff1fc6b7f879a3ec4918ce84053e460ea9c0988250.lean#L576).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8c8da9f50ee7a399431280e0ec5e9dd066fa0789` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
