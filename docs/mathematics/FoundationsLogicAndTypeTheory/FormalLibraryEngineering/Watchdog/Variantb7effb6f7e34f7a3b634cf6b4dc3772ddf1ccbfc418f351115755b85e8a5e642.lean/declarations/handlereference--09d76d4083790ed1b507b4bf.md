## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d8f0e9a64dcf1d50dbec15dffeac635691b55d43bfd7a5c5b0f449ea3d5ce89f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 958–973.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

def handleReference (p : ReferenceParams) : ReaderT ReferenceRequestContext IO (Array Location) := do
  let fileWorkerMods := (← read).fileWorkerMods
  let some module := fileWorkerMods.get? p.textDocument.uri
    | return #[]
  let references := (← read).references
  let mut result := #[]
  for ident in references.findAt module p.position (includeStop := true) do
    let identRefs := references.referringTo ident
      p.context.includeDeclaration
    result := result.append <| identRefs.map (·.location)
  return result

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Watchdog/Variantb7effb6f7e34f7a3b634cf6b4dc3772ddf1ccbfc418f351115755b85e8a5e642.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Watchdog/Variantb7effb6f7e34f7a3b634cf6b4dc3772ddf1ccbfc418f351115755b85e8a5e642.lean#L958).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dedb28154c483633b49a12d1689938209c1531c4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
