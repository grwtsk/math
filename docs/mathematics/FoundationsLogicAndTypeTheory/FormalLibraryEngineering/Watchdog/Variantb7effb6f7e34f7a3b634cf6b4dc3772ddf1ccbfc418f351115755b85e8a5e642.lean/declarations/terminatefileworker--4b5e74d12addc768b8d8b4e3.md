## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9bf944c0011bff46a02f9d6a5d5cf455f1482e3c4862bbc75c54b2fa93216b92`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 895–914.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
  def terminateFileWorker (uri : DocumentUri) : ServerM Unit := do
    let some fw ← getFileWorker? uri
      | return
    setWorkerState fw .terminating
    eraseFileWorker uri
    try
      errorPendingRequests uri ErrorCode.contentModified
        s!"The file worker for {uri} has been terminated."
      -- Clear the diagnostics for this file so that stale errors
      -- do not remain in the editor forever.
      writeMessage <| mkPublishDiagnosticsNotification fw.doc #[]
    catch _ =>
      -- Client closed stdout => Still ensure that file worker is terminated
      pure ()
    try
      fw.stdin.writeLspMessage (Message.notification "exit" none)
    catch _ =>
      -- File worker crashed during termination => Treat it as terminated
      pure ()

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Watchdog/Variantb7effb6f7e34f7a3b634cf6b4dc3772ddf1ccbfc418f351115755b85e8a5e642.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Watchdog/Variantb7effb6f7e34f7a3b634cf6b4dc3772ddf1ccbfc418f351115755b85e8a5e642.lean#L895).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dedb28154c483633b49a12d1689938209c1531c4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
