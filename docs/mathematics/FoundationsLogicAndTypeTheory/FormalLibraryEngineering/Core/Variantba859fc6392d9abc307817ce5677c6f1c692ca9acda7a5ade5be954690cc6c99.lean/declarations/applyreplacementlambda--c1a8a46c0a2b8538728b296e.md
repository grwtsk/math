## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:74eec5ce2129cc89527a437d83420a1a6a16a382bfdd48a078433ec4152b587e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 616–632.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def applyReplacementLambda (t : TranslateData) (dontTranslate : List Nat) (e : Expr) :
    MetaM (Expr × Option RelevantArg) :=
  withTraceNode `translate_detail (fun _ =>
    return m!"translating the value {e}") do
  lambdaTelescope e fun xs e => do
    let xs := xs.map (·.fvarId!)
    let dontTranslate := dontTranslate.filterMap (xs[·]?) |>.toArray
    let (e, relevantArg?) ← ReplacementM.run dontTranslate xs do
      let mut e ← applyReplacementFun t e
      for x in xs.reverse do
        let decl ← x.getDecl
        let xType ← applyReplacementFun t decl.type
        e := .lam decl.userName xType (e.abstract #[.fvar x]) decl.binderInfo
      return e
    return (e, relevantArg?.map .arg)

/-- Run `applyReplacementFun` on the given `srcDecl` to make a new declaration with name `tgt`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variantba859fc6392d9abc307817ce5677c6f1c692ca9acda7a5ade5be954690cc6c99.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variantba859fc6392d9abc307817ce5677c6f1c692ca9acda7a5ade5be954690cc6c99.lean#L616).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `85e7fb128cfe562b177613129615fa16e03e7b10` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
