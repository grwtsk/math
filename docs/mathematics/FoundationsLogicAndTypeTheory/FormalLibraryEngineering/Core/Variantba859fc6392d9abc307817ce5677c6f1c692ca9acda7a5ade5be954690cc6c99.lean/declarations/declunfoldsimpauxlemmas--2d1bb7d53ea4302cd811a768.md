## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:44478170d0468f8c845b87209ab7bb912f5dc89f0f62125d6e1c8622240fd97a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 706–717.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def declUnfoldSimpAuxLemmas (decl : ConstantInfo) : MetaM ConstantInfo := do
  let unfold (e : Expr) := deltaExpand e (allowOpaque := true) fun
    | .str _ s => "_simp_".isPrefixOf s || "_gcongr_".isPrefixOf s ||
        isHCongrReservedNameSuffix s || s == congrSimpSuffix
    | _ => false
  let mut decl := decl
  decl := decl.updateType <| ← unfold decl.type
  if let some v := decl.value? (allowOpaque := true) then
    decl := decl.updateValue <| ← unfold v
  return decl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variantba859fc6392d9abc307817ce5677c6f1c692ca9acda7a5ade5be954690cc6c99.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variantba859fc6392d9abc307817ce5677c6f1c692ca9acda7a5ade5be954690cc6c99.lean#L706).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `85e7fb128cfe562b177613129615fa16e03e7b10` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
