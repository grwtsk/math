## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:db24577080c0e3d186010e96d35cd9364a8f4096ce27996d108f3ac43e6e880a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 614–624.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def relImpRelLemma (arity : Nat) : List GCongrLemma :=
  if arity < 2 then [] else [{
    declName := ``rel_imp_rel
    mainSubgoals := #[⟨5, 3, 7, [], true⟩, ⟨4, 6, 8, [], false⟩]
    numHyps := 9
    keys := default, prio := default, numVarying := default, forGrw := true
  }]

end Trans

/-- The state used by `GCongrM`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variantd9a9e8dba619d7bd2d263feb135e28e3f95658984be702a633c23336a82857b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variantd9a9e8dba619d7bd2d263feb135e28e3f95658984be702a633c23336a82857b9.lean#L614).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d699139254f5b9e8aca76feedf3c9ea7c32fc88d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
