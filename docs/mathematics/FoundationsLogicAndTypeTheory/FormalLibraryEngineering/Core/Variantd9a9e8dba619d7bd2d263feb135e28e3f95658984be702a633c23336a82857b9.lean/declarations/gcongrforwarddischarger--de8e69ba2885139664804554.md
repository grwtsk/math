## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e96fc323d01a379233c1d66f05e5adac23a45ebdfefa3cc9676c9a597a5912f6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 564–573.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def gcongrForwardDischarger (goal : MVarId) : MetaM Bool := Elab.Term.TermElabM.run' do
  let mut hs := #[]
  -- collect the nontrivial hypotheses
  for h in ← getLCtx do
    if !h.isImplementationDetail then
      hs := hs.push (.fvar h.fvarId)
  -- run `Lean.MVarId.gcongrForward` on each one
  goal.gcongrForward hs

/-- Annotate `e` with a `gcongrHole` mdata annotation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variantd9a9e8dba619d7bd2d263feb135e28e3f95658984be702a633c23336a82857b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variantd9a9e8dba619d7bd2d263feb135e28e3f95658984be702a633c23336a82857b9.lean#L564).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d699139254f5b9e8aca76feedf3c9ea7c32fc88d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
