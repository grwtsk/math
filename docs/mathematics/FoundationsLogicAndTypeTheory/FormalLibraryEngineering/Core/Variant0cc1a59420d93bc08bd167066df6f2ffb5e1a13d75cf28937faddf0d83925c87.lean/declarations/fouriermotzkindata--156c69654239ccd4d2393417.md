## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:927b8cb4b28ad226de1fe6e6bbe7dff12d8d1a85304b73bda9bf2b2e6a00c4f3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 435–459.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure FourierMotzkinData where
  /-- Which variable is being eliminated. -/
  var : Nat
  /-- The "irrelevant" facts which do not involve the target variable. -/
  irrelevant : List Fact := []
  /--
  The facts which give a lower bound on the target variable,
  and the coefficient of the target variable in each.
  -/
  lowerBounds : List (Fact × Int) := []
  /--
  The facts which give an upper bound on the target variable,
  and the coefficient of the target variable in each.
  -/
  upperBounds : List (Fact × Int) := []
  /--
  Whether the elimination would be exact, because all of the lower bound coefficients are `±1`.
  -/
  lowerExact : Bool := true
  /--
  Whether the elimination would be exact, because all of the upper bound coefficients are `±1`.
  -/
  upperExact : Bool := true

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variant0cc1a59420d93bc08bd167066df6f2ffb5e1a13d75cf28937faddf0d83925c87.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variant0cc1a59420d93bc08bd167066df6f2ffb5e1a13d75cf28937faddf0d83925c87.lean#L435).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `68b9bfd0ef782c0ca264d6921b139f63ead97eeb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
