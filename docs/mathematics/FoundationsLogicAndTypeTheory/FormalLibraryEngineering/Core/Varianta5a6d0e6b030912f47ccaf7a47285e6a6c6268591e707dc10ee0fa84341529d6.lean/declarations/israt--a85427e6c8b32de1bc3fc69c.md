## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:04f68e73edb97da104a7df1936fb5ef63e16ba8e71e331a4b2ff371cd79905f3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 137–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive IsRat [Ring α] (a : α) (num : ℤ) (denom : ℕ) : Prop
  | mk (inv : Invertible (denom : α)) (eq : a = num * ⅟(denom : α))

/--
A "raw rat cast" is an expression of the form:

* `(Nat.rawCast lit : α)` where `lit` is a raw natural number literal
* `(Int.rawCast (Int.negOfNat lit) : α)` where `lit` is a nonzero raw natural number literal
* `(Rat.rawCast n d : α)` where `n` is a raw int cast, `d` is a raw nat cast, and `d` is not 1 or 0.

This representation is used by tactics like `ring` to decrease the number of typeclass arguments
required in each use of a number literal at type `α`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Varianta5a6d0e6b030912f47ccaf7a47285e6a6c6268591e707dc10ee0fa84341529d6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Varianta5a6d0e6b030912f47ccaf7a47285e6a6c6268591e707dc10ee0fa84341529d6.lean#L137).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d88113fb3ec45693170e797505bca22702d89d2c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
