## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b8fbb4c1f97792a3dc00db0402b8957748e8f144a1c023263060cc14f8d41402`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 277–301.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getSimpContext (cfg args : Syntax) (simpOnly := false) : TacticM Simp.Context := do
  let config ← elabSimpConfigCore cfg
  let simpTheorems ←
    if simpOnly then simpOnlyBuiltins.foldlM (·.addConst ·) {} else getSimpTheorems
  let mut { ctx, simprocs := _, starArg } ←
    elabSimpArgs args[0] (eraseLocal := false) (kind := .simp) (simprocs := {})
      (← Simp.mkContext config (simpTheorems := #[simpTheorems])
        (congrTheorems := ← getSimpCongrTheorems))
  unless starArg do return ctx
  let mut simpTheorems := ctx.simpTheorems
  for h in ← getPropHyps do
    unless simpTheorems.isErased (.fvar h) do
      simpTheorems ← simpTheorems.addTheorem (.fvar h) (← h.getDecl).toExpr
  return ctx.setSimpTheorems simpTheorems

Elaborates a call to `norm_num only? [args]` or `norm_num1`.
* `args`: the `(simpArgs)?` syntax for simp arguments
* `loc`: the `(location)?` syntax for the optional location argument
* `simpOnly`: true if `only` was used in `norm_num`
* `useSimp`: false if `norm_num1` was used, in which case only the structural parts
  of `simp` will be used, not any of the post-processing that `simp only` does without lemmas

-- FIXME: had to inline a bunch of stuff from `mkSimpContext` and `simpLocation` here

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variantdad5faa35ea1c2805baef8a74980494f07bc69e64b5b12ee3337f63161bd0d7c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variantdad5faa35ea1c2805baef8a74980494f07bc69e64b5b12ee3337f63161bd0d7c.lean#L277).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c7659707cfb462aee4fe5cfb00901ad061ddb9c1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
