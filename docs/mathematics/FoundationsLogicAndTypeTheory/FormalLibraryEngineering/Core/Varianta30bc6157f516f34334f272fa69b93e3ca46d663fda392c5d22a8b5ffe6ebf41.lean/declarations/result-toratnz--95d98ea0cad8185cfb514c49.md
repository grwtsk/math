## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b74b3aeee1faa34d1740188cf6c04faedd2f986b8a86ff61a03ce4dee49cee09`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 465–478.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Result.toRatNZ : Result e → Option (Rat × Option Expr)
  | .isBool .. => none
  | .isNat _ lit _ => some (lit.natLit!, none)
  | .isNegNat _ lit _ => some (-lit.natLit!, none)
  | .isRat _ q _ _ p => some (q, q(IsRat.den_nz $p))

/--
Constructs an `ofNat` application `a'` with the canonical instance, together with a proof that
the instance is equal to the result of `Nat.cast` on the given `AddMonoidWithOne` instance.

This function is performance-critical, as many higher level tactics have to construct numerals.
So rather than using typeclass search we hardcode the (relatively small) set of solutions
to the typeclass problem.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Varianta30bc6157f516f34334f272fa69b93e3ca46d663fda392c5d22a8b5ffe6ebf41.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Varianta30bc6157f516f34334f272fa69b93e3ca46d663fda392c5d22a8b5ffe6ebf41.lean#L465).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ea504545bdab3fe86cd2be060e62a98cf8977398` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
