## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a372a6f166caa00cff4ec93826d298a178d94787a849e4f48de48e5317e666d6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 297–312.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def selectEquality (p : Problem) : Option (Coeffs × Nat) :=
  p.equalities.fold (init := none) fun
  | none, c => (c, c.minNatAbs)
  | some (r, m), c =>
    if 2 ≤ m then
      let m' := c.minNatAbs
      if (m' < m || m' = m && c.maxNatAbs < r.maxNatAbs) then
        (c, m')
      else
        (r, m)
    else
      (r, m)

/--
If we have already solved some equalities, apply those to some new `Fact`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variant360f26fdc63a5e2b6a9e10f8fbca4de5a5c5fe6d99ce2b0ffd12984ef55623a0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variant360f26fdc63a5e2b6a9e10f8fbca4de5a5c5fe6d99ce2b0ffd12984ef55623a0.lean#L297).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a79450ed09eccb18156b2f46b604fda60a4f157a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
