## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ac0e6b1b0196692049da31b94fee77717d1744afb4f425729b4f86f58b069d17`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 404–421.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def addInequality (p : Problem) (const : Int) (coeffs : Coeffs) (prf? : Option Proof) : Problem :=
  let prf := prf?.getD (do mkSorry (← mkFreshExprMVar none) false)
  let i := p.assumptions.size
  let p' := { p with assumptions := p.assumptions.push (addInequality_proof const coeffs prf) }
  let f : Fact :=
  { coeffs
    constraint := { lowerBound := some (-const), upperBound := none }
    justification := .assumption _ _ i }
  let f := p.replayEliminations f
  let f := f.tidy
  p'.addConstraint f

/--
Helper function for adding an equality of the form `const + Coeffs.dot coeffs atoms = 0`
to a `Problem`.

(This is only used while initializing a `Problem`. During elimination we use `addConstraint`.)
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variant360f26fdc63a5e2b6a9e10f8fbca4de5a5c5fe6d99ce2b0ffd12984ef55623a0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variant360f26fdc63a5e2b6a9e10f8fbca4de5a5c5fe6d99ce2b0ffd12984ef55623a0.lean#L404).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a79450ed09eccb18156b2f46b604fda60a4f157a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
