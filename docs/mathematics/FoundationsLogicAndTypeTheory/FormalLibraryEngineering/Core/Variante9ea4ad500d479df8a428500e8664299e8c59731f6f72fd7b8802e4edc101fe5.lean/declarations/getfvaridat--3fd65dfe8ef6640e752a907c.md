## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b7a2733d667211a5cfdb91fbbc9fb882e4dad1b914a7844b30602397d7f58640`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 143–157.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getFVarIdAt (goal : MVarId) (id : Syntax) : TacticM FVarId := withRef id do
  -- use apply-like elaboration to suppress insertion of implicit arguments
  let e ← goal.withContext do
    elabTermForApply id (mayPostpone := false)
  match e with
  | Expr.fvar fvarId => return fvarId
  | _                => throwError "unexpected term '{e}'; expected single reference to variable"

/-- Get the array of `FVarId`s in the local context of the given `goal`.

If `ids` is specified, elaborate them in the local context of the given goal to obtain the array of
`FVarId`s.

If `includeImplementationDetails` is `false` (the default), we filter out implementation details
(`implDecl`s and `auxDecl`s) from the resulting list of `FVarId`s. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variante9ea4ad500d479df8a428500e8664299e8c59731f6f72fd7b8802e4edc101fe5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variante9ea4ad500d479df8a428500e8664299e8c59731f6f72fd7b8802e4edc101fe5.lean#L143).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f3b7be3bc22e265d8ff9eaa89d4afdf7e137c2e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
