## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:824d76b7-0050-c9b4-0898-a7847ecbc42c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 178–193.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem verify_point_upper_bound (e : Expr) (hsupp : ExprSupportedCore e)
    (x c : ℚ) (cfg : EvalConfig)
    (h_cert : checkPointUpperBound e x c cfg = true) :
    Expr.eval (fun _ => (x : ℝ)) e ≤ c := by
  simp only [checkPointUpperBound, Bool.and_eq_true, decide_eq_true_eq] at h_cert
  let Ipt : IntervalRat := ⟨x, x, le_refl x⟩
  have hdom := checkDomainValid1_correct e Ipt cfg h_cert.1
  have hhi := h_cert.2
  have hx_mem : (x : ℝ) ∈ Ipt := ⟨le_refl _, le_refl _⟩
  exact exprCore_le_of_interval_hi e hsupp Ipt c cfg hdom hhi (x : ℝ) hx_mem

/-- **Argmax Verification Theorem**

    Proves `∀ y ∈ I, f(y) ≤ f(x)` (x is a maximizer) by:
    1. Checking that `∀ y ∈ I, f(y) ≤ c` (the max over I is at most c)
    2. Checking that `c ≤ f(x)` (the value at x is at least c) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variant76adeff1d43c268125464fe461dc215a744b0f148e0504b9ec0d065813b41382.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variant76adeff1d43c268125464fe461dc215a744b0f148e0504b9ec0d065813b41382.lean#L178).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `04b82ce9502d0c110ba733da183b6aafc7900224` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
