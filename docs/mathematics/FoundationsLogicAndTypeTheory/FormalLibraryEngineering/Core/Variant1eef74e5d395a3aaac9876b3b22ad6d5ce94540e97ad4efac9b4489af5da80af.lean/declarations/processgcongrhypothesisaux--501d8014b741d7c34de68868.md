## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e6e03f7503f734ae49fb90515e2e64dafa29e736597f7b9caa7edea3350b93a9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 212–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def processGCongrHypothesisAux (goal : MVarId) (forward : Bool) (config : Config) :
    GRewriteM Bool := do
  let some (relName, rel?, lhs, rhs) := getRel' (← whnf (← goal.getType)) |
    throwError "internal `grewrite` error: invalid `gcongr` goal {goal}"
  let (target, mvarApp) := if forward then (lhs, rhs) else (rhs, lhs)
  if let some (result, proof) ← grewriteCore relName rel? target forward config then
    mvarApp.withApp fun mvar xs ↦ do
      /- Note: the names of the free variables `xs` end up in the new goal as lambda binders.
      `applyGCongrLemma` ensures that these are the binder names that appear in the original goal.
      As a result, when rewriting inside of `{x | p x}`, the binder name `x` is preserved. -/
      mvar.mvarId!.assign (← mkLambdaFVars xs result)
      goal.assign proof
      return true
  else
    return false

/-- Update the local contexts of the metavariables to include the variables introduced by the
`gcongr` lemma. This is a bit of a hack.

Returns whether we have done a rewrite in this subgoal, in which case it has been closed. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variant1eef74e5d395a3aaac9876b3b22ad6d5ce94540e97ad4efac9b4489af5da80af.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Core/Variant1eef74e5d395a3aaac9876b3b22ad6d5ce94540e97ad4efac9b4489af5da80af.lean#L212).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ab49a281dea040b7acb0241da450ca4b497e2c57` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
