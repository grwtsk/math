## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4cca3f296c32047c25f29c2d916fa1993743f9da015f6897183c6992fdd1dc85`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 38–47.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[inline] private def reduceBin (declName : Name) (arity : Nat) (op : {n : Nat} → Fin n → Fin n → Fin n) (e : Expr) : SimpM DStep := do
  unless e.isAppOfArity declName arity do return .continue
  let some v₁ ← fromExpr? e.appFn!.appArg! | return .continue
  let some v₂ ← fromExpr? e.appArg! | return .continue
  if h : v₁.n = v₂.n then
    let v := op v₁.value (h ▸ v₂.value)
    return .done <| toExpr v
  else
    return .continue

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Fin/Variant6e22f4a410ec146af6481c30693c141c4f9d120db24e5d2bc5a1e6a873915bdc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Fin/Variant6e22f4a410ec146af6481c30693c141c4f9d120db24e5d2bc5a1e6a873915bdc.lean#L38).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bb03b01f43d905e0e5bda35b0075a9be0c1d68ac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
