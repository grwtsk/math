## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4120b85299e546fb3b4d8fa19b96ce0d3861ecf17b7164d3154d1109afd38b85`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 96–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getExplicitRelArgCore (tgt rel x z : Expr) : MetaM (Expr × Expr) := do
  match rel with
  | Expr.app rel' _ => do
    let check: Bool ← do
      try
        let folded ← mkAppM' rel' #[x, z]
        isDefEq folded tgt
      catch _ =>
        pure false
    if !check then
      return (rel, x)
    else
      getExplicitRelArgCore tgt rel' x z
  | _ => return (rel ,x)

/--
`trans` applies to a goal whose target has the form `t ~ u` where `~` is a transitive relation,
that is, a relation which has a transitivity lemma tagged with the attribute [trans].

* `trans s` replaces the goal with the two subgoals `t ~ s` and `s ~ u`.
* If `s` is omitted, then a metavariable is used instead.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Trans/Variant8053f2fbf980b86b3a58e3c67ed674da7d99619c7a5597c8b4038723ff245b0e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Trans/Variant8053f2fbf980b86b3a58e3c67ed674da7d99619c7a5597c8b4038723ff245b0e.lean#L96).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `91d617875b17d4c5ce9b937ef90d3672212b2d57` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
