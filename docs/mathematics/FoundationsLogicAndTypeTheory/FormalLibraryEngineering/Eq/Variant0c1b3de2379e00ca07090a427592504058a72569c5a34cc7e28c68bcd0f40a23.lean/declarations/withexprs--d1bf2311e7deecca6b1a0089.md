## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d433c87037889b0ceee61c0a89aa6ae8cb3e4017e9696341cc23563c77624ee0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 27–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[specialize] def withExprs (a b : Expr) (k : ACM Unit) : GoalM Unit := do
  let ids₁ ← getTermOpIds a
  if ids₁.isEmpty then return ()
  let ids₂ ← getTermOpIds b
  go ids₁ ids₂
where
  go : List Nat → List Nat → GoalM Unit
    | [], _ => return ()
    | _, [] => return ()
    | id₁::ids₁, id₂::ids₂ => do
      if id₁ == id₂ then
        ACM.run id₁ k; go ids₁ ids₂
      else if id₁ < id₂ then
        go ids₁ (id₂::ids₂)
      else
        go (id₁::ids₁) ids₂

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Eq/Variant0c1b3de2379e00ca07090a427592504058a72569c5a34cc7e28c68bcd0f40a23.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Eq/Variant0c1b3de2379e00ca07090a427592504058a72569c5a34cc7e28c68bcd0f40a23.lean#L27).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2132d1d411da30e861fc3a1082696c4f1ffa15c3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
