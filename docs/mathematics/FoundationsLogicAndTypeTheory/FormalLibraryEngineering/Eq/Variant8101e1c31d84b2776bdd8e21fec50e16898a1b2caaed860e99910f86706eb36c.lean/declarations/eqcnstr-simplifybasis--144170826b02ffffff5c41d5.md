## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5e859aba0a19860cb26b606cf2b0055c74caa4c6efa9d5cbd4bfd2219822138a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 314–327.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def EqCnstr.simplifyBasis (c : EqCnstr) : ACM Unit := do
  let rec go (basis : List EqCnstr) (acc : List EqCnstr) : ACM (List EqCnstr) := do
    match basis with
    | [] => return acc.reverse
    | c' :: basis =>
      if let some c'' ← c'.simplifyWith c then
        trace[grind.debug.ac.simp] "{← c'.denoteExpr} using {← c.denoteExpr} := {← c''.denoteExpr}"
        c''.addToQueue
        go basis acc
      else
        go basis (c' :: acc)
  let basis ← go (← getStruct).basis []
  modifyStruct fun s => { s with basis }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Eq/Variant8101e1c31d84b2776bdd8e21fec50e16898a1b2caaed860e99910f86706eb36c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Eq/Variant8101e1c31d84b2776bdd8e21fec50e16898a1b2caaed860e99910f86706eb36c.lean#L314).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f46beb9bb2ba3bc882d85252c962cbd3689e9475` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
