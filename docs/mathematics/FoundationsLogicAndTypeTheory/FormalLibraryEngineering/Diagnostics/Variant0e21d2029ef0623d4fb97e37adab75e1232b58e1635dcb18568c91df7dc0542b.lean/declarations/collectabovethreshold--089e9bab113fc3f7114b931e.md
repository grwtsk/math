## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8d75eb42c26367cf9fd02d16c191aff4d17dea5b32bbe9e023fc2d02d2385cb8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 24–31.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def collectAboveThreshold [BEq α] [Hashable α] (counters : PHashMap α Nat) (threshold : Nat) (p : α → Bool) (lt : α → α → Bool) : Array (α × Nat) := Id.run do
  let mut r := #[]
  for (declName, counter) in counters do
    if counter > threshold then
    if p declName then
      r := r.push (declName, counter)
  return r.qsort fun (d₁, c₁) (d₂, c₂) => if c₁ == c₂ then lt d₁ d₂ else c₁ > c₂

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Diagnostics/Variant0e21d2029ef0623d4fb97e37adab75e1232b58e1635dcb18568c91df7dc0542b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Diagnostics/Variant0e21d2029ef0623d4fb97e37adab75e1232b58e1635dcb18568c91df7dc0542b.lean#L24).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1cb4711929f294c53b5f45b7792902ed8b598f5a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
