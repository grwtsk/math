## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f2030bc855af6c9696150b4b9c7836ba816c0d72a09aebaf61bde5ca2de60522`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 743–753.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def recvSelector (ch : CloseableChannel α) : Selector (Option α) :=
  match ch with
  | .unbounded ch => CloseableChannel.Unbounded.recvSelector ch
  | .zero ch => CloseableChannel.Zero.recvSelector ch
  | .bounded ch => CloseableChannel.Bounded.recvSelector ch

/--
`ch.forAsync f` calls `f` for every message received on `ch`.

Note that if this function is called twice, each message will only arrive at exactly one invocation.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Channel/Variant1181d186b66ab03aaf90e18f3c38131b936228fdc2fafb9b3430578cf28a6b48.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Channel/Variant1181d186b66ab03aaf90e18f3c38131b936228fdc2fafb9b3430578cf28a6b48.lean#L743).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bfa7a62d4f31124b44a2a129ffefde2780fefdb1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
