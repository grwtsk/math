## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3f69ee1372bd545087f77dce83b8536c3adc3385c86d0018dfa7db581536c573`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 61–77.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def Consumer.resolve (c : Consumer α) (x : Option α) : BaseIO Bool := do
  match c with
  | .normal promise =>
    promise.resolve x
    return true
  | .select waiter =>
    let lose := return false
    let win promise := do
      promise.resolve (.ok x)
      return true
    waiter.race lose win

/--
The central state structure for an unbounded channel. Maintains the following invariants:
1. `values = ∅ ∨ consumers = ∅`
2. `closed = true → consumers = ∅`
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Channel/Variant1181d186b66ab03aaf90e18f3c38131b936228fdc2fafb9b3430578cf28a6b48.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Channel/Variant1181d186b66ab03aaf90e18f3c38131b936228fdc2fafb9b3430578cf28a6b48.lean#L61).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bfa7a62d4f31124b44a2a129ffefde2780fefdb1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
