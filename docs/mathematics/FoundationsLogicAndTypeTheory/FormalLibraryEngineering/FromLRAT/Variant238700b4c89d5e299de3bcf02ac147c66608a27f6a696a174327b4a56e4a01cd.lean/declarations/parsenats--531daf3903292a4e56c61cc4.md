## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:20c46f215c0f28a7b7738aab82362bc7700c3f7aadbc154174dc44172c40fcb1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 525–531.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def parseNats (arr : Array Nat := #[]) : String.Parser (Array Nat) := do
  match ← parseNat <* ws with
  | 0 => pure arr
  | n => parseNats (arr.push n)

/-- Parse a DIMACS format `.cnf` file.
This is not very robust; we assume the file has had comments stripped. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FromLRAT/Variant238700b4c89d5e299de3bcf02ac147c66608a27f6a696a174327b4a56e4a01cd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FromLRAT/Variant238700b4c89d5e299de3bcf02ac147c66608a27f6a696a174327b4a56e4a01cd.lean#L525).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b4ab0143bb599d2d5e7474dd92188f75f89c80e1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
