## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:baaf2380-2bef-191e-c9e2-e7c94e7c0b89`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 290–293.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma IsBasis.contract_isBasis (h : M.IsBasis I X) (hJC : M.IsBasis J C)
    (h_ind : M.Indep (I \ C ∪ J)) : (M ／ C).IsBasis (I \ C) (X \ C) :=
  h.contract_isBasis_of_isBasis' hJC.isBasis' h_ind

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Contract/Variantf51981e6baf0c8cec97614f162fd5f2a7f556e727b1107616fdb4a68dddac71c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Contract/Variantf51981e6baf0c8cec97614f162fd5f2a7f556e727b1107616fdb4a68dddac71c.lean#L290).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `95268aafc7cee76f5ca4a9534dcdf5010b14443d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
