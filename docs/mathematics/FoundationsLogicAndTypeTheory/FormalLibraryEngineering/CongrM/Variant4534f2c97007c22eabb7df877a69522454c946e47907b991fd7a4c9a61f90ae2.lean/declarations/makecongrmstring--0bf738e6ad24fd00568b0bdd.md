## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:607da30db4aa945d54145ac5ee3d0348b9db788db37412a81a7b14937aaf06ec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 32–47.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def makeCongrMString (pos : Array Lean.SubExpr.GoalsLocation) (goalType : Expr)
    (_ : SelectInsertParams) : MetaM (String × String × Option (String.Pos × String.Pos)) := do
  let subexprPos := getGoalLocations pos
  unless goalType.isAppOf ``Eq || goalType.isAppOf ``Iff do
    throwError "The goal must be an equality or iff."
  let mut goalTypeWithMetaVars := goalType
  for pos in subexprPos do
    goalTypeWithMetaVars ← insertMetaVar goalTypeWithMetaVars pos

  let side := if subexprPos[0]!.toArray[0]! = 0 then 1 else 2
  let sideExpr := goalTypeWithMetaVars.getAppArgs[side]!
  let res := "congrm " ++ (toString (← Meta.ppExpr sideExpr)).renameMetaVar
  return (res, res, none)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CongrM/Variant4534f2c97007c22eabb7df877a69522454c946e47907b991fd7a4c9a61f90ae2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CongrM/Variant4534f2c97007c22eabb7df877a69522454c946e47907b991fd7a4c9a61f90ae2.lean#L32).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6956ab79c96d07a9f22d03101048bd758fc6150d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
