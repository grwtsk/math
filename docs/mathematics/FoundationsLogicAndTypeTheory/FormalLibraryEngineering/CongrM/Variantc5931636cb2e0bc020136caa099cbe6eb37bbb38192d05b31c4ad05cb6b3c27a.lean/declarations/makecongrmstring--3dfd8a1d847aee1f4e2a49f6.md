## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5156b602ba29796b7316c7eb8d0b84aff53a0b30fd5fdcced3640c1440ee21b4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 28–44.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def makeCongrMString (pos : Array Lean.SubExpr.GoalsLocation) (goalType : Expr)
    (_ : SelectInsertParams) :
    MetaM (String × String × Option (String.Pos.Raw × String.Pos.Raw)) := do
  let subexprPos := getGoalLocations pos
  unless goalType.isAppOf ``Eq || goalType.isAppOf ``Iff do
    throwError "The goal must be an equality or iff."
  let mut goalTypeWithMetaVars := goalType
  for pos in subexprPos do
    goalTypeWithMetaVars ← insertMetaVar goalTypeWithMetaVars pos

  let side := if subexprPos[0]!.toArray[0]! = 0 then 1 else 2
  let sideExpr := goalTypeWithMetaVars.getAppArgs[side]!
  let res := "congrm " ++ (toString (← Meta.ppExpr sideExpr)).renameMetaVar
  return (res, res, none)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CongrM/Variantc5931636cb2e0bc020136caa099cbe6eb37bbb38192d05b31c4ad05cb6b3c27a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CongrM/Variantc5931636cb2e0bc020136caa099cbe6eb37bbb38192d05b31c4ad05cb6b3c27a.lean#L28).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6bdf8e0f7ab76c3e3bc3823f804dfa5520fe9161` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
