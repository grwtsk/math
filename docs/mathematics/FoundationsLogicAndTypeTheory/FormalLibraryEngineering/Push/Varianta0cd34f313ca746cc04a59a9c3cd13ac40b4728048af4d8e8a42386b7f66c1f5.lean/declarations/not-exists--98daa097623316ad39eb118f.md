## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8ed19ec5-cf0d-2bf7-db8d-7cb63723aaa2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 48–68.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[push] theorem not_exists : (¬ Exists s) ↔ (∀ x, binderNameHint x s <| ¬ s x) :=
  _root_.not_exists

-- TODO: lemmas involving `∃` should be tagged using `binderNameHint`,
-- and lemmas involving `∀` would need manual rewriting to keep the binder name.
attribute [push]
  forall_const forall_and forall_or_left forall_or_right forall_eq forall_eq' Classical.skolem
  exists_const exists_or exists_and_left exists_and_right exists_eq exists_eq'
  and_or_left and_or_right and_true true_and and_false false_and
  or_and_left or_and_right or_true true_or or_false false_or

-- these lemmas are only for the `pull` tactic
attribute [push low]
  forall_and_left forall_and_right -- needs lower priority than `forall_and` in the `pull` tactic

attribute [push ←] Function.id_def

-- TODO: decide if we want this lemma, and if so, fix the proofs that break as a result
-- @[push high] theorem Nat.not_nonneg_iff_eq_zero (n : Nat) : ¬ 0 < n ↔ n = 0 :=
--   Nat.not_lt.trans Nat.le_zero

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Push/Varianta0cd34f313ca746cc04a59a9c3cd13ac40b4728048af4d8e8a42386b7f66c1f5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Push/Varianta0cd34f313ca746cc04a59a9c3cd13ac40b4728048af4d8e8a42386b7f66c1f5.lean#L48).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `734a5a1ab956d0a0a9362e968e54dc8231910429` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
