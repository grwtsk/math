## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dcc9500e6c168bb8cf07c76f3d90149e164c9f12a93875b0b9ae3889c9f8593f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 188–196.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def pushNegTarget : TacticM Unit := withMainContext do
  let goal ← getMainGoal
  let tgt ← instantiateMVars (← goal.getType)
  let newGoal ← applySimpResultToTarget goal tgt (← pushNegCore tgt)
  if newGoal == goal then throwError "push_neg made no progress"
  replaceMainGoal [newGoal]


/-- Execute main loop of `push_neg` at a local hypothesis. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Push/Variant812f664b6bf544e9f026d65a4e7e568663813cc49baf183dc29c169aaf637141.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Push/Variant812f664b6bf544e9f026d65a4e7e568663813cc49baf183dc29c169aaf637141.lean#L188).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `97979acb6d1d05405d95c9dcd5c21c0560864672` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
