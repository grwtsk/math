## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b7f33eef711e2bba516b45fdca1ebbbb7ec6e24b009588214a39b6717479e801`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–85.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Config where
  /-- If `true` (default `false`), rewrite `¬ (p ∧ q)` into `¬ p ∨ ¬ q` instead of `p → ¬ q`. -/
  distrib : Bool := false

/-- Function elaborating `Push.Config`. -/
declare_config_elab elabPushConfig Config

/--
`pushNegBuiltin` is a simproc for pushing `¬` in a way that can't be done
using the `@[push]` attribute.
- `¬ (p ∧ q)` turns into `p → ¬ q` or `¬ p ∨ ¬ q`, depending on the `distrib` configuration.
- `¬ ∀ a, p` turns into `∃ a, ¬ p`, where the binder name `a` is preserved.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Push/Variant697e3a233e245e2642a7dff36f60baf4fc55df2e43dd6ef188f227ae46e46ba2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Push/Variant697e3a233e245e2642a7dff36f60baf4fc55df2e43dd6ef188f227ae46e46ba2.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7351c5251d9fa65fa3f75145b8d6367065f8b2fd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
