## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cd11d86336edac547b5a56563d961249fc1cd8ee4b125480c463762bcef0cc3c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 175–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def resolvePushId? (stx : Term) : TermElabM (Option Expr) := do
  match ← liftMacroM <| expandMacros stx with
  | `($f $args*) =>
    -- Note: we would like to insist that all arguments in the notation are given as underscores,
    -- but for example `∑ x, _` expands to `Finset.sum Finset.univ fun _ ↦ _`,
    -- in which `Finset.univ` is not an underscore. So instead
    -- we only insist that the last argument is an underscore.
    if args.back?.all isUnderscore then
      try resolveId? f catch _ => return none
    else
      return none
  | `(binop% $f _ _)
  | `(binop_lazy% $f _ _)
  | `(leftact% $f _ _)
  | `(rightact% $f _ _)
  | `(binrel% $f _ _)
  | `(binrel_no_prop% $f _ _)
  | `(unop% $f _)
  | f => try resolveId? f catch _ => return none

/-- Elaborator for the argument passed to `push`. It accepts a constant, or a function -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Push/Variant697e3a233e245e2642a7dff36f60baf4fc55df2e43dd6ef188f227ae46e46ba2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Push/Variant697e3a233e245e2642a7dff36f60baf4fc55df2e43dd6ef188f227ae46e46ba2.lean#L175).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7351c5251d9fa65fa3f75145b8d6367065f8b2fd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
