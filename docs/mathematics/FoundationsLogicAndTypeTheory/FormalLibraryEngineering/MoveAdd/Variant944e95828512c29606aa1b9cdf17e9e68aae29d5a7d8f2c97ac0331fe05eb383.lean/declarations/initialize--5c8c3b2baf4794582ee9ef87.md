## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `initialize` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:326a48a89ae57d28c48b40174a8c95a7b6b749152834c07df2df38eadd02944a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 424–440.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
initialize registerTraceClass `Tactic.move_oper

/-- The tactic `move_add` rearranges summands of expressions.
Calling `move_add [a, ← b, ...]` matches `a, b,...` with summands in the main goal.
It then moves `a` to the far right and `b` to the far left of each addition in which they appear.
The side to which the summands are moved is determined by the presence or absence of the arrow `←`.

The inputs `a, b,...` can be any terms, also with underscores.
The tactic uses the first "new" summand that unifies with each one of the given inputs.

There is a multiplicative variant, called `move_mul`.

There is also a general tactic for a "binary associative commutative operation": `move_oper`.
In this case the syntax requires providing first a term whose head symbol is the operation.
E.g. `move_oper HAdd.hAdd [...]` is the same as `move_add`, while `move_oper Max.max [...]`
rearranges `max`s.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MoveAdd/Variant944e95828512c29606aa1b9cdf17e9e68aae29d5a7d8f2c97ac0331fe05eb383.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MoveAdd/Variant944e95828512c29606aa1b9cdf17e9e68aae29d5a7d8f2c97ac0331fe05eb383.lean#L424).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `abb6107c6f0c1525bbaf41e0beeff2a2b4118678` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
