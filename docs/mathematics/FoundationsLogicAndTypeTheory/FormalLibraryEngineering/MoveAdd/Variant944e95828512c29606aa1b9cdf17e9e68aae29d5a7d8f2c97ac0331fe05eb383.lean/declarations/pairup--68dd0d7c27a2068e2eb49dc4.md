## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:94743440eb0ad241cd16701a5c6f384011c2440347be94e11a84259af8205fe3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 327–339.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def pairUp : List (Expr × Bool × Syntax) → List Expr →
    MetaM ((List (Expr × Bool)) × List (Expr × Bool × Syntax))
  | (m::ms), l => do
    match ← l.findM? (isDefEq · m.1) with
      | none => let (found, unfound) ← pairUp ms l; return (found, m::unfound)
      | some d => let (found, unfound) ← pairUp ms (l.erase d)
                  return ((d, m.2.1)::found, unfound)
  | _, _ => return ([], [])

/-- `move_oper_simpCtx` is the `Simp.Context` for the reordering internal to `move_oper`.
To support a new binary operation, extend the list in this definition, so that it contains
enough lemmas to allow `simp` to close a generic permutation goal for the new binary operation.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MoveAdd/Variant944e95828512c29606aa1b9cdf17e9e68aae29d5a7d8f2c97ac0331fe05eb383.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MoveAdd/Variant944e95828512c29606aa1b9cdf17e9e68aae29d5a7d8f2c97ac0331fe05eb383.lean#L327).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `abb6107c6f0c1525bbaf41e0beeff2a2b4118678` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
