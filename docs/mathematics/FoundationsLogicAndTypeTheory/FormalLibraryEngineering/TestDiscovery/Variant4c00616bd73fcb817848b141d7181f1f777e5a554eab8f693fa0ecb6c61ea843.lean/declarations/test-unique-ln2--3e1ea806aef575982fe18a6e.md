## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0e6a2388-2376-951e-3116-76b90e9e02c0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 216–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem test_unique_ln2 : ∃! x, x ∈ I_0_1 ∧
    Expr.eval (fun _ => x) (Expr.add (Expr.exp (Expr.var 0)) (Expr.neg (Expr.const 2))) = 0 := by
  interval_unique_root

-- NOTE: Tests for sin(x)=0 on [3,4] and cos(x)=0 on [1,2] are commented out because
-- the Newton contraction check fails on these wider intervals (the tactic needs tighter
-- initial brackets for transcendental functions).
-- The interval arithmetic is sound, but these intervals are too wide for single-step contraction.

/-! ## interval_integrate Tests

The `interval_integrate` tactic proves goals of the form `∫ x in lo..hi, f(x) ∈ bound`
where the bound is computed via interval arithmetic.
-/

-- Test 1: ∫_0^1 x dx = 1/2, should be in [0, 1] (conservative bound)
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TestDiscovery/Variant4c00616bd73fcb817848b141d7181f1f777e5a554eab8f693fa0ecb6c61ea843.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TestDiscovery/Variant4c00616bd73fcb817848b141d7181f1f777e5a554eab8f693fa0ecb6c61ea843.lean#L216).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f750735ba240f5db8a629c8113eac5cebe8979db` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
