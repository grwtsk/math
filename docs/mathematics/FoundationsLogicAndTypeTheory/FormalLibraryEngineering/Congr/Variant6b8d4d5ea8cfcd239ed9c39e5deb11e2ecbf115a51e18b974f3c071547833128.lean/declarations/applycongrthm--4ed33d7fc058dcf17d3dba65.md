## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6c42752624e943217b72ec8681474b456b81e2e3fd7dd4a7dea2ab9dfa620956`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 197–235.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def applyCongrThm?
    (config : Congr!.Config) (mvarId : MVarId) (congrThmType congrThmProof : Expr) :
    MetaM (List MVarId) := do
  trace[congr!] "trying to apply congr lemma {congrThmType}"
  try
    let mvarId ← mvarId.assert (← mkFreshUserName `h_congr_thm) congrThmType congrThmProof
    let (fvarId, mvarId) ← mvarId.intro1P
    let mvarIds ← withTransparency config.transparency <|
      mvarId.apply (mkFVar fvarId) { synthAssignedInstances := false }
    mvarIds.mapM fun mvarId => mvarId.tryClear fvarId
  catch e =>
    withTraceNode `congr! (fun _ => pure m!"failed to apply congr lemma") do
      trace[congr!] "{e.toMessageData}"
    throw e

/--
Create a congruence lemma to prove that `HEq (f a₁ ... aₙ) (f' a₁' ... aₙ')`.
Each argument produces a `HEq aᵢ aᵢ'` hypothesis, but we also supply these hypotheses the
hypotheses that the preceding equalities have been proved (unlike in `mkHCongrWithArity`).
The first two arguments of the resulting theorem are for `f` and `f'`, followed by a proof
of `f = f'`.

When including hypotheses about previous hypotheses, we make use of dependency information
and only include relevant equalities.

The argument `fty` denotes the type of `f`. Returns `(congrThmType, congrThmProof)`.

For the purpose of generating nicer lemmas that have a better chance at something like
`to_additive` rewriting, this function supports generating lemmas where certain parameters
are meant to be fixed.

* If `fixedFun` is `false` (the default) then the lemma starts with three arguments for `f`, `f'`,
and `h : f = f'`. Otherwise, if `fixedFun` is `true` then the lemma starts with just `f`.

* If the `fixedParams` argument has `true` for a particular argument index, then this is a hint
that the congruence lemma may use the same parameter for both sides of the equality. There is
no guarantee -- it respects it if the types are equal for that parameter (i.e., if the parameter
does not depend on non-fixed parameters).

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Congr/Variant6b8d4d5ea8cfcd239ed9c39e5deb11e2ecbf115a51e18b974f3c071547833128.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Congr/Variant6b8d4d5ea8cfcd239ed9c39e5deb11e2ecbf115a51e18b974f3c071547833128.lean#L197).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c3c4de23449c1822e987fa2b2b16809b1de82fe2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
