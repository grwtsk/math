## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:47c9e0396c87e9009aba582d7c15a43fdfb8850abc3c6ab56d90779d770dffb3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 663–670.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Lean.MVarId.obviousHfunext? (mvarId : MVarId) : MetaM (Option (List MVarId)) :=
  mvarId.withContext <| observing? do
    let some (_, lhs, _, rhs) := (← withReducible mvarId.getType').heq? | failure
    if not lhs.cleanupAnnotations.isLambda && not rhs.cleanupAnnotations.isLambda then failure
    mvarId.apply (← mkConstWithFreshMVarLevels `Function.hfunext)

/-- Like `implies_congr` but provides an additional assumption to the second hypothesis.
This is a non-dependent version of `pi_congr` that allows the domains to be different. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Congr/Variantc590e4ac269203922fe409beb2a778ba5996043c49a93a3db5e32d3bc639da35.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Congr/Variantc590e4ac269203922fe409beb2a778ba5996043c49a93a3db5e32d3bc639da35.lean#L663).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5dab970ac46b8d79d823379ea7951e93247fbb02` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
