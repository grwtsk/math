## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9f982820550b31e680c79e3f7f95a3b7f1e4bf67bd1a77506828a3d2eb978b3a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 261–276.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def splitIfAt? (mvarId : MVarId) (e : Expr) (hName? : Option Name) : MetaM (Option (ByCasesSubgoal × ByCasesSubgoal)) := mvarId.withContext do
  let e ← instantiateMVars e
  if let some (cond, decInst) ← findIfToSplit? e then
    let hName ← match hName? with
      | none       => mkFreshUserName `h
      | some hName => pure hName
    trace[Meta.Tactic.splitIf] "splitting on {decInst}"
    return some (← mvarId.byCasesDec cond decInst hName)
  else
    trace[Meta.Tactic.splitIf] "could not find if to split:{indentExpr e}"
    return none

end SplitIf

open SplitIf

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SplitIf/Variant7fcecd5d5eab26cf22253d8ac06d9b5f10453dc624738724bf53949ffcca0321.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SplitIf/Variant7fcecd5d5eab26cf22253d8ac06d9b5f10453dc624738724bf53949ffcca0321.lean#L261).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c7cfa824de083dacc2a2d73157b51d23aa33eb2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
