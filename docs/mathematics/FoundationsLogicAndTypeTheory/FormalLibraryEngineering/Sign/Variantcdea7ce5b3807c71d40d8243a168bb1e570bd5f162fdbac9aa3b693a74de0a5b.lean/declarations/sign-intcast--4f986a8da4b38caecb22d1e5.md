## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f01f7098-80c5-3ad6-857a-30c4504b2263`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sign_intCast (z : ℤ) : sign (z : ℝ) = ↑(Int.sign z) := by
  obtain hn | rfl | hp := lt_trichotomy z (0 : ℤ)
  · rw [sign_of_neg (Int.cast_lt_zero.mpr hn), Int.sign_eq_neg_one_of_neg hn, Int.cast_neg,
      Int.cast_one]
  · rw [Int.cast_zero, sign_zero, Int.sign_zero, Int.cast_zero]
  · rw [sign_of_pos (Int.cast_pos.mpr hp), Int.sign_eq_one_of_pos hp, Int.cast_one]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Sign/Variantcdea7ce5b3807c71d40d8243a168bb1e570bd5f162fdbac9aa3b693a74de0a5b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Sign/Variantcdea7ce5b3807c71d40d8243a168bb1e570bd5f162fdbac9aa3b693a74de0a5b.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `949462ab6a884fd1a7c04a3361071b688516f901` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
