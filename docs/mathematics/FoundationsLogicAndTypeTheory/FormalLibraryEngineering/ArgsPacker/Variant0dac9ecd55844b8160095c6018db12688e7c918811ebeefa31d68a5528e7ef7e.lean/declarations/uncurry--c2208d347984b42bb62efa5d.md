## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:42576b989db2d7dd608303c85a7706e69ff09ae6cc84fd74306fd38b08018654`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 418–429.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
def uncurry (es : Array Expr) : MetaM Expr := do
  let types ← es.mapM inferType
  let resultType ← uncurryType types
  uncurryWithType resultType es

/--
Given unary expressions `e₁`, `e₂` with types `(x : A) → R`
and `(z : C) → R`, returns an expression of type

(x : A ⊕' C) → R
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ArgsPacker/Variant0dac9ecd55844b8160095c6018db12688e7c918811ebeefa31d68a5528e7ef7e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ArgsPacker/Variant0dac9ecd55844b8160095c6018db12688e7c918811ebeefa31d68a5528e7ef7e.lean#L418).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a5ae703aafdb4f3075c9fae1e3fa45a9849c0d2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
