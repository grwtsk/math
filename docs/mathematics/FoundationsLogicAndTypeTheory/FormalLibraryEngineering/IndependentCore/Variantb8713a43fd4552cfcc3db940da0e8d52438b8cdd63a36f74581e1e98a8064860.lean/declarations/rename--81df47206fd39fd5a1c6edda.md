## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b06f472a-7e0e-23e3-2f6b-4068e9dae4cb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1944–1983.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rename {M : Expr S} (h : Normal M) (ρ : Nat → Nat) :
    Normal (M.rename ρ) := by
  induction M generalizing ρ with
  | var n => exact Normal.var _
  | sort s => exact Normal.sort _
  | pi A B ihA ihB => exact (ihA h.pi_domain ρ).pi (ihB h.pi_body _)
  | lam A b ihA ihb => exact (ihA h.lam_domain ρ).lam (ihb h.lam_body _)
  | app f a ihf iha =>
      have hf := ihf h.app_left ρ
      have ha := iha h.app_right ρ
      cases f with
      | lam D b => exact False.elim (h _ (.head D b a))
      | var n | sort s | app f b | pi D B =>
          intro N hN
          cases hN with
          | app_left hr => exact hf _ hr
          | app_right hr => exact ha _ hr

Concrete intended PTS for the independent weak-normalization premise.
`false` is the base type and `true` its kind. This has actual product formation,
legal lambdas and beta reductions. The full system-wide WN proposition remains
unproved; these fixtures do not discharge it.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/IndependentCore/Variantb8713a43fd4552cfcc3db940da0e8d52438b8cdd63a36f74581e1e98a8064860.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/IndependentCore/Variantb8713a43fd4552cfcc3db940da0e8d52438b8cdd63a36f74581e1e98a8064860.lean#L1944).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb94fd0dd3480169ef53bd8bba3ae8ec2131f268` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
