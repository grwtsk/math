## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:46f40f81-5252-a2a6-6f4a-a8284fc7f7ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2430–2439.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lookup_decoded {context : List (Expr Bool)} {index : Nat} {type : Expr Bool}
    (lookup : Lookup context index type) :
    (context.map decodeArrow)[index]? = some (decodeArrow type) := by
  induction lookup with
  | zero declared context => simp only [List.map_cons, List.getElem?_cons_zero, decode_rename]
  | succ declared lookup ih =>
      simpa only [List.map_cons, List.getElem?_cons_succ, decode_rename] using ih

/-- Conversion to a grammar type forces the actual valid-context declaration
to be that same grammar type, even for arbitrary source contexts. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/IndependentCore/Variantd179bb5d04446aa8f44a5c5ff2764540825a28e97f28f955c8216114bfe0ce4d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/IndependentCore/Variantd179bb5d04446aa8f44a5c5ff2764540825a28e97f28f955c8216114bfe0ce4d.lean#L2430).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ba85b83b99a40044ee429d8a1455adf5d6827d60` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
