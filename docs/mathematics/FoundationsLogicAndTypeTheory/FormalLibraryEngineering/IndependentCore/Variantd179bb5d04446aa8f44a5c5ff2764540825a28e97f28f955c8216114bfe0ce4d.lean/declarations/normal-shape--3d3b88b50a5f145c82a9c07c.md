## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:948609fb-82d9-dff6-1e5c-9c59df5f412e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1595–1610.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem normal_shape {M T : Expr S} (h : HasType P Γ M T) (hn : Normal M) :
    (∃ s, M = .sort s) ∨ Neutral M ∨ (∃ A B, M = .pi A B) ∨
      (∃ A b, M = .lam A b) := by
  induction M generalizing T with
  | var n => exact .inr (.inl (.var n))
  | sort s => exact .inl ⟨s, rfl⟩
  | lam A b ihA ihb => exact .inr (.inr (.inr ⟨A, b, rfl⟩))
  | pi A B ihA ihB => exact .inr (.inr (.inl ⟨A, B, rfl⟩))
  | app f a ihf iha =>
      obtain ⟨D, E, hf, ha, hc⟩ := h.generation_app
      obtain ⟨s, rfl⟩ | hnf | ⟨A, B, rfl⟩ | ⟨A, b, rfl⟩ := ihf hf hn.app_left
      · exact False.elim hf.sort_cannot_have_product_type
      · exact .inr (.inl (.app hnf))
      · exact False.elim hf.product_cannot_have_product_type
      · exact False.elim (hn _ (.head A b a))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/IndependentCore/Variantd179bb5d04446aa8f44a5c5ff2764540825a28e97f28f955c8216114bfe0ce4d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/IndependentCore/Variantd179bb5d04446aa8f44a5c5ff2764540825a28e97f28f955c8216114bfe0ce4d.lean#L1595).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ba85b83b99a40044ee429d8a1455adf5d6827d60` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
