## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:de7c80853efa49a39e8e18077695b6911f903782020234868a10fa19c6d60fba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 99–135.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def findGoalOfPatt (gs : List MVarId)
    (tag : TSyntax ``binderIdent) (patt? : Option Term) (renameI : TSyntaxArray `Lean.binderIdent) :
    TacticM (MVarId × List MVarId × List MVarId) :=
  Term.withoutErrToSorry do
    let fgs ← match tag with
      | `(binderIdent|$tag:ident) => filterTag gs tag.getId
      | _ => pure gs
    for g in fgs do
      let gs := gs.erase g
      if let some patt := patt? then
        let s ← saveState
        try
          let g ← renameInaccessibles g renameI
          -- Make a copy of `g` so that we don't assign type hints to `g` if we don't need to.
          let gCopy ← g.withContext <| mkFreshExprSyntheticOpaqueMVar (← g.getType) (← g.getTag)
          let g' :: gs' ← run gCopy.mvarId! <| withoutRecover <|
                            evalTactic (← `(tactic| refine_lift show $patt from ?_))
            | throwNoGoalsToBeSolved -- This should not happen
          -- Avoid assigning the type hint if the original type and the new type are
          -- defeq at reducible transparency.
          if ← g.withContext <| withReducible <| isDefEq (← g.getType) (← g'.getType) then
            g.assign (.mvar g')
          else
            g.assign gCopy
          return (g', gs', gs)
        catch _ =>
          restoreState s
      else
        let g ← renameInaccessibles g renameI
        return (g, [], gs)
    throwError "No goals with tag {tag} unify with the term {patt?.getD (← `(_))}, {
                ""}or too many names provided for renaming {
                ""}inaccessible variables."

/-- Given a `casePattBody`, either give a synthetic hole or a tactic sequence
(along with the syntax for the `=>`).
Converts holes into synthetic holes since they are processed with `elabTermWithHoles`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Case/Variant0ddb32e766faa895d9d9058026b7bbb1637a64d23bbb1153084436c5e54ce107.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Case/Variant0ddb32e766faa895d9d9058026b7bbb1637a64d23bbb1153084436c5e54ce107.lean#L99).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `906458e106ecb7ed6c9dab6705aa79cc9bf17b65` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
