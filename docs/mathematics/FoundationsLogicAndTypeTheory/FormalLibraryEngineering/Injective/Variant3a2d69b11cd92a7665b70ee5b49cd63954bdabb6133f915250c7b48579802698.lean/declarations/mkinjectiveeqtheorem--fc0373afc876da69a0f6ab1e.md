## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:90d17971f239cfa40f3c19450c4ae282849749b3113b8c7f1be8df8e88387d43`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 173–194.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def mkInjectiveEqTheorem (ctorVal : ConstructorVal) : MetaM Unit := do
  let name := mkInjectiveEqTheoremNameFor ctorVal.name
  withTraceNode `Meta.injective (msg := (fun _ => return m!"generating `{name}`")) do
  let some type ← mkInjectiveEqTheoremType? ctorVal
    | return ()
  trace[Meta.injective] "type: {type}"
  let value ← mkInjectiveEqTheoremValue ctorVal type
  addDecl <| Declaration.thmDecl {
    name
    levelParams := ctorVal.levelParams
    type        := (← instantiateMVars type)
    value       := (← instantiateMVars value)
  }
  addSimpTheorem (ext := simpExtension) name (post := true) (inv := false) AttributeKind.global (prio := eval_prio default)

register_builtin_option genInjectivity : Bool := {
  defValue := true
  descr    := "generate injectivity theorems for inductive datatype constructors. \
    Temporarily (for bootstrapping reasons) also controls the generation of the
    `ctorIdx` definition."
}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Injective/Variant3a2d69b11cd92a7665b70ee5b49cd63954bdabb6133f915250c7b48579802698.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Injective/Variant3a2d69b11cd92a7665b70ee5b49cd63954bdabb6133f915250c7b48579802698.lean#L173).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `987cba36eb760d71ed21511bd294cf9bd188845b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
