## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:23f47240-9601-47b1-1cbc-a8d11643aeb5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 203–212.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem bind_defined {α β γ} (p : Set α) {f : α →. β} {g : β → α →. γ} (H1 : p ⊆ f.Dom)
    (H2 : ∀ x, p ⊆ (g x).Dom) : p ⊆ (f >>= g).Dom := fun a ha =>
  (⟨H1 ha, H2 _ ha⟩ : (f >>= g).Dom a)

/-- First return map. Transforms a partial function `f : α →. β ⊕ α` into the partial function
`α →. β` which sends `a : α` to the first value in `β` it hits by iterating `f`, if such a value
exists. By abusing notation to illustrate, either `f a` is in the `β` part of `β ⊕ α` (in which
case `f.fix a` returns `f a`), or it is undefined (in which case `f.fix a` is undefined as well), or
it is in the `α` part of `β ⊕ α` (in which case we repeat the procedure, so `f.fix a` will return
`f.fix (f a)`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PFun/Variant14d485a88bfbc40c2267678231a7fb3b6df27f27e5c4f55d499c4fd3b89eae6a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PFun/Variant14d485a88bfbc40c2267678231a7fb3b6df27f27e5c4f55d499c4fd3b89eae6a.lean#L203).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e0454d970c95632d0c41e45b7ffeed8f29d7f6c7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
