## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:86f83107be7194a236c8710a2955ff197730c87376a44630fd3f92ea3c51c899`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 425–437.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def withoutCommandIncrementality (cond : Bool) (act : CommandElabM α) : CommandElabM α := do
  let opts ← getOptions
  -- Cancel old elaboration when discarding it (for commands without incrementality support)
  if cond then
    if let some old := (← read).snap?.bind (·.old?) then
      old.val.cancelRec
  withReader (fun ctx => { ctx with snap? := ctx.snap?.filter fun snap => Id.run do
    if let some old := snap.old? then
      if cond && opts.getBool `trace.Elab.reuse then
        dbg_trace "reuse stopped: guard failed at {old.stx}"
    return !cond
  }) act

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Command/Variant144be283be181e428cada561e868552bef3d8af17354965e4cf96916074c3140.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Command/Variant144be283be181e428cada561e868552bef3d8af17354965e4cf96916074c3140.lean#L425).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `112bf0606c1b16af59d7953c32ac7959b6508ced` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
