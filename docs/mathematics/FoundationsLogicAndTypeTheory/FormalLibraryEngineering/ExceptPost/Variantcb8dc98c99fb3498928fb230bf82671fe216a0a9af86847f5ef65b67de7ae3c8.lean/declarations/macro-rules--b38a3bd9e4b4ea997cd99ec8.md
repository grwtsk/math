## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `macro_rules` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a9a2d6d6aa6346bb30eb23a27e06984b41dba9fe02e6be8de5d810e90307ddd4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 140–148.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
macro_rules
  | `(EPost⟨⟩) => `(EPost.Nil)
  | `(EPost⟨$x⟩) => `(EPost.Cons $x EPost.Nil)
  | `(EPost⟨$x, $xs,*⟩) => `(EPost.Cons $x EPost⟨$xs,*⟩)
  | `(epost⟨⟩) => `(EPost.Nil.mk)
  | `(epost⟨$x⟩) => `(EPost.Cons.mk $x EPost.Nil.mk)
  | `(epost⟨$x, $xs,*⟩) => `(EPost.Cons.mk $x epost⟨$xs,*⟩)

/-- Pretty-print `EPost.Nil` as `EPost⟨⟩`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExceptPost/Variantcb8dc98c99fb3498928fb230bf82671fe216a0a9af86847f5ef65b67de7ae3c8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExceptPost/Variantcb8dc98c99fb3498928fb230bf82671fe216a0a9af86847f5ef65b67de7ae3c8.lean#L140).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8e2cb89a4faef91d76ef50cf3ee07f4ec1caa0a1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
