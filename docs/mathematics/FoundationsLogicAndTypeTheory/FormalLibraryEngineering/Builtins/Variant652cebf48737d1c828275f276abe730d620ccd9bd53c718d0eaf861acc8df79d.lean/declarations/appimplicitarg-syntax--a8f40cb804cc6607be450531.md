## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:40ec11bd3bf8caa77669e8d68ab8aa754360475167ee3602451bc3a9b2d5a26f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 357–371.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def AppImplicitArg.syntax? : AppImplicitArg → Option Syntax
  | .skip => none
  | .regular s => s
  | .optional _ s => s
  | .named s => s

/--
Delaborates a function application in the standard mode, where implicit arguments are generally not
included, unless `pp.analysis.namedArg` is set at that argument.

This delaborator is where `app_unexpander`s and the structure instance unexpander are applied, if `unexpand` is true.
When `unexpand` is true, also considers opportunities for field notation, which takes priority over other unexpanders.

Assumes `numArgs ≤ paramKinds.size`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Builtins/Variant652cebf48737d1c828275f276abe730d620ccd9bd53c718d0eaf861acc8df79d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Builtins/Variant652cebf48737d1c828275f276abe730d620ccd9bd53c718d0eaf861acc8df79d.lean#L357).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3a43e15944e75cf221e11cb3e1100a21e4476b87` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
