## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fcae7ae3e12c912be7ab04c48779c5670774b3fb4ad6ac7103efe45927ab6a50`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 283–296.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def certSumFromStep
    (lo : ℕ) (f : Q(ℕ → $α))
    (headCert tailCert : CertM rα (Cert rα)) : CertM rα (Cert rα) := do
  let ctx ← read
  unless lo < ctx.dimension do
    throwError "certSumFromStep called with {lo} such that ¬ {lo} < {ctx.dimension}"
  have dim : Q(ℕ) := ctx.dimensionLit
  let hLt : Q($lo < $dim) ← mkDecideProofQ q($lo < $dim)
  let sumCert ← certAdd (← headCert) (← tailCert)
  return sumCert.chainProof q(BirdDet.sumFrom_step $dim $lo $f $hLt)

mutual

/-- Certify an entry of `(BirdDet.stepEntry n A)^[t] (BirdDet.get n A)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Cert/Variant2250e2c4962c91707039b731d6fc80081cd66a165502b5568846e5cb3914366d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Cert/Variant2250e2c4962c91707039b731d6fc80081cd66a165502b5568846e5cb3914366d.lean#L283).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `32791bfa14c8e9c4e7d2513d80e43c248636dbb2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
