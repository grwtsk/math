## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c36b3dce-3481-d8fe-2e5b-058a6c9a2263`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 805–815.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem good_normal_read (hC : IsComponent (PrimaryEdge P) C)
    {Γ : List (Expr S)} {M : Expr S} {s r : S} (t : TypingTree P Γ M (.sort s))
    (t' : TypingTree P Γ M.normalForm (.sort r))
    (e : Environment (hw := hw) Ω C hno Γ) (hg : ReadGood Ω C t e.images) :
    (preEvaluate Ω C hno t e).read.val = (preEvaluate Ω C hno t' e).read.val := by
  obtain ⟨tn,htn⟩ := normalize_transport Ω C hno hC t
  have hn := (Expr.normalForm_spec (t.typing.weaklyNormalizing hw)).2
  exact (htn.read e hg).2.trans ((normal_tree_independence Ω C hno tn hn t' e).2 s r rfl rfl)
end PureTypeSystem.ObservationValues

end OAI
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ObservationReduction/Variant92b1466e7f4750484c00ac68c1cf7f6ab5247077fdb4ae5a463a1b2ef6a20143.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ObservationReduction/Variant92b1466e7f4750484c00ac68c1cf7f6ab5247077fdb4ae5a463a1b2ef6a20143.lean#L805).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3083cf86771e4628de8f5aac5999317f4f8d9520` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
