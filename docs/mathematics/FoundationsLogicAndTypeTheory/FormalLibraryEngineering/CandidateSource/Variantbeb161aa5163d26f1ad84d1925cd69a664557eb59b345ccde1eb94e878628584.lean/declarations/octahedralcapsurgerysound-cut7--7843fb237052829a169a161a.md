## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0bd56f0a-394e-ecc0-eea4-408dbcc04c4c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–129.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem octahedralCapSurgerySound_cut7 :
    OctahedralCapSurgerySound 7 := by
  refine ⟨rfl, ?_⟩
  intro edge
  cases edge with
  | xy xSign ySign => cases xSign <;> cases ySign <;> rfl
  | xz xSign zSign => cases xSign <;> cases zSign <;> rfl
  | yz ySign zSign => cases ySign <;> cases zSign <;> rfl

end Surface.Core.TopologySurgeryGame
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CandidateSource/Variantbeb161aa5163d26f1ad84d1925cd69a664557eb59b345ccde1eb94e878628584.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CandidateSource/Variantbeb161aa5163d26f1ad84d1925cd69a664557eb59b345ccde1eb94e878628584.lean#L120).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
