## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7481cdcb-c4d7-f13c-4391-c56bc9f3e849`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 212–221.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem of_normalize_eq {f g f' : a ⟶ b} {η θ : f ≅ g} (η_f : 𝟙 a ≫ f ≅ f') (η_g : 𝟙 a ≫ g ≅ f')
    (h_η : 𝟙 a ◁ η ≪≫ η_g = η_f)
    (h_θ : 𝟙 a ◁ θ ≪≫ η_g = η_f) : η = θ := by
  apply Iso.ext
  calc
    η.hom = (λ_ f).inv ≫ η_f.hom ≫ η_g.inv ≫ (λ_ g).hom := by
      simp [← reassoc_of% (congrArg Iso.hom h_η)]
    _ = θ.hom := by
      simp [← reassoc_of% (congrArg Iso.hom h_θ)]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PureCoherence/Variant5722cc790a27a9680b95c1b95d8e85b2bbf7f6671c293d323c221e3e4ae5e1bf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PureCoherence/Variant5722cc790a27a9680b95c1b95d8e85b2bbf7f6671c293d323c221e3e4ae5e1bf.lean#L212).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b7d5b211a04788541ef8d2d406c78efae1f0f630` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
