## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d41fabb257a424483f4af77ab271365e33a8858ad051bca0391fec9900e80246`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 701–720.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def internalizeToIntTerm (e type : Expr) : GoalM Unit := do
  if (← isToIntTerm e) then return () -- already internalized
  if let some (eToInt, he) ← toInt? e type then
    trace[grind.debug.lia.internalize] "{e} : {type}"
    trace[grind.debug.lia.toInt] "{e} ==> {eToInt}"
    let α := type
    modify' fun s => { s with
      toIntTermMap := s.toIntTermMap.insert { expr := e } { eToInt, he, α }
    }
    cutsatExt.markTerm e

/--
Internalizes an integer (and `Nat`) expression. Here are the different cases that are handled.

- `a + b` when `parent?` is not `+`, `≤`, or `∣`
- `k * a` when `k` is a numeral and `parent?` is not `+`, `*`, `≤`, `∣`
- numerals when `parent?` is not `+`, `*`, `≤`, `∣`.
  Recall that we must internalize numerals to make sure we can propagate equalities
  back to the congruence closure module. Example: we have `f 5`, `f x`, `x - y = 3`, `y = 2`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/EqCnstr/Variantb4b592c37a45d4e0364142ee9019ae48038a3eb25f9b120ae3936e8e1a4df205.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/EqCnstr/Variantb4b592c37a45d4e0364142ee9019ae48038a3eb25f9b120ae3936e8e1a4df205.lean#L701).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bfc33f2c395a87402e7796b548588f6a687c8303` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
