## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:999acd377f2f04184fe9643775f70e8caa4a3978bb08d4cf3680b83b7f54b37b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 392–410.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def applyStarArg (ctx : Simp.Context) : MetaM Simp.Context := do
  let mut simpTheorems := ctx.simpTheorems
  /-
  When using `zetaDelta := false`, we do not expand let-declarations when using `[*]`.
  Users must explicitly include it in the list.
  -/
  let hs ← getPropHyps
  for h in hs do
    unless simpTheorems.isErased (.fvar h) do
      simpTheorems ← simpTheorems.addTheorem (.fvar h) (← h.getDecl).toExpr (config := ctx.indexConfig)
  return ctx.setSimpTheorems simpTheorems

/--
  Elaborate extra simp theorems provided to `simp`. `stx` is of the form `"[" simpTheorem,* "]"`
  If `eraseLocal == true`, then we consider local declarations when resolving names for erased theorems (`- id`),
  this option only makes sense for `simp_all` or `*` is used.
  When `recover := true`, try to recover from errors as much as possible so that users keep seeing
  the current goal.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Simp/Variant2511ae4a4ffce7a9e225efd32b03bea0aa0025dae37493c474daa532df023639.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Simp/Variant2511ae4a4ffce7a9e225efd32b03bea0aa0025dae37493c474daa532df023639.lean#L392).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cffbc13f8248bf6f6ddb2b9cedae8af638ab4c0b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
