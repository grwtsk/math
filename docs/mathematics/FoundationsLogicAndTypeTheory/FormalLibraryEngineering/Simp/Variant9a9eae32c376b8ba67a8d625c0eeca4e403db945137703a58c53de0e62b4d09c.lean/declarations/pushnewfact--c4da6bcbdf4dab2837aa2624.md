## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2f22c9b0bb05b307abd2249179f9caa0aa4fe8a1cac9cbc7ffca7e115a8d73f1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–90.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def pushNewFact' (prop : Expr) (proof : Expr) (generation : Nat := 0) : GoalM Unit := do
  let r ← preprocess prop
  let prop' := r.expr
  let proof := if let some h := r.proof? then
    mkApp4 (mkConst ``Eq.mp [Level.zero]) prop prop' h proof
  else
    proof
  trace[grind.debug.pushNewFact] "{prop} ==> {prop'}"
  modify fun s => { s with newFacts := s.newFacts.push <| .fact prop' proof generation }


/-- Infers the type of the proof, preprocess it, and adds it to todo list. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Simp/Variant9a9eae32c376b8ba67a8d625c0eeca4e403db945137703a58c53de0e62b4d09c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Simp/Variant9a9eae32c376b8ba67a8d625c0eeca4e403db945137703a58c53de0e62b4d09c.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `309563b89dc22a2ec2eddc4a4dede051ec96297b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
