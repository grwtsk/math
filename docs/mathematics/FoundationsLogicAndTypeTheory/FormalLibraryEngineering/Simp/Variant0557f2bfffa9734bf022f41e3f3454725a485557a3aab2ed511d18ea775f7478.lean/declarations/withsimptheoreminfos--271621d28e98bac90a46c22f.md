## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:643188dcff3584fe96e39ca0e1b20d234eb22dbc49bdd2081c7eddab9ab44d1a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 49–59.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def withSimpTheoremInfos (ty : Expr) (k : SimpTheoremInfo → MetaM α) : MetaM (Array α) :=
  withReducible do
    let e ← preprocess (← mkSorry ty true) ty (inv := false) (isGlobal := true)
    e.toArray.mapM fun (_, ty') => do
      forallTelescopeReducing ty' fun hyps eq => do
        let some (_, lhs, rhs) := eq.eq? | throwError "not an equality {eq}"
        let isConditional ← isConditionalHyps lhs hyps.toList
        k { hyps, lhs, rhs, isConditional }

/-- Checks whether two expressions are equal for the simplifier. That is,
they are reducibly-definitional equal, and they have the same head symbol. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Simp/Variant0557f2bfffa9734bf022f41e3f3454725a485557a3aab2ed511d18ea775f7478.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Simp/Variant0557f2bfffa9734bf022f41e3f3454725a485557a3aab2ed511d18ea775f7478.lean#L49).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `525107e8031f6a066c6257d60ed3e280f4c3f5a6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
