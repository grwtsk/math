## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:91866dc75941fa760f54e5b9f8d8832b399de6f46122fb8a6e43edde6ddeaeb5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private partial def levelEncoding (params : List Name) : Level → String
  | .zero => node "zero"
  | .succ level => node "succ" #[levelEncoding params level]
  | .max left right => node "max" #[levelEncoding params left, levelEncoding params right]
  | .imax left right => node "imax" #[levelEncoding params left, levelEncoding params right]
  | .param name =>
      match parameterPosition? params name with
      | some position => node "param" #[toString position]
      | none => node "unresolvedParam" #[name.toString]
  | .mvar id => node "levelMVar" #[reprStr id]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LeanEnvironmentExtract/Variante746c61ea33d9fb24d246041110422dae4e07254dc7363ef553cb5e3c309813a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LeanEnvironmentExtract/Variante746c61ea33d9fb24d246041110422dae4e07254dc7363ef553cb5e3c309813a.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `488b94ca640a7e8956f9cfdaf2788d506cc128b7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
