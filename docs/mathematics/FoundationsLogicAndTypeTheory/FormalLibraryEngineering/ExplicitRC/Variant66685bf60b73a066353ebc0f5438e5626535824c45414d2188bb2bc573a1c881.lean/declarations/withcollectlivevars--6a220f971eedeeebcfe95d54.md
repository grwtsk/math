## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0a5ee24b993a836d48578049adf353910a57b0548b2cb23d27b61bd6cdc4b417`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 324–337.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def withCollectLiveVars (x : RcM α) : RcM (α × LiveVars) := do
  let currentLiveVars := (← get).liveVars
  modifyLive fun _ => {}
  let ret ← x
  let collected := (← get).liveVars
  modifyLive fun _ => currentLiveVars
  return (ret, collected)

/--
Traverse the transitive closure of values derived from `fvarId` and add them to `s` if:
- they pass `shouldAdd`.
- all their parents are accessible
-/
@[specialize]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExplicitRC/Variant66685bf60b73a066353ebc0f5438e5626535824c45414d2188bb2bc573a1c881.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExplicitRC/Variant66685bf60b73a066353ebc0f5438e5626535824c45414d2188bb2bc573a1c881.lean#L324).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fccd73159010e91632d3e5eb7c9381f8b9a829b3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
