## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8c12bb7517273b3df4d8ed69440d34e679799c12a70bcd96528c6868e9c24091`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 123–142.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getBestLower? (x : Var) (dvd? : Option DvdCnstr) : GoalM (Option (Rat × LeCnstr)) := do
  let s ← get'
  let mut best? := none
  for c in s.lowers[x]! do
    let c ← tightUsingDvd c dvd?
    let .add k _ p := c.p | c.throwUnexpected
    let some v ← p.eval? | c.throwUnexpected
    let lower' := v / (-k)
    if let some (lower, _) := best? then
      if lower' > lower then
        best? := some (lower', c)
    else
      best? := some (lower', c)
  return best?

/--
Assuming all variables smaller than `x` have already been assigned,
returns the best upper bound for `x` using the given partial assignment and
inequality constraints where `x` is the maximal variable.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Search/Variant75f9186d121b596e64c7187fb14368839d96d91128486174150a40faa3875260.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Search/Variant75f9186d121b596e64c7187fb14368839d96d91128486174150a40faa3875260.lean#L123).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `406b2fd17976e810aa68e4962d194e597daaf13f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
