## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:587f19fb-80cd-4fa5-0509-5509069c13f8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 481–498.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    ∃ k, ∀ n A, Lookup Γ n A →
      PureTypeSystem.HasType P (Ω.context k) ((σ n).rename (Expr.reverseIndex k))
        ((A.subst σ).rename (Expr.reverseIndex k)) := by
  induction Γ generalizing σ with
  | nil => exact ⟨0, fun _ _ hn => nomatch hn⟩
  | cons B Γ ih =>

      obtain ⟨m, hm⟩ := h 0 (B.rename Nat.succ) (.zero B Γ)
      refine ⟨max k m, ?_⟩
      intro n A hn
      cases hn with
      | zero => exact Ω.at_mono hm (le_max_right k m)
      | succ B hn =>
          have hh := Ω.at_mono (hk _ _ hn) (le_max_left k m)
          simpa only [Expr.subst_rename, Function.comp_apply] using hh

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Contexts/Variant55a6300af548e011771c138e446a807106442fa81fb68e5254597de839009561.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Contexts/Variant55a6300af548e011771c138e446a807106442fa81fb68e5254597de839009561.lean#L481).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c9128b4afc20b13f1e3df9a9c02acefa5ea4f722` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
