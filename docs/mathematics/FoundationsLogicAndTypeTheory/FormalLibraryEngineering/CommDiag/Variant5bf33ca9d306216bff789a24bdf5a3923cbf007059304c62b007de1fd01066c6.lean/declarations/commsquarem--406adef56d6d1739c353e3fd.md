## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6d19621b332f33ae5580d647452f50ffb7a56471f28b35b260f181d827db5cee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 119–131.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def commSquareM? (e : Expr) : MetaM (Option Html) := do
  let e ← instantiateMVars e
  let some (_, lhs, rhs) := e.eq? | return none
  let some (f, g) := homComp? lhs | return none
  let some (i, h) := homComp? rhs | return none
  let some (A, B) := homType? (← inferType f) | return none
  let some (D, C) := homType? (← inferType h) | return none
  some <$> mkCommDiag subSquare
    #[("A", A), ("B", B), ("C", C), ("D", D),
      ("f", f), ("g", g), ("h", h), ("i", i)]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CommDiag/Variant5bf33ca9d306216bff789a24bdf5a3923cbf007059304c62b007de1fd01066c6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CommDiag/Variant5bf33ca9d306216bff789a24bdf5a3923cbf007059304c62b007de1fd01066c6.lean#L119).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `abd2ed23e564526ffd971d06f1164962d4411fb9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
