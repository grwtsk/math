## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dd482bee-ce02-aa49-ab94-b4253d3d7beb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 857–872.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pair_right_forward {v a x : Expr S}
    (hv : HasType P Γ v B.predType) (mv : WellModed γ v .data)
    (ha : HasType P Γ a B.yType) (ma : WellModed γ a .data)
    (hx : HasType P Γ x B.xType) (mx : WellModed γ x .data)
    (hp : Proves P Γ γ (B.ev (B.pair L.code KY.code KP.code v a) (B.observation.tagged L.code
      2 x))) :
    Proves P Γ γ (B.relation L.code KY.code KP.code a (B.observation.tagged L.code 0 x)) := by
  have ht := H.observation.tagged_typed 2 hx mx
  have fp := L.ex_formula KY H.y_sorted H.y_mode (H.formExBody_family KY KP hv mv ht.1 ht.2)
  have fq := H.edge_formula KY KP true ha ma ht.1 ht.2
  have hp' := (H.pair_evaluation KY KP hv mv ha ma ht.1 ht.2).1.prove hp
  rw [H.pairForm_eq KY KP] at hp'
  have he := L.select_disj_right fp fp fq fq fp.equivalent_refl fq.equivalent_refl hp'
    (H.formEx_right_false KY KP hv mv hx mx)
  exact H.edge_to_tagged KY KP true ha ma hx mx he

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Diagonal/Variantc9ea1d2b83158c4c4ea67cf3b33232c4ded13d95ff0d5c8cb754671e8e33fef9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Diagonal/Variantc9ea1d2b83158c4c4ea67cf3b33232c4ded13d95ff0d5c8cb754671e8e33fef9.lean#L857).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `12dfb80e98a16c6de90537c08dfb0314cf6ab688` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
