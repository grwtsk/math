## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:68e39a34c0efee9e523b9b65bf427ecee5be94726e993d1fa38d1b49b20b8c73`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 41–70.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkCalcTrans (result resultType step stepType : Expr) : MetaM (Expr × Expr) := do
  let some (r, a, b) ← getCalcRelation? resultType | unreachable!
  let some (s, _, c) ← getCalcRelation? (← instantiateMVars stepType) | unreachable!
  let u ← getRelUniv r
  let v ← getRelUniv s
  let (α, β, γ)       := (← inferType a, ← inferType b, ← inferType c)
  let (u_1, u_2, u_3) := (← getLevel α, ← getLevel β, ← getLevel γ)
  let w ← mkFreshLevelMVar
  let t ← mkFreshExprMVar (← mkArrow α (← mkArrow γ (mkSort w)))
  let selfType := mkAppN (Lean.mkConst ``Trans [u, v, w, u_1, u_2, u_3]) #[α, β, γ, r, s, t]
  match (← trySynthInstance selfType) with
  | .some self =>
    let result := mkAppN (Lean.mkConst ``Trans.trans [u, v, w, u_1, u_2, u_3]) #[α, β, γ, r, s, t, self, a, b, c, result, step]
    let resultType := (← instantiateMVars (← inferType result)).headBeta
    unless (← getCalcRelation? resultType).isSome do
      throwError "invalid 'calc' step, step result is not a relation{indentExpr resultType}"
    return (result, resultType)
  | _ => throwError "invalid 'calc' step, failed to synthesize `Trans` instance{indentExpr selfType}{useDiagnosticMsg}"

/--
Adds a type annotation to a hole that occurs immediately at the beginning of the term.
This is so that coercions can trigger when elaborating the term.
See https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/2040 for further rationale.

- `_ < 3` is annotated
- `(_) < 3` is not, because it occurs after an atom
- in `_ < _` only the first one is annotated
- `_ + 2 < 3` is annotated (not the best heuristic, ideally we'd like to annotate `_ + 2`)
- `lt _ 3` is not, because it occurs after an identifier

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Calc/Variant24c3af83dc3474bc9d39b405ee22fa20d3a989edd48a9d417d88b399f2c9c8d1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Calc/Variant24c3af83dc3474bc9d39b405ee22fa20d3a989edd48a9d417d88b399f2c9c8d1.lean#L41).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `470686476a2289f65e2025cbe6bed7e7962b13f0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
