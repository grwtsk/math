## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3b576c6af8410a567171b7f3d7695502c757d3f626083f6e505df64024a2f8b4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 136–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive EtaStructMode where
  /-- Enable eta for structure and classes. -/
  | all
  /-- Enable eta only for structures that are not classes. -/
  | notClasses
  /-- Disable eta for structures and classes. -/
  | none
  deriving Inhabited, BEq

namespace DSimp

/--
The configuration for `dsimp`.
Passed to `dsimp` using, for example, the `dsimp (config := {zeta := false})` syntax.

Implementation note: this structure is only used for processing the `(config := ...)` syntax, and it is not used internally.
It is immediately converted to `Lean.Meta.Simp.Config` by `Lean.Elab.Tactic.elabSimpConfig`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MetaTypes/Variant6ce9ae712999c2b8837cd19a66a262023b31fc0530bb2fd822871d25173cfc7d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MetaTypes/Variant6ce9ae712999c2b8837cd19a66a262023b31fc0530bb2fd822871d25173cfc7d.lean#L136).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9dc60f9b32862069489bef92c22b3f02cc97a3e8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
