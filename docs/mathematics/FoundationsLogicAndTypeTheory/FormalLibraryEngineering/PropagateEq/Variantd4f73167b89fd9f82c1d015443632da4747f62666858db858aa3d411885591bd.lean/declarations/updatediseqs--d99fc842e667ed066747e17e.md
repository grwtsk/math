## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fd079dc7b92a234f86ec56ed50f5ac3ff84094a52b26cd4aacbdcd02c65c5c42`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 180–191.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def updateDiseqs (a : Int) (x : Var) (c : EqCnstr) (y : Var) : LinearM Unit := do
  if (← inconsistent) then return ()
  let (diseqs', todo) := splitDiseqs x (← getStruct).diseqs[y]!
  modifyStruct fun s => { s with diseqs := s.diseqs.set y diseqs' }
  for (b, c₂) in todo do
    if let some c₂ ← c₂.applyEq? a x c b then
      c₂.assert
      if (← inconsistent) then return ()
    else
      -- Failed to eliminate
      c₂.ignore

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PropagateEq/Variantd4f73167b89fd9f82c1d015443632da4747f62666858db858aa3d411885591bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PropagateEq/Variantd4f73167b89fd9f82c1d015443632da4747f62666858db858aa3d411885591bd.lean#L180).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `afae9268d0af13465baa43996ca42bdb21f2bbb6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
