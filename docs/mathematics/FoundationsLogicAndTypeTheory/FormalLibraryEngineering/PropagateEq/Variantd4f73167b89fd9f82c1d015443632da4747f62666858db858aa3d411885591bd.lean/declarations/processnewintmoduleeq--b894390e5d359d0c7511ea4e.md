## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a06c25c6c8e57704d942dde774c7f5eb57ce40d6483330b893f5a96ac1374919`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 78–88.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def processNewIntModuleEq' (a b : Expr) : LinearM Unit := do
  let some lhs ← reify? a (skipVar := false) (← getGeneration a) | return ()
  let some rhs ← reify? b (skipVar := false) (← getGeneration b) | return ()
  let p := (lhs.sub rhs).norm
  if p == .nil then return ()
  let c₁ : IneqCnstr := { p, strict := false, h := .ofEq a b lhs rhs }
  c₁.assert
  let p := p.mul (-1)
  let c₂ : IneqCnstr := { p, strict := false, h := .ofEq b a rhs lhs }
  c₂.assert

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PropagateEq/Variantd4f73167b89fd9f82c1d015443632da4747f62666858db858aa3d411885591bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PropagateEq/Variantd4f73167b89fd9f82c1d015443632da4747f62666858db858aa3d411885591bd.lean#L78).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `afae9268d0af13465baa43996ca42bdb21f2bbb6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
