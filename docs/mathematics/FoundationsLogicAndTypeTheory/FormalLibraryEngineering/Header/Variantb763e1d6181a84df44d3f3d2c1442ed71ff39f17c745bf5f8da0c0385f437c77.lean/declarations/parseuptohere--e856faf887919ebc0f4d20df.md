## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:69aa7c90e1aae3fe40bb3590f5b002aad71e5a9a1200a56d45ac0cf249284e2a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 99–106.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def parseUpToHere (pos : String.Pos) (post : String := "") : CommandElabM Syntax := do
  let upToHere : Substring := { str := (← getFileMap).source, startPos := ⟨0⟩, stopPos := pos }
  -- Append a further string after the content of `upToHere`.
  Parser.testParseModule (← getEnv) "linter.style.header" (upToHere.toString ++ post)

/-- `toSyntax s pattern` converts the two input strings into a `Syntax`, assuming that `pattern`
is a substring of `s`:
the syntax is an atom with value `pattern` whose the range is the range of `pattern` in `s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Header/Variantb763e1d6181a84df44d3f3d2c1442ed71ff39f17c745bf5f8da0c0385f437c77.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Header/Variantb763e1d6181a84df44d3f3d2c1442ed71ff39f17c745bf5f8da0c0385f437c77.lean#L99).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a86b3801096f9e9e4ccbc14812656a5ab5953baf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
