## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:653654dda9a1ad1acb7ad5e0ad3ee83a265d0ef0ef73374e5ca66d8d6682a9d4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 160–222.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  -- First, we merge lines ending in `,`: two spaces after the line-break are ok,
  -- but so is only one or none.  We take care of *not* adding more consecutive spaces, though.
  -- This is to allow the copyright or authors' lines to span several lines.
  let preprocessCopyright := (copyright.replace ",\n  " ", ").replace ",\n" ","
  -- Filter out everything after the first isolated `-/`.
  let pieces := preprocessCopyright.splitOn "\n-/"
  let copyright := (pieces.getD 0 "") ++ "\n-/"

    s!"Malformed or missing copyright header: `{s}` should be alone on its own line."
  let mut output := #[]

    else
    -- If the list of authors spans multiple lines, all but the last line should end with a trailing
    -- comma. This excludes e.g. other comments in the copyright header.

    let authorsStart := (("\n".intercalate [openComment, copyrightAuthor, license, ""])).endPos

/--
`isInMathlib modName` returns `true` if `Mathlib.lean` imports the file `modName` and `false`
otherwise.
This is used by the `Header` linter as a heuristic of whether it should inspect the file or not.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Header/Variant70dcdcd99b8f119785545b8d986e8141229b07fe66589e3645d6eafe352d8c37.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Header/Variant70dcdcd99b8f119785545b8d986e8141229b07fe66589e3645d6eafe352d8c37.lean#L160).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `01ad90dea8e75b614ed32388d6964b7620163a27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
