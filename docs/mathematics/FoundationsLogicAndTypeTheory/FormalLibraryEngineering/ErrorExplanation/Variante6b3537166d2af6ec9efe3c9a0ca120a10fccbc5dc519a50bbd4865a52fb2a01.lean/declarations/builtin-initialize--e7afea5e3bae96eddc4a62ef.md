## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `builtin_initialize` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:571744cfc1505e0d9f1877bf091093cb10a15a9f3a36d75e145c6857e8c64797`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 54–63.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
builtin_initialize errorExplanationExt : SimplePersistentEnvExtension (Name × ErrorExplanation) (NameMap ErrorExplanation) ←
  registerSimplePersistentEnvExtension {
    addEntryFn := fun s (n, v) => s.insert n v
    addImportedFn := fun ess =>
      ess.foldl (init := ∅) fun acc es =>
        es.foldl (init := acc) fun acc (n, v) =>
          acc.insert n v
  }

/-- Returns an error explanation for the given name if one exists. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ErrorExplanation/Variante6b3537166d2af6ec9efe3c9a0ca120a10fccbc5dc519a50bbd4865a52fb2a01.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ErrorExplanation/Variante6b3537166d2af6ec9efe3c9a0ca120a10fccbc5dc519a50bbd4865a52fb2a01.lean#L54).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `40a77bd489a8e0b1c5c282c376fd114d9c6b3170` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
