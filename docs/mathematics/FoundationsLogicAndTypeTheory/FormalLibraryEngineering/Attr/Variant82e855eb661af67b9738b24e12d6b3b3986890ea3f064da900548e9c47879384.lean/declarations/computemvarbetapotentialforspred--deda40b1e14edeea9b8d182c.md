## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2032e3e02be6e0b9c5cb12350c02ccc3517236cb62bea7df2c8a7b69d74dafd7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 162–187.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def computeMVarBetaPotentialForSPred (xs : Array Expr) (σs : Expr) (e : Expr) : MetaM Nat :=
  withNewMCtxDepth do
  withConfigWithKey simpSPredConfig do
  if xs.isEmpty then return 0
  let ctx ← Simp.Context.mkDefault
  let mut σs ← whnfR σs
  let mut e := e
  let mut n : Nat := 0
  let mut lastSuccess := 0
  let mut boundAssignments ← countBVarDependentMVars xs e
  while σs.isAppOfArity ``List.cons 3 do
    n := n+1
    let σ := σs.getArg! 1
    let s ← mkFreshExprMVar σ
    e := e.beta #[s]
    let (r, _) ← simp e ctx
      -- In practice we only need to reduce `fun s => ...` and `SPred.pure`.
      -- We could write a custom function should `simp` become a bottleneck.
    e := r.expr
    let count ← countBVarDependentMVars xs e
    if count < boundAssignments || e.getAppFn'.isMVar then
      lastSuccess := n
      boundAssignments := count
    σs ← whnfR (σs.getArg! 2)
  return lastSuccess

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Attr/Variant82e855eb661af67b9738b24e12d6b3b3986890ea3f064da900548e9c47879384.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Attr/Variant82e855eb661af67b9738b24e12d6b3b3986890ea3f064da900548e9c47879384.lean#L162).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7af6866c289dd6b6425486f17fdf675ce59a00ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
