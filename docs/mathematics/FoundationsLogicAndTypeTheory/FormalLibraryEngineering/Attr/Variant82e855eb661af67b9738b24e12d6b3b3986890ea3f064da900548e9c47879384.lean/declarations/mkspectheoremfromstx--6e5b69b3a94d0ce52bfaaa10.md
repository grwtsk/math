## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:676ebead91c7e17c3d372b578478dad7d8dfa5b69e28a6d6573f4e815e19d6fb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 488–501.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkSpecTheoremFromStx (ref : Syntax) (proof : Expr) (prio : Nat := eval_prio default) : MetaM (Option SpecTheorem) := do
  let type ← inferType proof
  mkSpecTheorem type (.stx (← mkFreshId) ref proof) prio

/--
Eta-expand a pattern for a function-level equation.

For unfold equations of class projections (e.g., `MonadState.modifyGet.eq_1`), the equation
may be between functions: `@modifyGet σ m self = self.3` of type `{α} → (σ → α × σ) → m α`.
The discrimination tree key includes the arg count, so lookup would fail if the pattern has
fewer args than the actual fully-applied program. This appends the leading forall domains of
`eqTy` to the pattern's variables and applies the new bound variables to the pattern expression.
Returns the eta-expanded pattern and the number of extra args (0 if no expansion needed).

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Attr/Variant82e855eb661af67b9738b24e12d6b3b3986890ea3f064da900548e9c47879384.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Attr/Variant82e855eb661af67b9738b24e12d6b3b3986890ea3f064da900548e9c47879384.lean#L488).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7af6866c289dd6b6425486f17fdf675ce59a00ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
