## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6402cebd-028c-68ec-acac-ff8cdd215c3f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_ofPred_eq {x : α} {p : α → Prop} : (x ∈ {y | p y}) = p x := rfl

@[deprecated (since := "2026-07-09")] alias mem_setOf_eq := mem_ofPred_eq

grind_pattern mem_ofPred_eq => x ∈ Set.ofPred p

/-- This lemma is intended for use with `rw` where a membership predicate is needed,
hence the explicit argument and the equality in the reverse direction from normal.
See also `Set.mem_ofPred_eq` for the reverse direction applied to an argument. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Operations/Variant60e5fa9adbd7d068a553d5a28875f5250e0a20771b5179f9f552882d0865c68e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Operations/Variant60e5fa9adbd7d068a553d5a28875f5250e0a20771b5179f9f552882d0865c68e.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f5d18fca655f6bf3079f859060f3738b5f2bc089` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
