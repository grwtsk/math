## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4894dc753d8467a4af6fbad09825e72cc53a1fa95c27a922c995a4d556a38473`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 84–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def takeName (ss : Substring.Raw) : (Substring.Raw × Name) :=
  let rec takeRest ss pre :=
    if ss.front == '.' then
      let startPos := ss.startPos
      let (ss, n) := takeNamePart (ss.drop 1) pre
      if n.isAnonymous then ({ss with startPos}, pre) else takeRest ss n
    else
      (ss, pre)
  let (ss, n) := takeNamePart ss .anonymous
  if n.isAnonymous then (ss, .anonymous) else takeRest ss n

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Toml/Varianta3a27e8d1f6f03b69ab1e4f1eb4896f9d6efc9d87832493880a401954c4f4efd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Toml/Varianta3a27e8d1f6f03b69ab1e4f1eb4896f9d6efc9d87832493880a401954c4f4efd.lean#L84).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `72bec3ce613b5650990c9aaa9b3e33c738ca28ec` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
