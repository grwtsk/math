## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3178169c36a81554bd8e666153a22e4920c856b4bfbf5edbd6552083ba0476da`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 75–95.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def localHypotheses (except : List FVarId := []) : MetaM (Array (Expr × Bool × Nat)) := do
  let r ← getLocalHyps
  let mut result := #[]
  for h in r do
    if except.contains h.fvarId! then continue
    let (_, _, type) ← forallMetaTelescopeReducing (← inferType h)
    match type.getAppFnArgs with
    | (``Eq, #[_, lhs, rhs])
    | (``Iff, #[lhs, rhs]) => do
      let lhsKey : Array (DiscrTree.Key true) ← DiscrTree.mkPath lhs
      let rhsKey : Array (DiscrTree.Key true) ← DiscrTree.mkPath rhs
      result := result.push (h, false, forwardWeight * lhsKey.size)
        |>.push (h, true, backwardWeight * rhsKey.size)
    | _ => pure ()
  return result

/-- Insert a lemma into the discrimination tree. -/
-- Recall that `rw?` caches the discrimination tree on disk.
-- If you are modifying this file, you will probably want to delete
-- `build/lib/MathlibExtras/Rewrites.extra`
-- so that the cache is rebuilt.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Rewrites/Variant150707fa5f25c70c5083eff4c578c657dd46c1fad99cc0d36088cc6525e1f239.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Rewrites/Variant150707fa5f25c70c5083eff4c578c657dd46c1fad99cc0d36088cc6525e1f239.lean#L75).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a3a16b14d71ff1cfe2d002be266de87cb60fe680` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
