## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1d4d319900f4be4a34f9c737926d65b13ad0ae77f02d7cf05ad6792ec7dbc65f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 156–176.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def RewriteResult.computeRfl (r : RewriteResult) : MetaM RewriteResult := do
  if let some _ := r.rfl? then
    return r
  try
    withoutModifyingState <| withMCtx r.mctx do
      -- We use `withReducible` here to follow the behaviour of `rw`.
      withReducible (← mkFreshExprMVar r.result.eNew).mvarId!.rfl
      -- We do not need to record the updated `MetavarContext` here.
      pure { r with rfl? := some true }
  catch _ =>
    pure { r with rfl? := some false }

/--
Find lemmas which can rewrite the goal.

This core function returns a monadic list, to allow the caller to decide how long to search.
See also `rewrites` for a more convenient interface.
-/
-- We need to supply the current `MetavarContext` (which will be reused for each lemma application)
-- because `MLList.squash` executes lazily,
-- so there is no opportunity for `← getMCtx` to record the context at the call site.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Rewrites/Variant150707fa5f25c70c5083eff4c578c657dd46c1fad99cc0d36088cc6525e1f239.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Rewrites/Variant150707fa5f25c70c5083eff4c578c657dd46c1fad99cc0d36088cc6525e1f239.lean#L156).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a3a16b14d71ff1cfe2d002be266de87cb60fe680` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
