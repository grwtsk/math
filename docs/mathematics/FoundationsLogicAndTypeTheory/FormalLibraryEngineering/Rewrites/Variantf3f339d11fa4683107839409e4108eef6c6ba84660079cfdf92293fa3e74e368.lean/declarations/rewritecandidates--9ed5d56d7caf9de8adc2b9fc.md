## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6f04fc8137a876e8ed5dae0a1392f4caf7859045637e8a738e6392456afcda35`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 249–281.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def rewriteCandidates (hyps : Array (Expr × Bool × Nat))
    (moduleRef : LazyDiscrTree.ModuleDiscrTreeRef (Name × RwDirection))
    (target : Expr)
    (forbidden : NameSet := ∅) :
    MetaM (Array ((Expr ⊕ Name) × Bool × Nat)) := do
  -- Get all lemmas which could match some subexpression
  let candidates ← getSubexpressionMatches (rwFindDecls moduleRef) target
  -- Sort them by our preferring weighting
  -- (length of discriminant key, doubled for the forward implication)
  let candidates := candidates.insertionSort fun (_, _, rp) (_, _, sp) => rp > sp

  -- Now deduplicate. We can't use `Array.deduplicateSorted` as we haven't completely sorted,
  -- and in fact want to keep some of the residual ordering from the discrimination tree.
  let mut forward : NameSet := ∅
  let mut backward : NameSet := ∅
  let mut deduped := #[]
  for (l, s, w) in candidates do
    if forbidden.contains l then continue
    if s then
      if ¬ backward.contains l then
        deduped := deduped.push (l, s, w)
        backward := backward.insert l
    else
      if ¬ forward.contains l then
        deduped := deduped.push (l, s, w)
        forward := forward.insert l

  trace[Tactic.rewrites.lemmas] m!"Candidate rewrite lemmas:\n{deduped}"

  let hyps := hyps.map fun ⟨hyp, symm, weight⟩ => (Sum.inl hyp, symm, weight)
  let lemmas := deduped.map fun ⟨lem, symm, weight⟩ => (Sum.inr lem, symm, weight)
  pure <| hyps ++ lemmas

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Rewrites/Variantf3f339d11fa4683107839409e4108eef6c6ba84660079cfdf92293fa3e74e368.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Rewrites/Variantf3f339d11fa4683107839409e4108eef6c6ba84660079cfdf92293fa3e74e368.lean#L249).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `334ea0e5df7b1ae48597b1fff1fa79ae55a3b575` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
