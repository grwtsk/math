## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c7cbb2a2-92a1-a80b-a1d1-67eba9495312`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 922–933.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma reflTransGen_symmGen : ReflTransGen (SymmGen r) = EqvGen r := by
  rw [← eqvGen_eq_reflTransGen, eqvGen_symmGen]

end EqvGen

/-- The join of a relation on a single type is a new relation for which
pairs of terms are related if there is a third term they are both
related to.  For example, if `r` is a relation representing rewrites
in a term rewriting system, then *confluence* is the property that if
`a` rewrites to both `b` and `c`, then `join r` relates `b` and `c`
(see `Relation.church_rosser`).

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Relation/Variant4fec7f4e29d1d7e173c46390261ccb689c96c7508294985af69d67b3611d9adf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Relation/Variant4fec7f4e29d1d7e173c46390261ccb689c96c7508294985af69d67b3611d9adf.lean#L922).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d0922cc4358685f7574fcf0005edd2ea61f7fdad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
