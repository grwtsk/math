## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f3dbfca6-816f-943e-c6bd-ce81d19f3531`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 933–954.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem church_rosser (h : ∀ a b c, r a b → r a c → ∃ d, ReflGen r b d ∧ ReflTransGen r c d)
    (hab : ReflTransGen r a b) (hac : ReflTransGen r a c) : Join (ReflTransGen r) b c := by
  induction hab with
  | refl => exact ⟨c, hac, refl⟩
  | @tail d e _ hde ih =>
    rcases ih with ⟨b, hdb, hcb⟩
    have : ∃ a, ReflTransGen r e a ∧ ReflGen r b a := by
      clear hcb
      induction hdb with
      | refl => exact ⟨e, refl, ReflGen.single hde⟩
      | @tail f b _ hfb ih =>
        rcases ih with ⟨a, hea, hfa⟩
        cases hfa with
        | refl => exact ⟨b, hea.tail hfb, ReflGen.refl⟩
        | single hfa =>
          rcases h _ _ _ hfb hfa with ⟨c, hbc, hac⟩
          exact ⟨c, hea.trans hac, hbc⟩
    rcases this with ⟨a, hea, hba⟩
    cases hba with
    | refl => exact ⟨b, hea, hcb⟩
    | single hba => exact ⟨a, hea, hcb.tail hba⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Relation/Variantd8598513756354380671e64f8b2927fbf82a27b1e244c16ec873c94cf08a5e0c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Relation/Variantd8598513756354380671e64f8b2927fbf82a27b1e244c16ec873c94cf08a5e0c.lean#L933).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `de16670cbf66088cd1d5c9fb03f5b7f4b2bf6133` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
