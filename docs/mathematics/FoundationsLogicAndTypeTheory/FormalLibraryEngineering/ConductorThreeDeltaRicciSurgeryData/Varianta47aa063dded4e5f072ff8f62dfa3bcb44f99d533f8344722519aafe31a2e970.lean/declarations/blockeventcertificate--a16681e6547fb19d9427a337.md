## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b803b34b89172fe2bac2ebe89e21fb567db4a3c042c43933e95e096a9c6ddaf7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 459–476.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure BlockEventCertificate {N : ℕ}
    {scale : TypeIIScaleSurgeryData N}
    (parent : TypeIIBilinearSurgeryState scale) where
  surgery : TypeIIBlockSurgery N parent.cutoffMatrix scale.spatialCarrier
  spatialAssignment : BlockAssignmentsRealizeNeckSides surgery
  childState : surgery.Child → TypeIIBilinearSurgeryState scale
  child_cutoff : ∀ child,
    (childState child).cutoffMatrix = surgery.blockMatrix child
  child_leftCoefficient : ∀ child left,
    (childState child).leftCoefficient left =
      if surgery.leftBlock left = child then parent.leftCoefficient left else 0
  child_rightCoefficient : ∀ child right,
    (childState child).rightCoefficient right =
      if surgery.rightBlock right = child then parent.rightCoefficient right else 0

/-- Masking by a child block does not change the pairing of that block
matrix, because the block matrix has no support outside the child. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ConductorThreeDeltaRicciSurgeryData/Varianta47aa063dded4e5f072ff8f62dfa3bcb44f99d533f8344722519aafe31a2e970.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ConductorThreeDeltaRicciSurgeryData/Varianta47aa063dded4e5f072ff8f62dfa3bcb44f99d533f8344722519aafe31a2e970.lean#L459).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8b4ca35e24d86473513aa5bf8296282db57cbc65` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
