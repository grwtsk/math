## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e3b73845a9097534accfe0333a8b6bf1f5e15a06b67f465d4597bfc51aec5309`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 804–819.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def BalancedCutMassBudget
    (data : ConductorThreeDeltaRicciSurgeryData) : Prop :=
  ∃ contraction : ℝ, 0 ≤ contraction ∧ contraction < 1 ∧
    ∀ (N : ℕ) (hN : 2 ≤ N)
      (parent : TypeIIBilinearSurgeryState (data.scaleData N hN))
      (certificate : BlockEventCertificate parent),
      data.nextEvent N hN parent = TypeIIEvent.surgery certificate →
        (∑ child, (certificate.childState child).interactionMass) ≤
            parent.interactionMass ∧
          ∀ child, (certificate.childState child).interactionMass ≤
            contraction * parent.interactionMass

/-- A quantitative **whole-tree** event-count theorem is stronger than both
mere termination and a branch-depth bound.  It remains a separate
obligation, because a block event may have many children. -/
@[expose]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ConductorThreeDeltaRicciSurgeryData/Variant037f4af48e388cafb91105086c07f03dbd081b66c6385a31167ee68b776376c7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ConductorThreeDeltaRicciSurgeryData/Variant037f4af48e388cafb91105086c07f03dbd081b66c6385a31167ee68b776376c7.lean#L804).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `760c4dd3808b1969696f47c87875be6fe9e0125a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
