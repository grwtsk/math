## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:077e94f984d5da7647ff1691060d13cf8c9ff5e1280e8eed6ad5db33a57513bf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 876–894.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def GlobalFlowDefectBudget
    (data : ConductorThreeDeltaRicciSurgeryData) : Prop :=
  ∀ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε → ∃ C : ℝ, 0 ≤ C ∧
    ∀ (N : ℕ) (hN : 2 ≤ N)
      (parent : TypeIIBilinearSurgeryState (data.scaleData N hN))
      (certificate : StateFlowCertificate parent),
      data.nextEvent N hN parent = TypeIIEvent.flow certificate →
      ∃ localBudget : ℝ,
        FullSignedDefectBudget certificate.flow localBudget ∧
        localBudget * certificate.flow.finalTime ≤
          C * (N : ℝ) ^ (1 / 2 + ε)

/-- A local pointwise cross-neck estimate for one chosen block event.

This remains useful as a diagnostic lemma target, but it is not sufficient
for final assembly: summing it over a branching tree may lose control.  The
canonical program below therefore requires `SurgeryTreeCrossCarlesonEstimate`
instead. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ConductorThreeDeltaRicciSurgeryData/Variantad0423a330de707e474d2ddfefe8e599bd54dabb97b7ed149e36951a0b7dfbff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ConductorThreeDeltaRicciSurgeryData/Variantad0423a330de707e474d2ddfefe8e599bd54dabb97b7ed149e36951a0b7dfbff.lean#L876).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `39dd5058274da910d9780ab0b559fec54a74f6e3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
