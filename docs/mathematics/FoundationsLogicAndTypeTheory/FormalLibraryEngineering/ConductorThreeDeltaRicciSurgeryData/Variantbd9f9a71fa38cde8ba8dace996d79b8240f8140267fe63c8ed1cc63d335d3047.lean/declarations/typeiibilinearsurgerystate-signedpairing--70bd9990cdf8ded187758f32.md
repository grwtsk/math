## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:63e01153be95c58f54f25905c6ea87b5ff1125185353204143b2664a97ac8d26`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 183–192.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def TypeIIBilinearSurgeryState.signedPairing {N : ℕ}
    {scale : TypeIIScaleSurgeryData N}
    (state : TypeIIBilinearSurgeryState scale) (x : ℕ) : ℂ :=
  -inner ℂ state.leftVector (state.incidence x state.rightVector) -
    typeIIMatrixPairing state.leftCoefficient (state.residualMatrix x)
      state.rightCoefficient

/-- Matrix of the state's current packet incidence in the coordinate bases
used by its exact factorization. -/
@[expose]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ConductorThreeDeltaRicciSurgeryData/Variantbd9f9a71fa38cde8ba8dace996d79b8240f8140267fe63c8ed1cc63d335d3047.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ConductorThreeDeltaRicciSurgeryData/Variantbd9f9a71fa38cde8ba8dace996d79b8240f8140267fe63c8ed1cc63d335d3047.lean#L183).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `44b1cc08cb6231dcca388a44a5116d8627793176` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
