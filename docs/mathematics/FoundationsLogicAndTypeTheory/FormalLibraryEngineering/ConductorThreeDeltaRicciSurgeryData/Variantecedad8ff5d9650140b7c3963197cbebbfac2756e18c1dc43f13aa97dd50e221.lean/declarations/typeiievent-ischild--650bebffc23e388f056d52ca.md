## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:30914dc8d75a5d26c489698c53a94e90dce7c95998afa31e0c0dfe068166ca72`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 602–613.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def TypeIIEvent.IsChild {N : ℕ} {scale : TypeIIScaleSurgeryData N}
    {parent : TypeIIBilinearSurgeryState scale}
    (event : TypeIIEvent parent)
    (child : TypeIIBilinearSurgeryState scale) : Prop :=
  match event with
  | .terminal _ => False
  | .flow certificate => child = certificate.child
  | .surgery certificate => ∃ index, child = certificate.childState index

/-- Structural conductor-three surgery data.  It contains constructions and
exact invariants only; no terminal, defect, cross-neck, total-cost, or Type II
maximal estimate occurs in this structure. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ConductorThreeDeltaRicciSurgeryData/Variantecedad8ff5d9650140b7c3963197cbebbfac2756e18c1dc43f13aa97dd50e221.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ConductorThreeDeltaRicciSurgeryData/Variantecedad8ff5d9650140b7c3963197cbebbfac2756e18c1dc43f13aa97dd50e221.lean#L602).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5d40b5f56f814f9f0b8f0a6f40c8f0a1ef6745b0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
