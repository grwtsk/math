## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d7a93b0bcfab76128dbe2f9b1d4b291f1a843454fbf22e0ce0b487fcb5c18ae0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 161–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
  private def matchAtomic (id : Name) (declName : Name) (danglingDot : Bool) : Bool :=
    if danglingDot then
      false
    else
      match id, declName with
      | .str .anonymous s₁, .str .anonymous s₂ => s₁.charactersIn s₂
      | _, _ => false

  /--
  Truncate the given identifier and make sure it has length `≤ newLength`.
  This function assumes `id` does not contain `Name.num` constructors.
  -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CompletionCollectors/Variant98c007f4366e8c24f50adc1ad11049c7f2be5aaf91ef949c8ef2c35765fd6126.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CompletionCollectors/Variant98c007f4366e8c24f50adc1ad11049c7f2be5aaf91ef949c8ef2c35765fd6126.lean#L161).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f876fe775b7afc6a446227b3c3060b6ba3eafb2e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
