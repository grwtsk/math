## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6fe621930f21d758d7ffc7e09729359282618f3fd845205443a3b22fc9faa228`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 602–619.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def tacticCompletion
    (uri               : DocumentUri)
    (pos               : Lsp.Position)
    (completionInfoPos : Nat)
    (ctx               : ContextInfo)
    : IO (Array ResolvableCompletionItem) := ctx.runMetaM .empty do
  -- Don't include tactics that are identified only by their internal parser name
  let allTacticDocs ← Tactic.Doc.allTacticDocs (includeUnnamed := false)
  let items : Array ResolvableCompletionItem := allTacticDocs.map fun tacticDoc => {
      label          := tacticDoc.userName
      detail?        := none
      documentation? := tacticDoc.docString.map fun docString =>
        { value := docString, kind := MarkupKind.markdown : MarkupContent }
      kind?          := CompletionItemKind.keyword
      data?          := { uri, pos, cPos? := completionInfoPos, id? := none : ResolvableCompletionItemData }
    }
  return items

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CompletionCollectors/Variant991ae33b429a6990f5b628e13d3ed64a2a9e7b5b4cbf23429f6b7d40fa5a81b6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CompletionCollectors/Variant991ae33b429a6990f5b628e13d3ed64a2a9e7b5b4cbf23429f6b7d40fa5a81b6.lean#L602).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c8b14d07502b84f46376d191f0cd0845ca5a31cf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
