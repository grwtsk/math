## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:df8aae2d988dd37c9258b2bcc61df8515f1b7e80797c2bc05ac6b68aefcc5c98`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 38–46.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def TwistedPsiHalfPlusEpsilon : Prop :=
  ∀ epsilon : ℝ, 0 < epsilon →
    ∃ C : ℝ, 0 ≤ C ∧
      ∀ x : ℕ, 2 ≤ x →
        |conductorThreePsi x| ≤
          C * (x : ℝ) ^ (1 / 2 + epsilon)

/-- Finite mass used to absorb the initial segment omitted by an eventual
critical estimate. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ConductorThreeHalfPlusEpsilon/Variante631c61e5db0d525e80879c76637191164c85da31bf92532605951bf6d59d1af.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ConductorThreeHalfPlusEpsilon/Variante631c61e5db0d525e80879c76637191164c85da31bf92532605951bf6d59d1af.lean#L38).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1467b976b9f95f44a7bd4467bb4d758fb57fc567` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
