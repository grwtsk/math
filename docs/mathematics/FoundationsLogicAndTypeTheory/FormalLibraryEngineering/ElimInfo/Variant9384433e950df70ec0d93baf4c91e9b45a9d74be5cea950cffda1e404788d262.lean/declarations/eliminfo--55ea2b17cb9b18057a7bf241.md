## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cce38e28956b1f265bbea24b49ff53993710aff82e1bbedfbe24d51bcb4faafa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 43–58.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ElimInfo where
  elimExpr   : Expr
  elimType   : Expr
  motivePos  : Nat
  targetsPos : Array Nat := #[]
  altsInfo   : Array ElimAltInfo := #[]
  /--
  Extra arguments to the motive, after the targets, that are instantiated with
  non-atomic expressions in the goal
  -/
  numComplexMotiveArgs : Nat
  deriving Repr, Inhabited


/-- Given the type `t` of an alternative, determines the number of parameters
(.forall and .let)-bound, and whether the conclusion is a `motive`-application.  -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ElimInfo/Variant9384433e950df70ec0d93baf4c91e9b45a9d74be5cea950cffda1e404788d262.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ElimInfo/Variant9384433e950df70ec0d93baf4c91e9b45a9d74be5cea950cffda1e404788d262.lean#L43).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6d04bc364fef41a70cb3841fe77e5401bd70cb32` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
