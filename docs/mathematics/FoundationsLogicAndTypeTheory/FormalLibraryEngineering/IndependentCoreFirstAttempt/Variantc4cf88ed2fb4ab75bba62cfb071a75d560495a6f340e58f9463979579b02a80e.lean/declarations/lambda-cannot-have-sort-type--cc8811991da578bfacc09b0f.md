## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:817922c0-a5c0-6609-f4c1-5966975fb951`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1575–1581.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lambda_cannot_have_sort_type {A b : Expr S} {s : S}
    (h : HasType P Γ (.lam A b) (.sort s)) : False := by
  obtain ⟨B, t, hb, hPi, hc⟩ := h.generation_lam
  exact Converts.pi_not_sort (.symm _ _ hc)

/-- No functionality is needed for neutral uniqueness: the declaration fixes
its head type, and product compatibility fixes every successive codomain. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/IndependentCoreFirstAttempt/Variantc4cf88ed2fb4ab75bba62cfb071a75d560495a6f340e58f9463979579b02a80e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/IndependentCoreFirstAttempt/Variantc4cf88ed2fb4ab75bba62cfb071a75d560495a6f340e58f9463979579b02a80e.lean#L1575).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `24b79a45594b1d7c2785a2efbf2897e6c32d55b8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
