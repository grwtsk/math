## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5a4592c73fdd7cbc9ed677bc1584735582c203e8f7748ac8b146f601c94acaec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 838–850.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure DivModState (w : Nat) : Type where
  /-- The number of bits in the numerator that are not yet processed -/
  wn : Nat
  /-- The number of bits in the remainder (and quotient) -/
  wr : Nat
  /-- The current quotient. -/
  q : BitVec w
  /-- The current remainder. -/
  r : BitVec w


/-- `DivModArgs` contains the arguments to a `divrem` call which remain constant throughout
execution. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Bitblast/Variantb9fa500e368b8bd13bf989d8770b5a6329ea6245d7803e3e14a7c114e06667c1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Bitblast/Variantb9fa500e368b8bd13bf989d8770b5a6329ea6245d7803e3e14a7c114e06667c1.lean#L838).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77050a46ff99d345da672844caf68022db57852a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
