## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d995d76716ccbd52e76816b9e0d6988a9fce9003386b199b6e98fa79a6767efa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 502–530.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
def withHeadRefIfTagAppFns (d : Delab) : Delab := do
  let tagAppFns ← getPPOption getPPTagAppFns
  if tagAppFns && (← getExpr).getAppFn.consumeMData.isConst then
    -- Delaborate the head to register term info and get a syntax we can use for the ref.
    -- The syntax `f` itself is thrown away.
    let f ← withNaryFn <| withOptionAtCurrPos `pp.tagAppFns true delab
    let stx ← withRef f d
    -- Annotate to ensure that the full syntax still refers to the whole expression.
    annotateTermInfo stx
  else
    d

/--
`notation3` declares notation using Lean-3-style syntax.

Examples:
```
notation3 "∀ᶠ " (...) " in " f ", " r:(scoped p => Filter.eventually p f) => r
notation3 "MyList[" (x", "* => foldr (a b => MyList.cons a b) MyList.nil) "]" => x
```
By default notation is unable to mention any variables defined using `variable`, but
`local notation3` is able to use such local variables.

Use `notation3 (prettyPrint := false)` to keep the command from generating a pretty printer
for the notation.

This command can be used in mathlib4 but it has an uncertain future and was created primarily
for backward compatibility.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Notation3/Variante5dc1c82dbde4155dd425e5f06eb8dfed77f58aa61b86cadad618eef25c5c426.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Notation3/Variante5dc1c82dbde4155dd425e5f06eb8dfed77f58aa61b86cadad618eef25c5c426.lean#L502).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3d15d52cfba8de9c4ea41db34c6bf6b8df224524` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
