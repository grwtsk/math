## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e078fea8dc5071f3677366743a649109e4006206bba1091b4139263e2c2b23f7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 119–139.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def collectFreshMVars [Monad m] [MonadLiftT MetaM m] (k : m Expr) : m (Expr × Array MVarId) := do
  let mvarCounterSaved := (← liftMetaM getMCtx).mvarCounter
  let val ← k
  let newMVarIds ← getMVarsNoDelayed val
  /- Filter out all mvars that were created prior to `k`. -/
  let newMVarIds ← filterOldMVars newMVarIds mvarCounterSaved
  /-
  We sort the new metavariable ids by index to ensure the new goals are ordered using the order the metavariables have been created.
  See issue #1682.
  Potential problem: if elaboration of subterms is delayed the order the new metavariables are created may not match the order they
  appear in the `.lean` file. We should tell users to prefer tagged goals.
  -/
  let newMVarIds ← liftMetaM <| sortMVarIdsByIndex newMVarIds
  return (val, newMVarIds)

/--
Execute `k`, and collect new "holes" in the resulting expression.

* `parentTag` and `tagSuffix` are used to tag untagged goals with `Lean.Elab.Tactic.tagUntaggedGoals`.
* If `allowNaturalHoles` is true, then `_`'s are allowed and create new goals.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ElabTerm/Variantd3a5a457009b8372dab3d6e071a4a23d52a05a7321704a9f3af179ea030ec5eb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ElabTerm/Variantd3a5a457009b8372dab3d6e071a4a23d52a05a7321704a9f3af179ea030ec5eb.lean#L119).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f956c86be3f826312d1289018b6f880ec2195509` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
