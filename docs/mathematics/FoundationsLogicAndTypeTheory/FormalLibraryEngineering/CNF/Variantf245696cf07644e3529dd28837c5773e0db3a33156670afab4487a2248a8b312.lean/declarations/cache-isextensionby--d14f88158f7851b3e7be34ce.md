## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9db71484bf052596ff8354011505b5ff740b5b89038e00f8224f518403f5b30e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 198–211.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Cache.IsExtensionBy (cache1 : Cache aig cnf1) (cache2 : Cache aig cnf2) (new : Nat)
    (hnew : new < aig.decls.size) : Prop where
  /--
  No entry is invalidated.
  -/
  extension : ∀ (idx : Nat) (hidx : idx < aig.decls.size),
                cache1.marks[idx]'(by have := cache1.hmarks; omega) = true
                  →
                cache2.marks[idx]'(by have := cache2.hmarks; omega) = true
  /--
  The second cache is true at the new index.
  -/
  trueAt : cache2.marks[new]'(by have := cache2.hmarks; omega) = true

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CNF/Variantf245696cf07644e3529dd28837c5773e0db3a33156670afab4487a2248a8b312.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CNF/Variantf245696cf07644e3529dd28837c5773e0db3a33156670afab4487a2248a8b312.lean#L198).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b0184a078c2239ae7e1588b9d627c3fe939fbc5e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
