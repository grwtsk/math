## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4c239fb5fc4c0685abe88e25673f4e89049218865b848fcc565af4e370c83ad4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 161–184.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def solverChoiceStructuralQuine
    (Q : PhaseIIResidualQuotient G) :
    StructuralQuine.{max u v, v, 0, 0, c} (phaseIIResidualCertificateFamily G) where
  quotient := Q.solverChoiceRepresentation
  reconstruct := fun _ => Q.representative
  «section» := by
    intro q
    cases q
    rfl
  reconstruct_equivalent := by
    intro S
    exact phaseIIResidualCertificate_equivalent Q.representative S
  minimal := solverChoiceRepresentation_minimal.{u, v, c} Q

end PhaseIIResidualQuotient

residual quotient. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PhaseIIResidualQuotient/Variantc2343771dc55a9f42acf493fa50c7788144492384557958e92e6c9d2c6e9cece.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PhaseIIResidualQuotient/Variantc2343771dc55a9f42acf493fa50c7788144492384557958e92e6c9d2c6e9cece.lean#L161).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6e9cdda7a65069676d16fb773622b937a167d6dc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
