## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6361498dc9e92b60606a496be4fa67b958a3b7a3516c9f81192da6686b61d714`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 83–100.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
abbrev PostShape.args : PostShape.{u} → List (Type u)
  | .pure => []
  | .arg σ s => σ :: PostShape.args s
  | .except _ s => PostShape.args s

/--
An assertion about the state fields for a monad whose postcondition shape is `ps`.

Concretely, this is an abbreviation for `SPred` applied to the `.arg`s in the given predicate shape, so all theorems about `SPred` apply.

Examples:
```lean example
example : Assertion (.arg ρ .pure) = (ρ → ULift Prop) := rfl
example : Assertion (.except ε .pure) = ULift Prop := rfl
example : Assertion (.arg σ (.except ε .pure)) = (σ → ULift Prop) := rfl
example : Assertion (.except ε (.arg σ .pure)) = (σ → ULift Prop) := rfl
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PostCond/Variant59caa4c8cee243356fb4cec0aa63bd6f1e5ac18e250db27244a191214a928605.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PostCond/Variant59caa4c8cee243356fb4cec0aa63bd6f1e5ac18e250db27244a191214a928605.lean#L83).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f64f9c0b07722e346fce05f277ea13625593d257` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
