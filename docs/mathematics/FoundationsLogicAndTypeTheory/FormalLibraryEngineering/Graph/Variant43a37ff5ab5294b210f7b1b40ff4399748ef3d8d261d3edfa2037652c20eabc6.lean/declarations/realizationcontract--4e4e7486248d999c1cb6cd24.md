## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ba80b507d84633d835c4f45152376759b87bd0ab7b0fa8a2e22f6ddbfc1eb551`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 85–98.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure RealizationContract
    {Coordinate : Type uCoordinate} {Edge : Type uEdge}
    {specification : SieveSpecification Coordinate}
    {procedure : SieveProcedure specification}
    (soundness : SieveSoundness procedure)
    (materializedGraph : CoordinateGraph .Materialized Coordinate Edge) where
  version : ArtifactRef .realizationRule
  realizeMaterialized :
    ∀ {source target}
      (evaluation : SieveEvaluation procedure source target),
      SieveWitness soundness evaluation →
        EdgeOccurrence materializedGraph source target

/-- Activity record joining one exact sieve witness to one occurrence. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Graph/Variant43a37ff5ab5294b210f7b1b40ff4399748ef3d8d261d3edfa2037652c20eabc6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Graph/Variant43a37ff5ab5294b210f7b1b40ff4399748ef3d8d261d3edfa2037652c20eabc6.lean#L85).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5e94f8464599f2151bd56f3d70135c7465717dad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
