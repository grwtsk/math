## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:94aed36f-953c-468a-d9ae-73c505f0d9e7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 151–158.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Zip.rel₁_of_right [Finite α₁ m] [Productive α₂ m]
    {left : IterM (α := α₁) m β₁} {b b' : _} {it' it : IterM (α := α₂) m β₂}
    (h : b' = b)
    (h' : it'.finitelyManySkips.Rel it.finitelyManySkips) :
    Zip.Rel₁ m ⟨left, b', it'⟩ ⟨left, b, it⟩ := by
  cases h
  exact Prod.Lex.right _ <| Prod.Lex.right _ h'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Zip/Variante7f058d84fb58ac85e3121e89c93d16a48141bae381e3b95272bca539b9cea64.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Zip/Variante7f058d84fb58ac85e3121e89c93d16a48141bae381e3b95272bca539b9cea64.lean#L151).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `59f0ae0391f6cec515d9977763df438b8fd17098` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
