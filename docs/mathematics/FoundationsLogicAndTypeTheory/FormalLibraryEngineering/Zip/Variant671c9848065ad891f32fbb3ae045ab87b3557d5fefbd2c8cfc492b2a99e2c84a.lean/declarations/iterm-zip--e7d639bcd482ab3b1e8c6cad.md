## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3347142328fa817d19d5c2c3050d6afc18d9d13c80fe3a2d91ffdf4d46a86b6d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 70–80.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IterM.zip (left : IterM (α := α₁) m β₁) (right : IterM (α := α₂) m β₂) :
    IterM (α := Types.Zip α₁ m α₂ β₂) m (β₁ × β₂) :=
  ⟨⟨left, none, right⟩⟩

namespace Iterators.Types

/--
`it.PlausibleStep step` is the proposition that `step` is a possible next step from the
`zip` iterator `it`. This is mostly internally relevant, except if one needs to manually
prove termination (`Finite` or `Productive` instances, for example) of a `zip` iterator.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Zip/Variant671c9848065ad891f32fbb3ae045ab87b3557d5fefbd2c8cfc492b2a99e2c84a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Zip/Variant671c9848065ad891f32fbb3ae045ab87b3557d5fefbd2c8cfc492b2a99e2c84a.lean#L70).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c24e9496ada9f89563ff415b85b94deea88be8e2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
