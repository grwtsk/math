## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `syntax` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2c81c10a5d5bc407dfbab4a96b09d19acca6d572b1dfb18ae63980ed22f5fb9c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 20–24.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
syntax renameArg := term " => " ident

/-- `rename' h => hnew` renames the hypothesis named `h` to `hnew`.
To rename several hypothesis, use `rename' h₁ => h₁new, h₂ => h₂new`.
You can use `rename' a => b, b => a` to swap two variables. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Rename/Variant8446c46a9aab1626946cab3dc19c18d085a2f8111c99e1b16c0a59315edcd3ae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Rename/Variant8446c46a9aab1626946cab3dc19c18d085a2f8111c99e1b16c0a59315edcd3ae.lean#L20).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5d56eda7db2d6af7471f60167be74340e18286d4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
