## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `initialize` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cb91919b05455e9df8a2eb3b68e9e9eda9c3fb9ba98bf560dd381f3d37eae3a2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 549–563.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
initialize Lean.registerBuiltinAttribute {
  name := `dlmfTag
  descr := "Apply a DLMF identifier to a declaration."
  add := fun decl stx _attrKind => do
    let (id, comment) ← match stx with
      | `(attr| dlmf $id $[$comment]?) => pure (id, comment)
      | _ => throwUnsupportedSyntax
    addCrossRefDoc .dlmf decl (← id.getDlmfId) ((comment.map (·.getString)).getD "")
  -- docstrings are immutable once an asynchronous elaboration task has been started
  applicationTime := .beforeElaboration
}

end Mathlib.CrossRef

/-- Returns the array of `Tag`s in the environment, sorted alphabetically by tag. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CrossRefAttribute/Variant5a40a0b59dff8f54cb08563fa1feb1c78c9ce7df4ef6e776d6d58e3fb432d2c3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CrossRefAttribute/Variant5a40a0b59dff8f54cb08563fa1feb1c78c9ce7df4ef6e776d6d58e3fb432d2c3.lean#L549).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d0d3824e33ba434ed33cc7d6f7e5ff91baa799f4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
