## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1cbe2ccf8c8fde684e190c453d8f3d444ac0a24ae8ced2bd8c47513bbc6f868b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 37–48.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Theorem.declName (thm : Theorem) : Option Name := thm.expr.getAppFn.constName?

end Lean.Meta.Sym.Simp

namespace Lean.Meta.Tactic.Cbv
open Lean.Meta.Sym.Simp

/--
  Entry of the `CbvEvalExtension`.
  Consists of name of the theorem used, the precomputed `Theorem` object 
  and a name of the head function appearing on the left-hand side of the theorem.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CbvEvalExt/Variantdfe9dfbbe9f7fd877921b37153a881ebd757d081cc0ff6144ad48b7391075004.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CbvEvalExt/Variantdfe9dfbbe9f7fd877921b37153a881ebd757d081cc0ff6144ad48b7391075004.lean#L37).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8eab48d4d296b61fbd0a654fa039acf08ad5e9e9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
