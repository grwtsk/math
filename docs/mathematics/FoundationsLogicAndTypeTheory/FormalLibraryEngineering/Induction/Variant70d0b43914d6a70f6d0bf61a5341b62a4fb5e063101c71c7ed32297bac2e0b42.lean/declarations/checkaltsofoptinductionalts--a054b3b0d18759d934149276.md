## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8f9c0a904631908f978fb7dd97f5f3ef139791df4d8df3bd941bc56c37b7306d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 760–770.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def checkAltsOfOptInductionAlts (optInductionAlts : Syntax) : TacticM Unit :=
  unless optInductionAlts.isNone do
    let mut found := false
    for alt in getAltsOfInductionAlts optInductionAlts[0] do
      if isAltWildcard alt then
        unless (getAltVars alt).isEmpty do
          throwErrorAt alt "The wildcard alternative `| _ => ...` must not specify variable names"
        if found then
          throwErrorAt alt "More than one wildcard alternative `| _ => ...` used"
        found := true

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Induction/Variant70d0b43914d6a70f6d0bf61a5341b62a4fb5e063101c71c7ed32297bac2e0b42.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Induction/Variant70d0b43914d6a70f6d0bf61a5341b62a4fb5e063101c71c7ed32297bac2e0b42.lean#L760).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `96201dae32b53e8b351c7f6a2177e432e71a990e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
