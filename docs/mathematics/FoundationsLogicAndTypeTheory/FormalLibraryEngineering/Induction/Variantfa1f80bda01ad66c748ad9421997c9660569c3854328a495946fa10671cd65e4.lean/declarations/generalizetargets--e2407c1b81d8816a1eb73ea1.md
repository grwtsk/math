## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9851d266eb6b60808ec228674d61f984c428ef74de2ad76541d462040d01778b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 943–962.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def generalizeTargets (exprs : Array Expr) : TacticM (Array Expr) := do
  withMainContext do
    let exprToGeneralize ← exprs.filterM (shouldGeneralizeTarget ·)
    if exprToGeneralize.isEmpty then
      return exprs
    liftMetaTacticAux fun mvarId => do
      let (fvarIdsNew, mvarId) ← mvarId.generalize (exprToGeneralize.map ({ expr := · }))
      assert! fvarIdsNew.size == exprToGeneralize.size
      let mut result := #[]
      let mut j := 0
      for expr in exprs do
        if (← shouldGeneralizeTarget expr) then
          result := result.push (mkFVar fvarIdsNew[j]!)
          j := j+1
        else
          result := result.push expr
      return (result, [mvarId])

-- This is public for now as it is used in Mathlib's `induction'` tactic,
-- which is no longer used in Mathlib, but still prevalent in downstream projects.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Induction/Variantfa1f80bda01ad66c748ad9421997c9660569c3854328a495946fa10671cd65e4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Induction/Variantfa1f80bda01ad66c748ad9421997c9660569c3854328a495946fa10671cd65e4.lean#L943).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e1ac382d587c03dd137dad0d3b17273cb7572b72` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
