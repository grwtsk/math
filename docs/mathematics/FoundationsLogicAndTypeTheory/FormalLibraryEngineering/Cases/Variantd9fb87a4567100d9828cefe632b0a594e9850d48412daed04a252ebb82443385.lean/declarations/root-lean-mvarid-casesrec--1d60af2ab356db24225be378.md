## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3201dcae63dcfe071b187c391f25f4a8e64dd00df6989cd17ad5bc0620a35a6b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 321–335.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def _root_.Lean.MVarId.casesRec (mvarId : MVarId) (p : LocalDecl → MetaM Bool) : MetaM (List MVarId) :=
  saturate mvarId fun mvarId =>
    mvarId.withContext do
      for localDecl in (← getLCtx) do
        if (← p localDecl) then
          let r? ← observing? do
            let r ← mvarId.cases localDecl.fvarId
            return r.toList.map (·.mvarId)
          if r?.isSome then
            return r?
      return none

/--
Applies `cases` (recursively) to any hypothesis of the form `h : p ∧ q`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Cases/Variantd9fb87a4567100d9828cefe632b0a594e9850d48412daed04a252ebb82443385.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Cases/Variantd9fb87a4567100d9828cefe632b0a594e9850d48412daed04a252ebb82443385.lean#L321).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `28a0c4b825a83c9f24683c035aabcb13c8cc2651` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
