## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d85f2203756afe16a3fc9d1b465e1b96789914f40450b0816c1220c75cd15c13`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 376–379.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def addSubgoalsAction : TacticCodeAction := fun params _ _ stk node => do
  let (_ :: (seq, i) :: stk@(_ :: t :: _), .node (.ofTacticInfo info) _) := (stk, node) | return #[]
  unless t.1.getKind == ``Parser.Tactic.tacticSeq do return #[]
  addSubgoalsActionCore params (i/2) ((seq, 0) :: stk) info.goalsBefore
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Misc/Variant07f8bb37f7a7327d3c3b2dcd16a59810c2df7bd400927484c3dd3573b87ba439.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Misc/Variant07f8bb37f7a7327d3c3b2dcd16a59810c2df7bd400927484c3dd3573b87ba439.lean#L376).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2b480dd006405f80640df5ba74b92bf07fb2758a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
