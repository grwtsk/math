## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9387f46c0f295161d4205e286b44d3b6ba45b8ce2d516d947dc236bf0e6f3c0b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 872–883.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def isDefEqAppDefault (t : Expr) (s : Expr) : DefEqM Bool := do
  let .app f₁ a₁ := t | if s.isApp then return false else isDefEqMain t s
  let .app f₂ a₂ := s | return false
  unless (← isDefEqAppDefault f₁ f₂) do return false
  isDefEqMain a₁ a₂

/--
Attempts to assign an unassigned metavariable on either side.
Tries `t := s` first, then `s := t`. Returns `true` if either assignment succeeds.
Used as a fast path before more expensive unification strategies. Example: using
more expensive `isDefEqI` for instance arguments.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Pattern/Variant516e0d27a48f2beac4bb47b8a1f2a769cae8d26310234e8779da6de8b8598b0f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Pattern/Variant516e0d27a48f2beac4bb47b8a1f2a769cae8d26310234e8779da6de8b8598b0f.lean#L872).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `84d34aaf97dbd8a615cd6aa69750319ace350e45` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
