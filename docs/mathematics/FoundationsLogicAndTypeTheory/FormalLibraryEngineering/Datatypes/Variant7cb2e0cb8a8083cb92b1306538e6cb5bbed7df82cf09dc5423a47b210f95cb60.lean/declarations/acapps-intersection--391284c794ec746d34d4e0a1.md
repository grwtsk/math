## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e57989bbec25bc01021c945f5aef48836d20e6e9e9ef00562206d3a97d796b96`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 232–250.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ACApps.intersection (e₁ e₂ : ACApps) (r : Array Expr := #[]) : Array Expr :=
  match e₁, e₂ with
  | .apps _ args₁, .apps _ args₂ => Id.run do
    let mut r := r
    let mut i₁ := 0
    let mut i₂ := 0
    while h : i₁ < args₁.size ∧ i₂ < args₂.size do
      if args₁[i₁] == args₂[i₂] then
        r := r.push args₁[i₁]
        i₁ := i₁ + 1
        i₂ := i₂ + 1
      else if Expr.lt args₂[i₂] args₁[i₁] then
        i₂ := i₂ + 1
      else
        i₁ := i₁ + 1
    return r
  | _, _ => r

/-- Sorts `args` and applies them to `ACApps.apps`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Datatypes/Variant7cb2e0cb8a8083cb92b1306538e6cb5bbed7df82cf09dc5423a47b210f95cb60.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Datatypes/Variant7cb2e0cb8a8083cb92b1306538e6cb5bbed7df82cf09dc5423a47b210f95cb60.lean#L232).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `11753cacef5885542e5e986f1fd8c60864f6f570` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
