## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1e2989b8a6c41e84614161b37e90571623cf46a298f7ad5700b4e58b4bfb677a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1288–1306.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[builtin_term_elab «match»] def elabMatch : TermElab := fun stx expectedType? => do
  match stx with
  | `(match $discr:term with | $y:ident => $rhs) =>
     if (← isPatternVar y) then expandSimpleMatch stx discr y rhs expectedType? else elabMatchDefault stx expectedType?
  | _ => elabMatchDefault stx expectedType?
where
  elabMatchDefault (stx : Syntax) (expectedType? : Option Expr) : TermElabM Expr := do
    match (← liftMacroM <| expandMatchAlts? stx) with
    | some stxNew => withMacroExpansion stx stxNew <| elabTerm stxNew expectedType?
    | none =>
    match (← expandNonAtomicDiscrs? stx) with
    | some stxNew => withMacroExpansion stx stxNew <| elabTerm stxNew expectedType?
    | none =>
      let discrs         := getDiscrs stx
      let matchOptMotive := getMatchOptMotive stx
      if !matchOptMotive.isNone && discrs.any fun d => !d[0].isNone then
        throwErrorAt matchOptMotive "match motive should not be provided when discriminants with equality proofs are used"
      elabMatchCore stx expectedType?

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Match/Variant960a0ebf9a66c247496fc1fc12083a77e9e0a931646458a78d55f058c133db22.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Match/Variant960a0ebf9a66c247496fc1fc12083a77e9e0a931646458a78d55f058c133db22.lean#L1288).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ab2b4b57363560ab4a981fdcc553128bf077e7d7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
