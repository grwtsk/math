## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f6ebe1f2b8280ed62f27860e59adac2e2c117ac3559b1675eb06a1543a1b2313`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 936–945.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def isFirstVarDoneTransition (p : Problem) : Bool := Id.run do
  if p.alts.isEmpty then
    return false
  let x :: _ := p.vars | unreachable!
  return p.alts.all fun alt => Id.run do
    let p :: _ := alt.patterns | unreachable!
    return match p with
    | .inaccessible e    => e == x
    | _                  => false

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Match/Variant6d447f20c2a7bb9d9bbc26c8cac24f95baed700e13e2fc763a869765dcc44e8e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Match/Variant6d447f20c2a7bb9d9bbc26c8cac24f95baed700e13e2fc763a869765dcc44e8e.lean#L936).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b3f746082ba1cc8331c685092032854f255b087f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
