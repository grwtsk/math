## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bee3840ae697641ed8388cc8f2ccd90db83a8975e7575ff49277658acf762814`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 531–542.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def throwCasesException (p : Problem) (ex : Exception) : MetaM α := do
  match ex with
  | .error ref msg =>
    let exampleMsg :=
      if hasNonTrivialExample p then m!" after processing{indentD <| examplesToMessageData p.examples}" else ""
    throw <| Exception.error ref <| msg.composePreservingKind <| m!"{exampleMsg}\n" ++
              "the dependent pattern matcher can solve the following kinds of equations\n" ++
              "- <var> = <term> and <term> = <var>\n" ++
              "- <term> = <term> where the terms are definitionally equal\n" ++
              "- <constructor> = <constructor>, examples: List.cons x xs = List.cons y ys, and List.cons x xs = List.nil"
  | _ => throw ex

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Match/Variant6d447f20c2a7bb9d9bbc26c8cac24f95baed700e13e2fc763a869765dcc44e8e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Match/Variant6d447f20c2a7bb9d9bbc26c8cac24f95baed700e13e2fc763a869765dcc44e8e.lean#L531).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b3f746082ba1cc8331c685092032854f255b087f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
