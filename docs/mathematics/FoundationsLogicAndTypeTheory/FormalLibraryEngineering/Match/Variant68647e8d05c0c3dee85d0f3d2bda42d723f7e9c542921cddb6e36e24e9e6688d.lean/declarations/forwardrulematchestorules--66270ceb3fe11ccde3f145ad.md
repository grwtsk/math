## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f68c25748355b0e560612ffafd19fee88b33de33da4814c9ddeab2efc61ec265`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 194–217.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def forwardRuleMatchesToRules? (ms : Array ForwardRuleMatch)
    (mkExtra? : ForwardRuleMatch → Option α) :
    Option (Array (Rule α)) := Id.run do
  let mut ruleMap : Std.HashMap RuleName (Array ForwardRuleMatch) := ∅
  for m in ms do
    let name := m.rule.name
    if let some ms := ruleMap[name]? then
      ruleMap := ruleMap.insert name (ms.push m)
    else
      ruleMap := ruleMap.insert name #[m]
  let mut result := Array.mkEmpty ruleMap.size
  for (name, ms) in ruleMap do
    let some extra := mkExtra? ms[0]!
      | return none
    result := result.push {
      indexingMode := .unindexed
      pattern? := none
      tac := .forwardMatches ms
      name, extra
    }
  return some result

/-- Convert forward rule matches to norm rules. Fails if any of the matches is
not a norm rule match.  -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Match/Variant68647e8d05c0c3dee85d0f3d2bda42d723f7e9c542921cddb6e36e24e9e6688d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Match/Variant68647e8d05c0c3dee85d0f3d2bda42d723f7e9c542921cddb6e36e24e9e6688d.lean#L194).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9ba97bdde1a24dcfbaea6c0e8fb1895279ff2e15` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
