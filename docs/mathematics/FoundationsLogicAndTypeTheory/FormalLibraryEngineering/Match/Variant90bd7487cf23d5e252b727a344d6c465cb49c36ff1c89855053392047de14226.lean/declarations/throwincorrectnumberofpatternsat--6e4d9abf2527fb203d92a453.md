## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cd37999cc8a32c2d36b007cc3f17bd827493b43098fab8013e3d0e75a8416f98`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def throwIncorrectNumberOfPatternsAt [ToMessageData α]
    (ref : Syntax) (discrepancyKind : String) (expected actual : Nat) (pats : List α)
    : MetaM Unit := do
  throwErrorAt ref (mkIncorrectNumberOfPatternsMsg discrepancyKind expected actual pats)

/--
Logs an error indicating that the alternative at `ref` contains an unexpected number of patterns.
Remark: we allow `α` to be arbitrary because this error may be thrown before or after elaborating
pattern syntax.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Match/Variant90bd7487cf23d5e252b727a344d6c465cb49c36ff1c89855053392047de14226.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Match/Variant90bd7487cf23d5e252b727a344d6c465cb49c36ff1c89855053392047de14226.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5db035b1778fff6b7854151067e4d3b3754e15d4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
