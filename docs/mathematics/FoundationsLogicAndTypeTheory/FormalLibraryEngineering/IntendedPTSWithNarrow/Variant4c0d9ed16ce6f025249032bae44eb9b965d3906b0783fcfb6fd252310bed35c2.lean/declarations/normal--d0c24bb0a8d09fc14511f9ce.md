## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c4dbed41-83c6-34f3-f2dc-5d3be7cb8a13`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 96–105.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem normal {type : Expr Bool} (typed : BaseArrowType type) : Normal type := by
  induction typed with
  | base => exact Normal.sort false
  | arrow domain codomain ihDomain ihCodomain =>
      intro target reduced
      cases reduced with
      | pi_domain reduced => exact ihDomain _ reduced
      | pi_body reduced => exact ihCodomain _ reduced

/-- Formation of every grammar type in every actual valid source context. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/IntendedPTSWithNarrow/Variant4c0d9ed16ce6f025249032bae44eb9b965d3906b0783fcfb6fd252310bed35c2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/IntendedPTSWithNarrow/Variant4c0d9ed16ce6f025249032bae44eb9b965d3906b0783fcfb6fd252310bed35c2.lean#L96).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `011e21adb9c2f66543beae8fc63f5b5cd63e0793` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
