## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6be99354-2f15-15bd-8523-55041e13f742`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 865–877.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem dvd_gcd_of_dvd (d a x p : Int) (h : d ∣ a * x + p) : gcd d a ∣ p := by
  rcases h with ⟨k, h⟩
  simp [Int.Internal.Linear.gcd]
  replace h := congrArg (· - a*x) h
  simp at h
  rcases @Int.gcd_dvd_left d a with ⟨k₁, h₁⟩
  rcases @Int.gcd_dvd_right d a with ⟨k₂, h₂⟩
  conv at h => enter [2, 1]; rw [h₁]
  conv at h => enter [2, 2]; rw [h₂]
  rw [Int.mul_assoc, Int.mul_assoc, ← Int.mul_sub] at h
  exists k₁ * k - k₂ * x

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Linear/Variant918426e0f1381ba7681e65e2de55f4fe5dd8e46597f1bc2914e822424b9c8006.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Linear/Variant918426e0f1381ba7681e65e2de55f4fe5dd8e46597f1bc2914e822424b9c8006.lean#L865).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1e5d731a50a7d946997aeff81d9c755aabd23e7c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
