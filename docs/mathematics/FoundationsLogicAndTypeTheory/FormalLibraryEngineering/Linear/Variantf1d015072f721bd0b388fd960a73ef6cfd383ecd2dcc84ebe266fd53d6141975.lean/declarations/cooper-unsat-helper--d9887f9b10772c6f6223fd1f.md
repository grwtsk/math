## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:08159708-4363-0c91-0fc2-f81688446ce9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1790–1807.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem cooper_unsat'_helper {a b d c k x : Int}
    (d_pos : d > 0)
    (h₁ : x = k * d + c)
    (h₂ : a ≤ x)
    (h₃ : x ≤ b)
    : ¬ b < (cdiv (a - c) d) * d + c := by
  intro h₄
  have aux₁ : cdiv (a - c) d ≤ k := by
    rw [h₁] at h₂
    replace h₂ := Int.sub_right_le_of_le_add h₂
    exact cdiv_le d_pos h₂
  have aux₂ : cdiv (a - c) d * d ≤ k * d := Int.mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right aux₁ (Int.le_of_lt d_pos)
  have aux₃ : cdiv (a - c) d * d + c ≤ k * d + c := Int.add_le_add_right aux₂ _
  have aux₄ : cdiv (a - c) d * d + c ≤ x := by rw [←h₁] at aux₃; assumption
  have aux₅ : cdiv (a - c) d * d + c ≤ b := Int.le_trans aux₄ h₃
  have := Int.lt_of_le_of_lt aux₅ h₄
  exact Int.lt_irrefl _ this

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Linear/Variantf1d015072f721bd0b388fd960a73ef6cfd383ecd2dcc84ebe266fd53d6141975.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Linear/Variantf1d015072f721bd0b388fd960a73ef6cfd383ecd2dcc84ebe266fd53d6141975.lean#L1790).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c43335f1fbd938bca5e0516fa91279a56144dc3a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
