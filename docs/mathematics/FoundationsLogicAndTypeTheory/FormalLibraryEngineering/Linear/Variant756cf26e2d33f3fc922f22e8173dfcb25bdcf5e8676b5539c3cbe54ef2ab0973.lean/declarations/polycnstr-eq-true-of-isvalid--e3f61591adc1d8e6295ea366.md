## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e2d4107c-9dfe-9a9e-b207-d608a214cbab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 523–531.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem PolyCnstr.eq_true_of_isValid (ctx : Context) {c : PolyCnstr} : c.isValid → c.denote ctx = True := by
  cases c; rename_i eq lhs rhs
  simp [isValid]
  by_cases he : eq = true <;> simp [he, denote, Poly.denote_eq, Poly.denote_le, -and_imp]
  · intro ⟨h₁, h₂⟩
    simp [Poly.of_isZero, h₁, h₂]
  · intro h
    simp [Poly.of_isZero, h]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Linear/Variant756cf26e2d33f3fc922f22e8173dfcb25bdcf5e8676b5539c3cbe54ef2ab0973.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Linear/Variant756cf26e2d33f3fc922f22e8173dfcb25bdcf5e8676b5539c3cbe54ef2ab0973.lean#L523).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ace6b1433d5bcec1e84132c9aace3c3c7302b892` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
