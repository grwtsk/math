## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:087923b2-eabc-48d5-13dd-47bc00584657`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 402–412.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem respBody_family {v : Expr S}
    (hv : HasType P Γ v B.relational.probe.carrier) (mv : WellModed γ v .data)
    : L.Family B.yType (B.respBody L.code KY.code KP.code v) := by
  intro Δ δ e y hy my
  rw [respBody_rename,respBody_instantiate]
  have hv' : HasType P Δ (v.rename e.names) (B.rename e.names).relational.probe.carrier := by
    exact carrier_typed_rename e hv
  have hy' : HasType P Δ y (B.rename e.names).yType := by

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Response/Variant9abb3fc31a9b6271a21d5c87c2a20f0596ec9defa094351ab528aa04723b7462.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Response/Variant9abb3fc31a9b6271a21d5c87c2a20f0596ec9defa094351ab528aa04723b7462.lean#L402).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ca38a90ef5aa26680fc0cb9639d5d19aa2114c73` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
