## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:49b73dda0092621954647c70c81478a7af23100bd9e6650fd189d87fd43c3bd0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 503–511.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def expDepthEstimate (q : ℚ) : Nat :=
  let k := expReduceKMeta q
  let q' : ℚ := q / (2 ^ k : Nat)
  (q'.num.natAbs * 7 / q'.den).max 10

/-- Estimate the Taylor depth needed based on constants inside transcendental functions.
    For `exp(c)`, we account for argument reduction and use roughly `7 * |c/2^k|` terms.
    For `sin(c)`, `cos(c)`, convergence requires roughly `3 * |c|` terms.
    Returns at least 10. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PointIneq/Variantfee6cfe83f4cdfc4b6b771a04f73bbd6010575f4dc5909c5b10d5e3bad34cc0a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/PointIneq/Variantfee6cfe83f4cdfc4b6b771a04f73bbd6010575f4dc5909c5b10d5e3bad34cc0a.lean#L503).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9300903d3adf07184fdb1782d46095a325e1cda1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
