## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:75e884b82f4eda41aa718fd7397b9697c34a4254c132288d00dd4511e32aa9d1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 391–403.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def withNewJpScope (decl : FunDecl .pure) (x : ExtendM α): ExtendM α := do
  withReader (fun ctx => { ctx with currentJp? := some decl.fvarId }) do
    modify fun s => { s with fvarMap := s.fvarMap.insert decl.fvarId {} }
    withNewScope do
      withNewCandidates (decl.params.map (·.fvarId)) do
        x

/--
We call this whenever we visit a new arm of a cases statement.
It will back up the current scope (since we are doing a case split
and want to continue with other arms afterwards) and add all of the
parameters of the match arm to the list of candidates.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/JoinPoints/Variant01c47cca071403dd1eaf967aae1be0f1ec5dce852db59651618d64a2eb0a83da.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/JoinPoints/Variant01c47cca071403dd1eaf967aae1be0f1ec5dce852db59651618d64a2eb0a83da.lean#L391).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4e7b71069eeecf913d3110300cf46d26b1a343b6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
