## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:86c978cd39993f6c1991cb91cc36335239a0df382ced8fb006392a95c08c1982`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 298–321.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def BaseRuleSet.merge (rs₁ rs₂ : BaseRuleSet) : BaseRuleSet where
  normRules := rs₁.normRules.merge rs₂.normRules
  unsafeRules := rs₁.unsafeRules.merge rs₂.unsafeRules
  safeRules := rs₁.safeRules.merge rs₂.safeRules
  forwardRules := rs₁.forwardRules.merge rs₂.forwardRules
  forwardRuleNames := rs₁.forwardRuleNames.merge rs₂.forwardRuleNames
  rulePatterns := rs₁.rulePatterns.merge rs₂.rulePatterns
  unfoldRules := rs₁.unfoldRules.mergeWith rs₂.unfoldRules
    λ _ unfoldThm?₁ _ => unfoldThm?₁
  ruleNames :=
    rs₁.ruleNames.mergeWith rs₂.ruleNames λ _ ns₁ ns₂ =>
      ns₁ ++ ns₂
  erased :=
    -- Add the erased rules from `rs₁` to `init`, except those rules which are
    -- present (and not erased) in `rs₂`.
    let go (rs₁ rs₂ : BaseRuleSet) (init : PHashSet RuleName) :
        PHashSet RuleName :=
      rs₁.erased.fold (init := init) λ x n =>
        match rs₂.ruleNames.find? n.name with
        | none => x.insert n
        | some ns =>
          if ns.contains n then x else x.insert n
    go rs₂ rs₁ $ go rs₁ rs₂ {}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RuleSet/Variant765d46993bf165937aaddbd1f9bd551719563351c7b6c22e82930ac243519e18.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RuleSet/Variant765d46993bf165937aaddbd1f9bd551719563351c7b6c22e82930ac243519e18.lean#L298).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aded577a0dad76b7a413b1a75ca6231b31d23e0b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
