## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3c85f24f64987cfd75b516dfddbdac19cf272582044b44bb7755d12d55c8caf4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 86–123.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def scoreToConfig (decl : Lean.Name) (score : Nat) : Aesop.Frontend.RuleConfig :=
  let (phase, priority) := match score with
    | 0 => (Aesop.PhaseName.norm, 0)  -- No hypotheses: this rule closes the goal immediately
    | s => (Aesop.PhaseName.safe, s)
  { term? := some (Lean.mkIdent decl)
    phase? := phase
    priority? := some (Aesop.Frontend.Priority.int priority)
    builder? := some (.regular .apply)
    builderOptions := {}
    ruleSets := ⟨#[`Bound]⟩ }

/-- Register a lemma as an `apply` rule for the `bound` tactic.

A lemma is appropriate for `bound` if it proves an inequality using structurally simpler
inequalities, "recursing" on the structure of the expressions involved, assuming positivity or
nonnegativity where useful. Examples include
1. `gcongr`-like inequalities over `<` and `≤` such as `f x ≤ f y` where `f` is monotone (note that
   `gcongr` supports other relations).
2. `mul_le_mul` which proves `a * b ≤ c * d` from `a ≤ c ∧ b ≤ d ∧ 0 ≤ b ∧ 0 ≤ c`
3. Positivity or nonnegativity inequalities such as `sub_nonneg`: `a ≤ b → 0 ≤ b - a`
4. Inequalities involving `1` such as `one_le_div` or `Real.one_le_exp`
5. Disjunctions where the natural recursion branches, such as `a ^ n ≤ a ^ m` when the inequality
   for `n,m` depends on whether `1 ≤ a ∨ a ≤ 1`.

Each `@[bound]` lemma is assigned a score based on the number and complexity of its hypotheses,
and the `aesop` implementation chooses lemmas with lower scores first:
1. Inequality hypotheses involving `0` add 1 to the score.
2. General inequalities add `10`.
3. Disjuctions `a ∨ b` add `100` plus the sum of the scores of `a` and `b`.

The functionality of `bound` overlaps with `positivity` and `gcongr`, but can jump back and forth
between `0 ≤ x` and `x ≤ y`-type inequalities.  For example, `bound` proves
  `0 ≤ c → b ≤ a → 0 ≤ a * c - b * c`
by turning the goal into `b * c ≤ a * c`, then using `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right`.  `bound` also
uses specialized lemmas for goals of the form `1 ≤ x, 1 < x, x ≤ 1, x < 1`.

See also `@[bound_forward]` which marks a lemma as a forward rule for `bound`: these lemmas are
applied to hypotheses to extract inequalities (e.g. `HasPowerSeriesOnBall.r_pos`). -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Attribute/Variant24030f6e5b6a83ed57c52e30f54360791a0fd6a27e5800cad8f12fb7023022d8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Attribute/Variant24030f6e5b6a83ed57c52e30f54360791a0fd6a27e5800cad8f12fb7023022d8.lean#L86).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
