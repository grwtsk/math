## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b44649034fb0b73718ed4e3281c0ddc70bf1ff609e79ed017860d2d79e5b8487`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 36–64.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def escapeAux (acc : String) (c : Char) : String :=
  -- escape ", \, \n and \r, keep all other characters ≥ 0x20 and render characters < 0x20 with \u
  if c = '"' then -- hack to prevent emacs from regarding the rest of the file as a string: "
    acc ++ "\\\""
  else if c = '\\' then
    acc ++ "\\\\"
  else if c = '\n' then
    acc ++ "\\n"
  else if c = '\x0d' then
    acc ++ "\\r"
  -- the c.val ≤ 0x10ffff check is technically redundant,
  -- since Lean chars are unicode scalar values ≤ 0x10ffff.
  -- as to whether c.val > 0xffff should be split up and encoded with multiple \u,
  -- the JSON standard is not definite: both directly printing the character
  -- and encoding it with multiple \u is allowed, and it is up to parsers to make the
  -- decision.
  else if 0x0020 ≤ c.val ∧ c.val ≤ 0x10ffff then
    acc.push c
  else
    let n := c.toNat;
    -- since c.val < 0x20 in this case, this conversion is more involved than necessary
    -- (but we keep it for completeness)
    let d1 := Nat.digitChar (n / 4096)
    let d2 := Nat.digitChar ((n % 4096) / 256)
    let d3 := Nat.digitChar ((n % 256) / 16)
    let d4 := Nat.digitChar (n % 16)
    acc ++ "\\u" |>.push d1 |>.push d2 |>.push d3 |>.push d4

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Printer/Variant9402526c6c73e54dfcfdb7c00b956fab8e13b5dabd201a1ede5341c7b4c9f2e3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Printer/Variant9402526c6c73e54dfcfdb7c00b956fab8e13b5dabd201a1ede5341c7b4c9f2e3.lean#L36).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d70bc85224d5672b43bb4fabc32b2d84c2ff8800` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
