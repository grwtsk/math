## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:88958cd8d89bb8fe9bd217df4e83f113c2391571ef2e3df74a50624ba76996d0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 439–446.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private unsafe def updateFunDeclImp (decl : FunDecl pu) (type : Expr) (params : Array (Param pu)) (value : Code pu) : CompilerM (FunDecl pu) := do
  if ptrEq type decl.type && ptrEq params decl.params && ptrEq value decl.value then
    return decl
  else
    let decl := ⟨decl.fvarId, decl.binderName, params, type, value⟩
    modifyLCtx fun lctx => lctx.addFunDecl decl
    return decl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CompilerM/Variant3890e874022d030873b509cc7e629b3ad4019447170d02ac36d3e1fffd18275a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CompilerM/Variant3890e874022d030873b509cc7e629b3ad4019447170d02ac36d3e1fffd18275a.lean#L439).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5149b8060c01dbd9721ee36ead44c9cde16a8bef` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
