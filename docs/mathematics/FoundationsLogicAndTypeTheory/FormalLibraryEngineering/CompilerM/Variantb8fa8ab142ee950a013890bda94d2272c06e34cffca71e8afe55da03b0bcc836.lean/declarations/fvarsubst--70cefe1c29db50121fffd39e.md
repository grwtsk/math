## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:17a8dc24e23e270e9d5036a79c2e3fc9839dfa586feccbd957ec76d0af5ee3df`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 188–200.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev FVarSubst (pu : Purity) := Std.HashMap FVarId (Arg pu)

/--
Replace the free variables in `e` using the given substitution.

If `translator = true`, then we assume the free variables occurring in the range of the substitution are in another
local context. For example, `translator = true` during internalization where we are making sure all free variables
in a given expression are replaced with new ones that do not collide with the ones in the current local context.

If `translator = false`, we assume the substitution contains free variable replacements in the same local context,
and given entries such as `x₁ ↦ x₂`, `x₂ ↦ x₃`, ..., `xₙ₋₁ ↦ xₙ`, and the expression `f x₁ x₂`, we want the resulting
expression to be `f xₙ xₙ`. We use this setting, for example, in the simplifier.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CompilerM/Variantb8fa8ab142ee950a013890bda94d2272c06e34cffca71e8afe55da03b0bcc836.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CompilerM/Variantb8fa8ab142ee950a013890bda94d2272c06e34cffca71e8afe55da03b0bcc836.lean#L188).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fd464ab07750f699b5847fb3bae2487d8c3668a0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
