## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fbd8b8917910c19b8d0d1d2b66634590897a6bba49f9d6fcc9ff5c0dba3d35de`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 29–47.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public inductive SimpleGroundArg where
  /--
  A simple tagged literal.
  -/
  | tagged (val : Nat)
  /--
  A reference to another declaration that was marked as a simple ground expression. This gets
  compiled to a reference to the mangled version of the name.
  -/
  | reference (n : Name)
  /--
  A reference directly to a raw C name. This gets compiled to a reference to the name directly.
  -/
  | rawReference (s : String)
  deriving Inhabited

/--
A simple ground expression that can be turned into a static initializer.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimpleGroundExpr/Variantbea06d50da41c2c3e9dee75a20bafb4966ee9f400f871a8ee1431b2279a3607d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimpleGroundExpr/Variantbea06d50da41c2c3e9dee75a20bafb4966ee9f400f871a8ee1431b2279a3607d.lean#L29).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a4553ccb6158850ca6d9e8653961e6cf94c0274` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
