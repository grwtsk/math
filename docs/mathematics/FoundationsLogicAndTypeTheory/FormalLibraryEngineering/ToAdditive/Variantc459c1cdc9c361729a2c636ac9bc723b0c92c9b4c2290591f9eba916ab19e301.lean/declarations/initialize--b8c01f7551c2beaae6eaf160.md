## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `initialize` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5dc8d6b6b5899884a58b28505117c3ada0d68bcfb1a97c9e5a50c61448a6fd36`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 195–218.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
initialize relevantArgAttr : NameMapExtension Nat ←
  registerNameMapAttribute {
    name := `to_additive_relevant_arg
    descr := "Auxiliary attribute for `to_additive` stating" ++
      " which arguments are the types with a multiplicative structure."
    add := fun
    | _, `(attr| to_additive_relevant_arg $id) => pure <| id.1.isNatLit?.get!.pred
    | _, _ => throwUnsupportedSyntax }

/--
An attribute that stores all the declarations that deal with numeric literals on variable types.

Numeral literals occur in expressions without type information, so in order to decide whether `1`
needs to be changed to `0`, the context around the numeral is relevant.
Most numerals will be in an `OfNat.ofNat` application, though tactics can add numeral literals
inside arbitrary functions. By default we assume that we do not change numerals, unless it is
in a function application with the `to_additive_change_numeral` attribute.

`@[to_additive_change_numeral n₁ ...]` should be added to all functions that take one or more
numerals as argument that should be changed if `additiveTest` succeeds on the first argument,
i.e. when the numeral is only translated if the first argument is a variable
(or consists of variables).
The arguments `n₁ ...` are the positions of the numeral arguments (starting counting from 1).

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ToAdditive/Variantc459c1cdc9c361729a2c636ac9bc723b0c92c9b4c2290591f9eba916ab19e301.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ToAdditive/Variantc459c1cdc9c361729a2c636ac9bc723b0c92c9b4c2290591f9eba916ab19e301.lean#L195).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7854d85a34a624442418891036ea1a7749a86071` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
