## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:33cba4c19b92b0d1aaa07a0899ddc5a81c6e37436c25c6f7a47c53dc79ee5555`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 288–323.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
unsafe def additiveTestUnsafe (findTranslation? : Name → Option Name)
  (ignore : Name → Option (List ℕ)) (e : Expr) : Bool :=
  let rec visit (e : Expr) (inApp := false) : OptionT FindM Unit := do
    if e.isConst then
      if inApp || (findTranslation? e.constName).isSome then
        failure
      else
        return
    checkVisited e
    match e with
    | x@(.app e a)       =>
        visit e true <|> do
          -- make sure that we don't treat `(fun x => α) (n + 1)` as a type that depends on `Nat`
          guard !x.isConstantApplication
          if let some n := e.getAppFn.constName? then
            if let some l := ignore n then
              if e.getAppNumArgs + 1 ∈ l then
                failure
          visit a
    | .lam _ _ t _       => visit t
    | .forallE _ _ t _   => visit t
    | .letE _ _ e body _ => visit e <|> visit body
    | .mdata _ b         => visit b
    | .proj _ _ b        => visit b
    | _                  => failure
  Option.isNone <| Id.run <| (visit e).run' mkPtrSet

/--
`additiveTest e` tests whether the expression `e` contains no constant
`nm` that is not applied to any arguments, and such that `translations.find?[nm] = none`.
This is used in `@[to_additive]` for deciding which subexpressions to transform: we only transform
constants if `additiveTest` applied to their first argument returns `true`.
This means we will replace expression applied to e.g. `α` or `α × β`, but not when applied to
e.g. `ℕ` or `ℝ × α`.
We ignore all arguments specified by the `ignore` `NameMap`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ToAdditive/Variantc459c1cdc9c361729a2c636ac9bc723b0c92c9b4c2290591f9eba916ab19e301.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ToAdditive/Variantc459c1cdc9c361729a2c636ac9bc723b0c92c9b4c2290591f9eba916ab19e301.lean#L288).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7854d85a34a624442418891036ea1a7749a86071` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
