## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:95678b7702e7a632c4c770d554183c1b036973d81f2076fde6f6618baffe2fbf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 616–623.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def copyInstanceAttribute (src tgt : Name) : CoreM Unit := do
  if (← isInstance src) then
    let prio := (← getInstancePriority? src).getD 100
    let attr_kind := (← getInstanceAttrKind? src).getD .global
    trace[to_additive_detail] "Making {tgt} an instance with priority {prio}."
    addInstance tgt attr_kind prio |>.run'

/-- Warn the user when the multiplicative declaration has an attribute. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ToAdditive/Variant05fa1ae8b09abcecf394188a88485420dc28af83bd63c3a8132e40af02c1759e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ToAdditive/Variant05fa1ae8b09abcecf394188a88485420dc28af83bd63c3a8132e40af02c1759e.lean#L616).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8d2dbfc21ec31d53c72b1ae3cdcea7b450370dfe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
