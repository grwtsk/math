## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7be5717cc90bb8bd56849879369f2138351abceead928536ec5b1242f3bdbe21`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 683–704.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getMatchCore (root : Std.HashMap Key TrieIndex) (e : Expr) :
    MatchM α (MatchResult α) := do
  let result ← getStarResult root
  let (k, args) ← MatchClone.getMatchKeyArgs e (root := true) (← read)
  let cases :=
    match k with
    | .star  =>
      #[]
    /- See note about "dep-arrow vs arrow" at `getMatchLoop` -/
    | .arrow =>
      #[] |> pushRootCase root .other #[]
          |> pushRootCase root k args
    | _ =>
      #[] |> pushRootCase root k args
  getMatchLoop cases result

/--
  Find values that match `e` in `d`.

  The results are ordered so that the longest matches in terms of number of
  non-star keys are first with ties going to earlier operators first.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LazyDiscrTree/Variante44c04202539fc87475a9b7a6b8525c71e5aef10390a4c219f35f07069eb73cb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LazyDiscrTree/Variante44c04202539fc87475a9b7a6b8525c71e5aef10390a4c219f35f07069eb73cb.lean#L683).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c26b2f62a5e0c9a3df2b82e57609fa8c991a160f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
