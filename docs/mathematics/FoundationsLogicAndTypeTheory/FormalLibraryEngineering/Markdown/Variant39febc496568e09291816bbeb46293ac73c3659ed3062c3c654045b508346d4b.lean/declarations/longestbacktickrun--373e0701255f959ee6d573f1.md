## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7e3fad105549e22016ce052a4252d44d8452934ceee287026d162075b7e5fb5b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 241–258.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def longestBacktickRun (str : String) : Nat := Id.run do
  let mut longest := 0
  let mut current := 0
  let mut iter := str.startPos
  while h : ¬iter.IsAtEnd do
    let c := iter.get h
    iter := iter.next h
    if c == '`' then
      current := current + 1
    else
      longest := max longest current
      current := 0
  return max longest current

/--
A run of `` ` `` characters one longer than any run inside `str` (with a minimum of `atLeast`),
suitable for use as a code block fence or a delimiter for inline code.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Markdown/Variant39febc496568e09291816bbeb46293ac73c3659ed3062c3c654045b508346d4b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Markdown/Variant39febc496568e09291816bbeb46293ac73c3659ed3062c3c654045b508346d4b.lean#L241).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `553ddfe0a26ffc1d8037306db72affadea409006` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
