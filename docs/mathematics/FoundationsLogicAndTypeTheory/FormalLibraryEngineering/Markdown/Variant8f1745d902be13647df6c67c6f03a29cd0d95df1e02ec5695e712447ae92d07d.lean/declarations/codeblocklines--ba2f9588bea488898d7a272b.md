## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dd833cecad8b5aed08b5847901ab40da43a7e8f27478f5b1d52347a4f801b171`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 271–282.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def codeBlockLines (str : String) : Array String := Id.run do
  let fence := fenceFor 2 str
  let body := splitNewlines str
  -- Drop a trailing empty so the closing fence isn't preceded by a blank line.
  let body := if body.size > 0 && body.back!.isEmpty then body.pop else body
  #[fence] ++ body ++ #[fence]

/--
Splits off the leading run of whitespace from an inline tree, returning the whitespace as a plain
string and the remainder as a new inline. This allows emphasis to be applied to strings that start
or end with whitespace, taking the flanking rules of Markdown into account.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Markdown/Variant8f1745d902be13647df6c67c6f03a29cd0d95df1e02ec5695e712447ae92d07d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Markdown/Variant8f1745d902be13647df6c67c6f03a29cd0d95df1e02ec5695e712447ae92d07d.lean#L271).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `57f92f0e9159092ddf57c765816558eb59d974c4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
