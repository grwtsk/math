## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ad89313e8537fb7e36a48e0dbe2eaa7045ecb75524bc5c2bc5b2858e8e704ec0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 589–599.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public def withRendererFallback (fallback : MarkdownM (Array String)) (act : MarkdownM (Array String)) :
    MarkdownM (Array String) := do
  -- `tryCatchRuntimeEx` catches ordinary errors and runtime timeouts (the heartbeat budget) while
  -- letting interrupts (cancellation) propagate so the enclosing request still aborts. On failure
  -- the state is restored so any partial output the renderer accumulated (e.g. footnotes) is
  -- discarded before the fallback content is rendered.
  let saved ← getThe MarkdownM.State
  tryCatchRuntimeEx (withMdRendererBudget act) fun _ => do
    set saved
    fallback

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Markdown/Variant8f1745d902be13647df6c67c6f03a29cd0d95df1e02ec5695e712447ae92d07d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Markdown/Variant8f1745d902be13647df6c67c6f03a29cd0d95df1e02ec5695e712447ae92d07d.lean#L589).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `57f92f0e9159092ddf57c765816558eb59d974c4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
