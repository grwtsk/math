## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:616d6d125dffc0a57a6b5826c37a84c8e9000f65fce03b5e8646e744b161a146`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 932–939.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def incDepth (mctx : MetavarContext) (allowLevelAssignments := false) : MetavarContext :=
  let depth := mctx.depth + 1
  let levelAssignDepth :=
    if allowLevelAssignments then mctx.levelAssignDepth else depth
  { mctx with depth, levelAssignDepth }

namespace MkBinding

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MetavarContext/Variantc077803ff87931e95ab13401b9119317a4268206814ace2a2d9586c9786355af.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MetavarContext/Variantc077803ff87931e95ab13401b9119317a4268206814ace2a2d9586c9786355af.lean#L932).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ad97d82016c98fecf071011eac4662b21b2dbf2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
