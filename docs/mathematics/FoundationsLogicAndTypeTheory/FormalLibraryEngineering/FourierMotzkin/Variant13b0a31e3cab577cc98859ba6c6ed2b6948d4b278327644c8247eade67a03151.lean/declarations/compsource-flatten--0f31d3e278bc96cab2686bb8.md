## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9d19af87625f3396ab7b16562513c197f787be7d2cb0192626618e6519a0511f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–93.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def CompSource.flatten : CompSource → Std.HashMap Nat Nat
  | (CompSource.assump n) => (∅ : Std.HashMap Nat Nat).insert n 1
  | (CompSource.add c1 c2) =>
      (CompSource.flatten c1).mergeWith (fun _ b b' => b + b') (CompSource.flatten c2)
  | (CompSource.scale n c) => (CompSource.flatten c).mapVal (fun _ v => v * n)

/-- Formats a `CompSource` for printing. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FourierMotzkin/Variant13b0a31e3cab577cc98859ba6c6ed2b6948d4b278327644c8247eade67a03151.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FourierMotzkin/Variant13b0a31e3cab577cc98859ba6c6ed2b6948d4b278327644c8247eade67a03151.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f4fe808c4c6ada79cabb2e085c2a7df8a8afb5a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
