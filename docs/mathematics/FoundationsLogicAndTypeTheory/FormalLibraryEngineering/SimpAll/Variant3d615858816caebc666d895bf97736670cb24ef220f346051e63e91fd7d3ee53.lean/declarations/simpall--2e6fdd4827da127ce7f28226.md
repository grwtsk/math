## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9a5d224bd35148eaea474b3f1d60a2f3b4dc5ddbd5af99114688d963c8ae5098`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 151–158.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def simpAll (mvarId : MVarId) (ctx : Simp.Context) (simprocs : SimprocsArray := #[]) (stats : Stats := {}) : MetaM (Option MVarId × Stats) := do
  mvarId.withContext do
    let (r, s) ← SimpAll.main.run { stats with mvarId, ctx, simprocs }
    if let .some mvarIdNew := r then
      if ctx.config.failIfUnchanged && mvarId == mvarIdNew then
        throwError "simp_all made no progress"
    return (r, { s with })

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimpAll/Variant3d615858816caebc666d895bf97736670cb24ef220f346051e63e91fd7d3ee53.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimpAll/Variant3d615858816caebc666d895bf97736670cb24ef220f346051e63e91fd7d3ee53.lean#L151).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7cb9d3e7fc4618537374ff683593639a106d3175` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
