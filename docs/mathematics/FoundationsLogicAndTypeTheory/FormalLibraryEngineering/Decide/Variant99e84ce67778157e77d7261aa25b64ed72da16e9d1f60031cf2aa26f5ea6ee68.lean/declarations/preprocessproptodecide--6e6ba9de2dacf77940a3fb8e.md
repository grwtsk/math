## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0dcc3a49980b51e45eb62311af6b40fea5fc02ceb140e73319b7596ea099e94c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 24–38.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def preprocessPropToDecide (expectedType : Expr) : TermElabM Expr := do
  let mut expectedType ← instantiateMVars expectedType
  if expectedType.hasFVar then
    expectedType ← zetaReduce expectedType
  if expectedType.hasMVar then
    throwError "Expected type must not contain metavariables{indentExpr expectedType}"
  if expectedType.hasFVar then
    throwError m!"Expected type must not contain free variables{indentExpr expectedType}"
      ++ .hint' m!"Use the `+revert` option to automatically clean up and revert free variables"
  return expectedType

/--
Given the decidable instance `inst`, reduces it and returns a decidable instance expression
in whnf that can be regarded as the reason for the failure of `inst` to fully reduce.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Decide/Variant99e84ce67778157e77d7261aa25b64ed72da16e9d1f60031cf2aa26f5ea6ee68.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Decide/Variant99e84ce67778157e77d7261aa25b64ed72da16e9d1f60031cf2aa26f5ea6ee68.lean#L24).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `929dd0a01dc12e7df21860ef791f6a2cf2a038c0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
