## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:af2aa0aee55c2a258ec1efc89143fee02e9e4102addb8be5013ebf6b2e6ab387`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 131–142.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def AdmissibilityWeightSound
    {Morph : Type uMorph} {Factorization : Type uFactor}
    {Edge : Type uEdge}
    (sieve : FactoringSieve Morph Factorization)
    (occurs : Edge → Factorization → Prop)
    (W : TraversalWeight Edge) : Prop :=
  ∀ e, W.weight e > 0 →
    ∃ f,
      sieve.accepts (sieve.factorMorph f) ∧
      occurs e f

/-- Occurrence-only weight correctness, used at transported stages. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Sieve/Variant8131f98138d0f4aa0bf259be3f14bce558851c77ff5399f55f53ed5daa1378c8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Sieve/Variant8131f98138d0f4aa0bf259be3f14bce558851c77ff5399f55f53ed5daa1378c8.lean#L131).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d9427eba94fdb0ece26e90b26aa4adda7e243100` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
