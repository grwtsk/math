## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:066b6685da32ec9abe447c55b82820ea1158980a633b095ded07642e93d78ec3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 832–839.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[inline] def mapCoreM [MonadControlT CoreM m] [Monad m] (f : forall {α}, CoreM α → CoreM α) {α} (x : m α) : m α :=
  controlAt CoreM fun runInBase => f <| runInBase x

/--
Returns `true` if the given message kind has not been reported in the message log,
and then mark it as logged. Otherwise, returns `false`.
We use this API to ensure we don't log the same kind of warning multiple times.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CoreM/Variant0e94919972c60e8f2bdc73ecc9845a745c9a3373fce4069b9e27ae52560c0a7a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CoreM/Variant0e94919972c60e8f2bdc73ecc9845a745c9a3373fce4069b9e27ae52560c0a7a.lean#L832).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `61d372630f94a66febd188f998aa81b1361a4ce0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
