## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9f208618-e6b1-b321-0d9e-6ec49dc2b616`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–68.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem spectral_lower_of_head_tail {S head tail : ℝ}
    (hdecomposition : S = head + tail) (hhead : 0 ≤ head)
    (htail : |tail| ≤ tailBound) : -(1 / 500000 : ℝ) ≤ S := by
  have htailLower := (abs_le.mp htail).1
  have hsmall := tailBound_lt
  linarith

/-- Exact scalar transport retaining the ordinary-square source identity and
the full gamma upper bound. Arithmetic alone requires no extra regularity. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FiniteCertificate/Variant5f7f33f4fc7b58313203de434e98a4f584b9557921ceb0999de8414235f524db.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FiniteCertificate/Variant5f7f33f4fc7b58313203de434e98a4f584b9557921ceb0999de8414235f524db.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f8ecfd80cdaf11e906c1120bc83c74cb37d0601c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
