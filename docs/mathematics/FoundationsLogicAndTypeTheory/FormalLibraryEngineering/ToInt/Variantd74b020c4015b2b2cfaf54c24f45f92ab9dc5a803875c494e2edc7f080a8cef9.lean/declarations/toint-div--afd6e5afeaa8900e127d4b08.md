## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e89ea37f329fbd50db795a9a91d9adfb4f897c8b6d1d9a51a153958a97a673cf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 312–322.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class ToInt.Div (α : Type u) [Div α] (I : outParam IntInterval) [ToInt α I] where
  /--
  The embedding takes division to division (without needing to wrap into the range interval).
  One might expect a `wrap` on the right hand side,
  but in practice this stronger statement is usually true.
  -/
  toInt_div : ∀ x y : α, toInt (x / y) = toInt x / toInt y

/--
The embedding into the integers is monotone.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ToInt/Variantd74b020c4015b2b2cfaf54c24f45f92ab9dc5a803875c494e2edc7f080a8cef9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ToInt/Variantd74b020c4015b2b2cfaf54c24f45f92ab9dc5a803875c494e2edc7f080a8cef9.lean#L312).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a266a720e1382a16d4c2fde72b19fad17fde4aca` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
