## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2ff26e2a3d4c55199335bc4de3417cb184ac6d93cc14e3e01b08defd31055772`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 442–462.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def declValToWhereFinally (declVal : Syntax) : TermElabM WhereFinallyView := withRef declVal do
  if declVal.isOfKind ``Parser.Command.declValSimple then
    mkWhereFinallyView ⟨declVal[3][0]⟩
  else if declVal.isOfKind ``Parser.Command.declValEqns then
    mkWhereFinallyView ⟨declVal[0][2][0]⟩
  else if declVal.isOfKind ``Parser.Command.whereStructInst then
    mkWhereFinallyView ⟨declVal[2][0]⟩
  else
    return .none

/--
Runs `k` with a restricted local context where only section variables from `vars` are included that
* are directly referenced in any `headers`,
* are included in `sc.includedVars` (via the `include` command),
* are directly referenced in any variable included by these rules, OR
* are instance-implicit variables that only reference section variables included by these rules AND
  are not listed in `sc.omittedVars` (via `omit`; note that `omit` also subtracts from
  `sc.includedVars`).

If `check` is false, no exceptions will be produced.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MutualDef/Variant2d76c3300c8c3963cee5cc589e2dbdda87f32fd1f096a4f8804a525910b9bb1e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MutualDef/Variant2d76c3300c8c3963cee5cc589e2dbdda87f32fd1f096a4f8804a525910b9bb1e.lean#L442).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `95524f4693dae3016627447f92c8871548cdca73` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
