## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b3781a54498f45a74f37a3972566bdda1bd645f836a546b209138c397b5852a1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 628–635.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def typeHasRecFun (type : Expr) (funFVars : Array Expr) (letRecsToLift : List LetRecToLift) : Option FVarId :=
  let occ? := type.find? fun e => match e with
    | Expr.fvar fvarId => funFVars.contains e || letRecsToLift.any fun toLift => toLift.fvarId == fvarId
    | _ => false
  match occ? with
  | some (Expr.fvar fvarId) => some fvarId
  | _ => none

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MutualDef/Variant73a278e79b6fa2a355c3076c40eec8f0cd607c8b68f21e1fa344b56d14e6c3b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MutualDef/Variant73a278e79b6fa2a355c3076c40eec8f0cd607c8b68f21e1fa344b56d14e6c3b9.lean#L628).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `81f3d84a62a9cfc1ef4502eb8c2e6b69618d9b2f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
