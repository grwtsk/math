## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c4670a7187fd185dc07cbebeee0edd5796459fd0adda9721b4858e03f577d92c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1167–1176.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def checkAllDeclNamesDistinct (preDefs : Array PreDefinition) : TermElabM Unit := do
  let mut names : Std.HashMap Name Syntax := {}
  for preDef in preDefs do
    let userName := privateToUserName preDef.declName
    if let some dupStx := names[userName]? then
      let errorMsg := m!"`mutual` block contains two declarations of the same name `{userName}`"
      Lean.logErrorAt dupStx errorMsg
      throwErrorAt preDef.ref errorMsg
    names := names.insert userName preDef.ref

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MutualDef/Variant73a278e79b6fa2a355c3076c40eec8f0cd607c8b68f21e1fa344b56d14e6c3b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/MutualDef/Variant73a278e79b6fa2a355c3076c40eec8f0cd607c8b68f21e1fa344b56d14e6c3b9.lean#L1167).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `81f3d84a62a9cfc1ef4502eb8c2e6b69618d9b2f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
