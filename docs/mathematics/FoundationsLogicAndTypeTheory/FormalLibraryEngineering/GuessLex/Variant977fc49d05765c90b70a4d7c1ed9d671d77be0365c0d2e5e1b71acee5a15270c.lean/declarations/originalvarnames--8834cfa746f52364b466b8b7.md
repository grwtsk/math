## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5bcae8e74c91fe588ac124f2820247fa3d920e29925eab10724798b66827ff65`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 93–109.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def originalVarNames (preDef : PreDefinition) : MetaM (Array Name) := do
  lambdaTelescope preDef.value fun xs _ => xs.mapM (·.fvarId!.getUserName)

/--
Given the original parameter names from `originalVarNames`, find
good variable names to be used when talking about termination measures:
Use user-given parameter names if present; use x1...xn otherwise.

The names ought to accessible (no macro scopes) and fresh wrt to the current environment,
so that with `showInferredTerminationBy` we can print them to the user reliably.
We do that by appending `'` as needed.

It is possible (but unlikely without malice) that some of the user-given names
shadow each other, and the guessed relation refers to the wrong one. In that
case, the user gets to keep both pieces (and may have to rename variables).

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/GuessLex/Variant977fc49d05765c90b70a4d7c1ed9d671d77be0365c0d2e5e1b71acee5a15270c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/GuessLex/Variant977fc49d05765c90b70a4d7c1ed9d671d77be0365c0d2e5e1b71acee5a15270c.lean#L93).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d7e8f582f2bcabce625f8ec04c422992da61f27e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
