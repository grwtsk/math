## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c61a19d7f600022a7501795bfc79db00ce338fc9e9a9bdfa782166b5c5a012f1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 514–523.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def RecCallCache.eval (rc: RecCallCache) (callerMeasureIdx calleeMeasureIdx : Nat) : MetaM GuessLexRel := do
  -- Check the cache first
  if let Option.some res := (← rc.cache.get)[callerMeasureIdx]![calleeMeasureIdx]! then
    return res
  else
    let res ← evalRecCall  rc.callerName rc.decrTactic? rc.callerMeasures rc.calleeMeasures rc.rcc callerMeasureIdx calleeMeasureIdx
    rc.cache.modify (·.modify callerMeasureIdx (·.set! calleeMeasureIdx res))
    return res

/-- Print a single cache entry as a string, without forcing it -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/GuessLex/Variant82372c368866c1b7ba7dc08c7cd30ced30fd082f6b10066cc3ec3e0b238d01a2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/GuessLex/Variant82372c368866c1b7ba7dc08c7cd30ced30fd082f6b10066cc3ec3e0b238d01a2.lean#L514).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8655cf0708eda72c2b5d9dd51524ab5abee9098b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
