## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2c6ad6a106067419868d3c48b16262a00521e8a1a5ca1aa8666c6ae93de9a7fd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 551–562.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def handleSemanticTokensFull (_ : SemanticTokensParams) (_ : SemanticTokensState)
    : RequestM (LspResponse SemanticTokens × SemanticTokensState) := do
  let ctx ← read
  let doc ← readDoc
  -- Only grabs the finished prefix so that we do not need to wait for elaboration to complete
  -- for the full file before sending a response. This means that the response will be incomplete,
  -- which we mitigate by regularly sending `workspace/semanticTokens/refresh` requests in the
  -- `FileWorker` to tell the client to re-compute the semantic tokens.
  let (snaps, _, isComplete) ← doc.cmdSnaps.getFinishedPrefixWithTimeout 3000 (cancelTks := ctx.cancelTk.cancellationTasks)
  let response ← computeSemanticTokens doc 0 none snaps
  return ({ response, isComplete }, ⟨⟩)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SemanticHighlighting/Variantf685de465227aeae4c173ce4460bdbee116ac284e687fa8d8e8df227328d17a6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SemanticHighlighting/Variantf685de465227aeae4c173ce4460bdbee116ac284e687fa8d8e8df227328d17a6.lean#L551).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dbfe4cbe254b55b50d0905e8465111920d0e579e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
