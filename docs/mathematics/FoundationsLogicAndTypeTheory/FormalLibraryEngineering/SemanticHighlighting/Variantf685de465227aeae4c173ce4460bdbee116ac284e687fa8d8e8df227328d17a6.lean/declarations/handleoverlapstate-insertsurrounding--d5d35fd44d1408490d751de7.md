## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:aeaf80cf66586ceb256693070e278dbfc296914e820ad6865d86d563157ecb54`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–133.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def HandleOverlapState.insertSurrounding
    (st : HandleOverlapState) (s : AbsoluteLspSemanticToken) : HandleOverlapState :=
  { st with surrounding := go st.surrounding }
where
  go
    | [] => [s]
    | x :: xs =>
      if s.tailPos < x.tailPos then s :: x :: xs else x :: go xs

/--
Handles state transitions that are not due to a new token. If `nextToken?` is `none`, then there are
no more tokens to process, so all remaining transitions occur. If it is `some t`, then state
transitions only occur for token boundaries less than the `t`'s start.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SemanticHighlighting/Variantf685de465227aeae4c173ce4460bdbee116ac284e687fa8d8e8df227328d17a6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SemanticHighlighting/Variantf685de465227aeae4c173ce4460bdbee116ac284e687fa8d8e8df227328d17a6.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dbfe4cbe254b55b50d0905e8465111920d0e579e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
