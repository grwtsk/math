## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `syntax` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:69a4fc7b19915769ea757457ff1d883ab0f83e467c694cb4d209de459fcb0253`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 201–203.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
syntax (name := refoldLetStx) "refold_let" (ppSpace colGt term:max)*
  (ppSpace Parser.Tactic.location)? : tactic

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DefEqTransformations/Variant26a4506dd6902fe57ce69d9168ea550fd9ba42d78c5b5e5a9dfa3cd04b45c6f1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DefEqTransformations/Variant26a4506dd6902fe57ce69d9168ea550fd9ba42d78c5b5e5a9dfa3cd04b45c6f1.lean#L201).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b3eee29846a19de8e7282b94550f76b79f5a98e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
