## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9a9daaadba8588f0b49fb8044cea3518cafabeee9ad9ef9c080da96626860fd0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 247–263.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def similarNames (x : Name) (xs : Array Name) : Array Name := Id.run do
  let s := x.toString
  let mut threshold := if s.length < 5 then 1 else if s.length < 8 then 2 else 3
  let mut candidates := #[]
  for x in xs do
    if let some d ← levenshtein s x.toString threshold then
      if d < threshold then threshold := d
      if d ≤ threshold then candidates := candidates.push (x, d)
  -- Only keep the smallest distance
  return candidates.filterMap fun (x, d) => do
    guard (d ≤ threshold)
    pure x

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Builtin/Variantc653d8324f2e697d8d94be98c110cfdb2037e779dd1b45b683c6b6d8d609dac6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Builtin/Variantc653d8324f2e697d8d94be98c110cfdb2037e779dd1b45b683c6b6d8d609dac6.lean#L247).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `128001ebaa848e230bfbb1d7ad55d36ebf90f010` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
