## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1376bd5e36bfa878f2abb454d3477c919676b8d3680f57db888545a4a41f7465`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1369–1386.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def suggestName (code : StrLit) : DocM (Array CodeSuggestion) := do
  let stx ← parseStrLit identFn code
  let mut suggestions := #[]
  try
    discard <| realizeGlobalConstNoOverload stx
    suggestions := suggestions.push <| .mk ``name none none
  catch
    | _ =>
    if let some (_, []) := (← resolveLocalName stx.getId) then
      suggestions := suggestions.push <| .mk ``name none none
    else if stx.getId.components.length == 1 then
      suggestions := suggestions.push <| .mk ``given none none
  return suggestions

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Builtin/Variantc653d8324f2e697d8d94be98c110cfdb2037e779dd1b45b683c6b6d8d609dac6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Builtin/Variantc653d8324f2e697d8d94be98c110cfdb2037e779dd1b45b683c6b6d8d609dac6.lean#L1369).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `128001ebaa848e230bfbb1d7ad55d36ebf90f010` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
