## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1a6540ebaec1d5e1e510ac2da91d5f2a5b29e050f5f2a504577c820ea936b020`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 136–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def pushFormatError (fs : Array FormatError) (f : FormatError) : Array FormatError :=
  -- If there are no errors already, we simply add the new one.
  if fs.isEmpty then fs.push f else
  let back := fs.back!
  -- If the latest error is of a different kind than the new one, we simply add the new one.
  if back.msg != f.msg || back.srcNat - back.length != f.srcNat then fs.push f else
  -- Otherwise, we are adding a further error of the same kind and we therefore merge the two.
  fs.pop.push {back with length := back.length + f.length, srcStartPos := f.srcEndPos}

/--
Scan the two input strings `L` and `M`, assuming `M` is the pretty-printed version of `L`.
This almost means that `L` and `M` only differ in whitespace.

While scanning the two strings, accumulate any discrepancies --- with some heuristics to avoid
flagging some line-breaking changes.
(The pretty-printer does not always produce desirably formatted code.)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Whitespace/Variantf6643b8bc0d7a3ef7949255573e87c942ce21549570454e1f7e49c51211f2978.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Whitespace/Variantf6643b8bc0d7a3ef7949255573e87c942ce21549570454e1f7e49c51211f2978.lean#L136).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `862bf459d4369a75a40c57fd512fb4b8dbf9ea33` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
