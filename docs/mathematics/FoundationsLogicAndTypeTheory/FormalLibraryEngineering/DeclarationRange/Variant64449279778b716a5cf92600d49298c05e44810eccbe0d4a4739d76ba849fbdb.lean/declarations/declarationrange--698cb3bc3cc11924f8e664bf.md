## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:44f034e86f5944998b3115b98cda1502cd7b995e9d6d83bc9a07f6ec377eaef5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 30–41.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure DeclarationRange where
  pos          : Position
  /-- A precomputed UTF-16 `character` field as in `Lean.Lsp.Position`. We need to store this
  because LSP clients want us to report the range in terms of UTF-16, but converting a Unicode
  codepoint stored in `Lean.Position` to UTF-16 requires loading and mapping the target source
  file, which is IO-heavy. -/
  charUtf16    : Nat
  endPos       : Position
  /-- See `charUtf16`. -/
  endCharUtf16 : Nat

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DeclarationRange/Variant64449279778b716a5cf92600d49298c05e44810eccbe0d4a4739d76ba849fbdb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DeclarationRange/Variant64449279778b716a5cf92600d49298c05e44810eccbe0d4a4739d76ba849fbdb.lean#L30).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e38debc4a6de2f72254617acfea01787fb477c7f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
