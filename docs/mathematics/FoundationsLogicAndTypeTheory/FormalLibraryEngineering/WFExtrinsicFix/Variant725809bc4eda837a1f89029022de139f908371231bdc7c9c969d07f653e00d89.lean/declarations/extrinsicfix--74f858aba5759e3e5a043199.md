## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2659fb7ab9ae64c0bf1482efab8bc3df0d5c93bd633fbbed4de21c90a3ce6ea7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 75–84.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public def extrinsicFix [∀ a, Nonempty (C a)] (R : α → α → Prop)
    (F : ∀ a, (∀ a', R a' a → C a') → C a) (a : α) : C a :=
  open scoped Classical in
  if h : WellFounded R then
    h.fix F a
  else
    -- Return `opaqueFix R F a` so that `implemented_by opaqueFix` is sound.
    -- In effect, `extrinsicFix` is opaque if `WellFounded R` is false.
    opaqueFix R F a

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/WFExtrinsicFix/Variant725809bc4eda837a1f89029022de139f908371231bdc7c9c969d07f653e00d89.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/WFExtrinsicFix/Variant725809bc4eda837a1f89029022de139f908371231bdc7c9c969d07f653e00d89.lean#L75).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a7bf4b8d8915578dd510e0db9d11107bf226272` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
