## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e63206b00abc6982e845d4e3e483185acb268bb7c9c7707bbb5844b55a77e620`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 313–326.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure RunnerState where
  uri : DocumentUri
  -- Whether we have waited for the server via `sync/collectDiagnostics/waitFor` since the last
  -- change; we should only send out further changes when we are in such a deterministic state.
  synced : Bool
  rpcSessionId : Option UInt64
  lineNo : Nat
  lastActualLineNo : Nat
  pos : Lsp.Position
  method : String
  params : String
  versionNo : Nat
  requestNo : Nat

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Runner/Variant4ed78e35b7e5c87c5b907e845a62bcb7d0815fd06478713852adec8b663e5a5e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Runner/Variant4ed78e35b7e5c87c5b907e845a62bcb7d0815fd06478713852adec8b663e5a5e.lean#L313).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a9f5df3c760826bac21e5719bac746d9ad661c0b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
