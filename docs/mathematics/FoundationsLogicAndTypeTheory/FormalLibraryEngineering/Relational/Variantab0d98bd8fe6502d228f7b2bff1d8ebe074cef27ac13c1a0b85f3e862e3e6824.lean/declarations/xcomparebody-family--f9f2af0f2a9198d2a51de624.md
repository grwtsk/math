## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7dec4d97-dd0f-66f8-853c-e8609d1b4ab1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1068–1073.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem xCompareBody_family {x y : Expr S}
    (hx : HasType P Γ x (R.channel.logicalType R.probe.carrier)) (mx : WellModed γ x .data)
    (hy : HasType P Γ y (R.channel.logicalType R.probe.carrier)) (my : WellModed γ y .data) :
    L.Family (R.channel.predicateType R.probe.carrier) (R.xCompareBody L.code KY.code KP.code
      x y) :=
  (H.leBody_family KY KP hx mx).code_iff (H.leBody_family KY KP hy my)
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Relational/Variantab0d98bd8fe6502d228f7b2bff1d8ebe074cef27ac13c1a0b85f3e862e3e6824.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Relational/Variantab0d98bd8fe6502d228f7b2bff1d8ebe074cef27ac13c1a0b85f3e862e3e6824.lean#L1068).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c9d32b0e3dabc780d607f55675e04d4b981c7eca` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
