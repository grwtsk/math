## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9038cf16-a973-0c3e-ff63-6e0e63f7460d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 914–922.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem body_instantiate (a : Expr S) :
    R.body.instantiate a = R.funPath.apply (R.funType (R.lifting.project a)) := by
  simp only [body,Expr.instantiate,DataWrapper.apply_subst,funType_subst,
    PositiveDataWrapper.project_subst,Expr.subst,Expr.single,DataWrapper.instantiate_raise,
    PositiveDataWrapper.instantiate_raise,instantiate_raise]

variable {Γ : List (Expr S)} {γ : Nat → Mode} {C : Set (Set S)}
  (L : LogicSetup P Γ γ C) (I J k p n g : Set S)
/-- Formation of the probe paths, lifting, and tail along their designated profile vertices. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Channels/Variant77f59dff53d55490f274d81f85d650de36347bea9014013cc9e21a66d5656b0f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Channels/Variant77f59dff53d55490f274d81f85d650de36347bea9014013cc9e21a66d5656b0f.lean#L914).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7b57b14a0605c045659f8c8f73d9431aca4f17ad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
