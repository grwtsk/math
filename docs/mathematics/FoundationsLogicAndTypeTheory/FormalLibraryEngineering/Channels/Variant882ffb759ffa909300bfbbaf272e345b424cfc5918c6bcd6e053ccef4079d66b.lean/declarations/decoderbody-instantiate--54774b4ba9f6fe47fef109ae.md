## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a327a391-3b13-2876-5004-35607e53d25e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 708–718.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem decoderBody_instantiate (L : LogicCode S) (T bp c : Expr S) :
    (R.decoderBody L T bp).instantiate c = R.first.observe (R.big T) bp (R.tagged L 0 T c) := by
  simp only [decoderBody,Expr.compose_instantiate,embedBody_instantiate,
    DataWrapper.evalCallback_instantiate]

namespace Formed
variable {R} {Γ : List (Expr S)} {γ : Nat → Mode} {C : Set (Set S)}
    {L : LogicSetup P Γ γ C} {I J H : Set S} (h : R.Formed L I J I)
    {U : DataWrapper S true} (hU : U.Formed L I H)
include h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Channels/Variant882ffb759ffa909300bfbbaf272e345b424cfc5918c6bcd6e053ccef4079d66b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Channels/Variant882ffb759ffa909300bfbbaf272e345b424cfc5918c6bcd6e053ccef4079d66b.lean#L708).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9f27095a5042c2e106babe2ec20a6039c2922cab` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
