## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a4d59d89a38249d4de86818411c6c5fdd60b3c6c6508d3ab1b22e6bb489e2845`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 67–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def recover (L : LogicCode S) (T v Q : Expr S) :=
  L.cond (R.bit L T v) (R.eval T v Q) (L.neg (R.eval T v Q))

variable {Γ Δ : List (Expr S)} {γ δ : Nat → Mode} {C : Set (Set S)}
    (L : LogicSetup P Γ γ C) (I J K : Set S)
/-- Formation of the inner and outer odd wrappers along the specified profile vertices. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Channels/Variantd934298cfc8401330de7038d4a29f2ab66a8979fee7b8c6790b4f6d24415d9a6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Channels/Variantd934298cfc8401330de7038d4a29f2ab66a8979fee7b8c6790b4f6d24415d9a6.lean#L67).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2e08ade0998e8488cb1eaca1e8a88450ad374506` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
