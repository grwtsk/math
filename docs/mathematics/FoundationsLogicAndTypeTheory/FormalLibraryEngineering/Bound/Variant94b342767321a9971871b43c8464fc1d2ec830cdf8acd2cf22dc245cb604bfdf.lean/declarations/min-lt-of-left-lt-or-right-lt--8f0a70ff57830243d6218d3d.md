## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e85c8779-b167-d2ab-78bf-111efdd3a225`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 179–198.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma min_lt_of_left_lt_or_right_lt : a < c ∨ b < c → min a b < c := min_lt_iff.mpr

-- Register guessing rules
attribute [bound]
  -- Which side of the `max` should we use as the lower bound?
  le_max_of_le_left_or_le_right
  lt_max_of_lt_left_or_lt_right
  -- Which side of the `min` should we use as the upper bound?
  min_le_of_left_le_or_right_le
  min_lt_of_left_lt_or_right_lt

end Guessing

### Closing tactics

TODO: Kim Morrison noted that we could check for `ℕ` or `ℤ` and try `omega` as well.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Bound/Variant94b342767321a9971871b43c8464fc1d2ec830cdf8acd2cf22dc245cb604bfdf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Bound/Variant94b342767321a9971871b43c8464fc1d2ec830cdf8acd2cf22dc245cb604bfdf.lean#L179).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d93926ee517e90a51d82000f33e3dd3235561ff6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
