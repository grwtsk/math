## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ad31d58930c60672bcf25a3dbb06abc49b875b9f29149ae79de3c021b3d7aa63`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 104–115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def onHighestNode? {α} (t : InfoTree) (ctx? : Option ContextInfo)
    (f : ContextInfo → Info → PersistentArray InfoTree → α) : Option α :=
  t.findSome? (ctx? := ctx?) fun ctx i ch => some (f ctx i ch)

/--
Returns the context and `info` on the outermost `.node info _` which has
context, having merged and updated contexts appropriately.

If `ctx?` is `some ctx`, `ctx` is used as an initial context. A `ctx?` of `none` should **only** be
used when operating on the first node of the entire infotree. Otherwise, it is likely that no
context will be found.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/InfoTree/Variantee45ebeb7b967d58af1573cfceefc32da4e6cc6bf7601e4e0f6c5a027d7374df.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/InfoTree/Variantee45ebeb7b967d58af1573cfceefc32da4e6cc6bf7601e4e0f6c5a027d7374df.lean#L104).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4ed9e0797f6ee5e716ca7b9c7171b2134cbe8c34` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
