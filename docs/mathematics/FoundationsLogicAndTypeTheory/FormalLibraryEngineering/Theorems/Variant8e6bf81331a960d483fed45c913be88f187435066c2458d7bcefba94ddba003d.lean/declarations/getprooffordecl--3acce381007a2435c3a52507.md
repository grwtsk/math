## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fe180ba46a716192977a44ac7fd9ba5d1f77d9d5343266671065c295be948c68`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 177–190.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getProofForDecl (declName : Name) : MetaM Expr := do
  let info ← getConstVal declName
  -- For theorems, `isProp` has already been checked at declaration time
  unless wasOriginallyTheorem (← getEnv) declName do
    unless (← isProp info.type) do
      throwError "invalid `grind` theorem `{.ofConstName declName}`, type is not a proposition"
  let us := info.levelParams.map mkLevelParam
  return mkConst declName us

/--
A `TheoremsArray α` is a collection of `Theorems α`.
The array is scanned linear during theorem activation.
This avoids the need for efficiently merging the `Theorems α` data structure.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Theorems/Variant8e6bf81331a960d483fed45c913be88f187435066c2458d7bcefba94ddba003d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Theorems/Variant8e6bf81331a960d483fed45c913be88f187435066c2458d7bcefba94ddba003d.lean#L177).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0ba54a26c0176afaf6b32471415df3fad21be889` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
