## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:db1eaf88c28cbc849fd30231e3ff4c44bb9361bd5953c12c977c206ef44d53f7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 274–315.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


/-- There are four types of theorems:
- lam - theorem about basic lambda calculus terms
- function - theorem about a specific function(declared or free variable) in specific arguments
- mor - special theorems talking about bundled morphisms/DFunLike.coe
- transition - theorems inferring one function property from another

Examples:
- lam
```
  theorem Continuous_id : Continuous fun x => x
  theorem Continuous_comp (hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g) : Continuous fun x => f (g x)
```
- function
```
  theorem Continuous_add : Continuous (fun x => x.1 + x.2)
  theorem Continuous_add (hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g) :
      Continuous (fun x => (f x) + (g x))
```
- mor - the head of function body has to be ``DFunLike.code
```
  theorem ContDiff.clm_apply {f : E → F →L[𝕜] G} {g : E → F}
      (hf : ContDiff 𝕜 n f) (hg : ContDiff 𝕜 n g) :
      ContDiff 𝕜 n fun x => (f x) (g x)
  theorem clm_linear {f : E →L[𝕜] F} : IsLinearMap 𝕜 f
```
- transition - the conclusion has to be in the form `P f` where `f` is a free variable
```
  theorem linear_is_continuous [FiniteDimensional ℝ E] {f : E → F} (hf : IsLinearMap 𝕜 f) :
      Continuous f
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Theorems/Variantca69a6fe15ae48606ae6cf1a2cdad0024119bbc7535f0fcda21b6e83d34de318.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Theorems/Variantca69a6fe15ae48606ae6cf1a2cdad0024119bbc7535f0fcda21b6e83d34de318.lean#L274).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `56cffd3792e30421701d4b663453b1635aa2e5d6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
