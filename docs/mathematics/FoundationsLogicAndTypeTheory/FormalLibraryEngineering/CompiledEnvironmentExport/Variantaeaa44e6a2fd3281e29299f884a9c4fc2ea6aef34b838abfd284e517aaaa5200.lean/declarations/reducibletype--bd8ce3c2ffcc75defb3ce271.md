## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3f5ef3fc4b91fbd311eb5c26452daf14a6737fdaf9a7a5cb8265bc3851946cda`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–139.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def reducibleType (env : Environment) (info : ConstantInfo) : IO String := do
  let coreContext : Core.Context :=
    { fileName := "<compiled-environment-export>"
      fileMap := default
      options := normalizationOptions
      maxHeartbeats := 0 }
  let coreState : Core.State := { env := env }
  let action : MetaM Expr :=
    Meta.withTransparency .reducible <| reducibleWhnfTree info.type
  let (normalized, _, _) ← Meta.MetaM.toIO action coreContext coreState
  let format ← PrettyPrinter.ppExprLegacy env {} {} normalizationOptions normalized
  return format.pretty

Sort and deduplicate serialized names by their JSON string representation.

`Name.lt` is an internal structural order and is not necessarily the same as
the lexicographic order consumed by downstream JSON validators.  Applying the
serialization boundary first makes the evidence contract explicit and stable.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CompiledEnvironmentExport/Variantaeaa44e6a2fd3281e29299f884a9c4fc2ea6aef34b838abfd284e517aaaa5200.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CompiledEnvironmentExport/Variantaeaa44e6a2fd3281e29299f884a9c4fc2ea6aef34b838abfd284e517aaaa5200.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a7de1db34bf517078d5257480c79778fd4e4766` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
