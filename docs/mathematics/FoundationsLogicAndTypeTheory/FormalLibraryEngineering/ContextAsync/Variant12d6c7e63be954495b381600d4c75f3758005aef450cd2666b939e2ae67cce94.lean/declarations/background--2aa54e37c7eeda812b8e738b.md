## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0e29b90567a3ea9d2bdf8dedfd05d10de00effafe5e6f9c5c1f756713c597491`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–167.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def background (action : ContextAsync α) (prio := Task.Priority.default) : ContextAsync Unit := do
  let ctx ← getContext
  let childCtx ← ctx.fork
  Async.background (action childCtx *> childCtx.cancel .cancel) prio

/--
Launches a `ContextAsync` computation in the background, discarding its result. It's similar to `background`,
but the child context is not automatically cancelled when the action completes. This allows the disowned
computation to continue running independently, even if the parent context is cancelled. The child context
will remain alive as long as the computation needs it. See also `background` for launching tasks that are
cancelled when the parent finishes.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ContextAsync/Variant12d6c7e63be954495b381600d4c75f3758005aef450cd2666b939e2ae67cce94.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ContextAsync/Variant12d6c7e63be954495b381600d4c75f3758005aef450cd2666b939e2ae67cce94.lean#L155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7c528e64387c29337fdb204a0909960095b6a0d3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
