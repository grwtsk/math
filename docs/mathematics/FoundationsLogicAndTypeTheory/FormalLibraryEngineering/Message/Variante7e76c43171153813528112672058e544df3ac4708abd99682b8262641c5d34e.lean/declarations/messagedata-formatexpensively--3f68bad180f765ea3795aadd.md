## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0ad78ff35d70cc708ed62c9f11a8acb9ec08b77ba9855ec0078e08b1d8ee76c2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 758–773.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def MessageData.formatExpensively (ctx : PPContext) (msg : MessageData) : BaseIO String := do
  let { env, mctx, lctx, opts, currNamespace, openDecls } := ctx
  -- Simulate the naming context that will be added to the actual message
  let msg := MessageData.withNamingContext { currNamespace, openDecls } msg
  let fmt ← msg.format (some { env, mctx, lctx, opts })
  return fmt.pretty


/--
Renders an expression `e` inline in a message unless it will exceed `maxInlineLength` characters, in
which case the expression is indented on a new line.

Note that the output of this function is formatted with preceding and trailing space included. Thus,
in `m₁ ++ inlineExpr e ++ m₂`, `m₁` should not end with a space or new line, nor should `m₂` begin
with one.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Message/Variante7e76c43171153813528112672058e544df3ac4708abd99682b8262641c5d34e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Message/Variante7e76c43171153813528112672058e544df3ac4708abd99682b8262641c5d34e.lean#L758).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `54f58ea856f670e5ecf3e6a12e85d85bf379ce83` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
