## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c7c60a6a9208e0cc2d9510f486ef95d3aaf3ed6ec3fcb196ee98e4081592c8bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 101–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure TraceData where
  /-- Trace class, e.g. `Elab.step`. -/
  cls       : Name
  /-- Structured success/failure result set by `withTraceNode`/`withTraceNodeBefore`.
  `none` for trace nodes not created by these functions (e.g. `addTrace`, diagnostic nodes). -/
  result?   : Option TraceResult := none
  /-- Start time in seconds; 0 if unknown to avoid `Option` allocation. -/
  startTime : Float := 0
  /-- Stop time in seconds; 0 if unknown to avoid `Option` allocation. -/
  stopTime  : Float := startTime
  /-- Whether trace node defaults to collapsed in the infoview. -/
  collapsed : Bool := true
  /-- Optional tag shown in `trace.profiler.output` output after the trace class name. -/
  tag       : String := ""

/-- Structured message data. We use it for reporting errors, trace messages, etc. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Message/Variante7e76c43171153813528112672058e544df3ac4708abd99682b8262641c5d34e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Message/Variante7e76c43171153813528112672058e544df3ac4708abd99682b8262641c5d34e.lean#L101).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `54f58ea856f670e5ecf3e6a12e85d85bf379ce83` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
