## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7045973451f0cde486cf54b3e27a5d6c243e0b07d5d8cfb6c1c2ce23e7b5c648`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 308–328.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def withExprHover (fmt : Format) (expr : Expr) (lctx : LocalContext)
    (location? : Option DeclarationLocation := none)
    (docString? : Option String := none)
    (mkDocString? : Option (PPContext → IO String) := none)
    (explicit : Bool := false) : MessageData :=
  .ofFormatWithInfos {
      fmt := .tag 0 fmt
      infos :=
        .ofList [(0, Elab.Info.ofDelabTermInfo {
          expr, lctx, location?, explicit,
          stx := .missing, -- unused for delaborator hovers
          expectedType? := none, -- unused for delaborator hovers
          elaborator := `Delab.withExprHover,
          mkDocString? := mkDocString? <|> docString?.map (fun _ => pure ·)
        })]
  }

/--
Calls `withExprHover`, but uses the current local context if one is not given.
See `withExprHover` for a description of each parameter.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Message/Variant09277320b843288e7a51b98c794e4440cfd0e3c71e18eb777105414751a1004f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Message/Variant09277320b843288e7a51b98c794e4440cfd0e3c71e18eb777105414751a1004f.lean#L308).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5e2281389fe25ed6d76c50e2d78bed7a16b3ab36` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
