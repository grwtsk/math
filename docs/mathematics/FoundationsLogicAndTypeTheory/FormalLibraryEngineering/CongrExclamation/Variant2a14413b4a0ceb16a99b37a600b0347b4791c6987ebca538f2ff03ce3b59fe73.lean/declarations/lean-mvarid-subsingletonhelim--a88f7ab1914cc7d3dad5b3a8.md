## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cf3d633f337f2997306ed12b89e863c3110f31a7483a32870d62b572ea34511e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 522–542.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Lean.MVarId.subsingletonHelim? (mvarId : MVarId) : MetaM (Option (List MVarId)) :=
  mvarId.withContext <| observing? do
    mvarId.checkNotAssigned `subsingletonHelim
    let some (α, lhs, β, rhs) := (← withReducible mvarId.getType').heq? | failure
    withSubsingletonAsFast fun elim => do
      let eqmvar ← mkFreshExprSyntheticOpaqueMVar (← mkEq α β) (← mvarId.getTag)
      -- First try synthesizing using the left-hand side for the Subsingleton instance
      if let some pf ← observing? (mkAppM ``FastSubsingleton.helim #[eqmvar, lhs, rhs]) then
        mvarId.assign <| elim pf
        return [eqmvar.mvarId!]
      let eqsymm ← mkAppM ``Eq.symm #[eqmvar]
      -- Second try synthesizing using the right-hand side for the Subsingleton instance
      if let some pf ← observing? (mkAppM ``FastSubsingleton.helim #[eqsymm, rhs, lhs]) then
        mvarId.assign <| elim (← mkAppM ``HEq.symm #[pf])
        return [eqmvar.mvarId!]
      failure

Tries to apply `lawful_beq_subsingleton` to prove that two `BEq` instances are equal
by synthesizing `LawfulBEq` instances for both.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CongrExclamation/Variant2a14413b4a0ceb16a99b37a600b0347b4791c6987ebca538f2ff03ce3b59fe73.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CongrExclamation/Variant2a14413b4a0ceb16a99b37a600b0347b4791c6987ebca538f2ff03ce3b59fe73.lean#L522).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bec234e045917543be9f273d1029e9a940519432` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
