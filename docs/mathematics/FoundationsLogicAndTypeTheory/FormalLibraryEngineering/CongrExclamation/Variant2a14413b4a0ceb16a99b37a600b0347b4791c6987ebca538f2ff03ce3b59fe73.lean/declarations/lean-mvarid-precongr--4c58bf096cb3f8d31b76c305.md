## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6cf2e509afab56667ea407a587d33f4b5ea9d11901b0293db52c3a6a16d6f144`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 657–673.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Lean.MVarId.preCongr! (mvarId : MVarId) (tryClose : Bool) : MetaM (Option MVarId) := do
  -- Next, turn `HEq` and `Iff` into `Eq`
  let mvarId ← mvarId.heqOfEq
  if tryClose then
    -- This is a good time to check whether we have a relevant hypothesis.
    if ← mvarId.assumptionCore then return none
  let mvarId ← mvarId.iffOfEq
  if tryClose then
    -- Now try definitional equality. No need to try `mvarId.hrefl` since we already did `heqOfEq`.
    -- We allow synthetic opaque metavariables to be assigned to fill in `x = _` goals that might
    -- appear (for example, due to using `convert` with placeholders).
    try withAssignableSyntheticOpaque mvarId.refl; return none catch _ => pure ()
    -- Now we go for (heterogeneous) equality via subsingleton considerations
    if ← Lean.Meta.fastSubsingletonElim mvarId then return none
    if ← mvarId.proofIrrelHeq then return none
  return some mvarId

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CongrExclamation/Variant2a14413b4a0ceb16a99b37a600b0347b4791c6987ebca538f2ff03ce3b59fe73.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CongrExclamation/Variant2a14413b4a0ceb16a99b37a600b0347b4791c6987ebca538f2ff03ce3b59fe73.lean#L657).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bec234e045917543be9f273d1029e9a940519432` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
