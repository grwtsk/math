## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:68ebdeec9d43236d1352c09970718c162e89bf1fe083e64168c39422f1a72878`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 215–223.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkToExprInstanceCmds (declNames : Array Name) : TermElabM (Array Syntax) := do
  let ctx ← mkContext ``ToExpr "toExpr" declNames[0]!
  let cmds := #[← mkAuxFunctions ctx] ++ (← mkInstanceCmds ctx declNames)
  trace[Elab.Deriving.toExpr] "\n{cmds}"
  return cmds

/--
The main entry point to the `ToExpr` deriving handler.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ToExpr/Variantc3bc6d235b5a47b7563168e82b70842dfe8d1521da10ef0c3650f2643922c2df.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ToExpr/Variantc3bc6d235b5a47b7563168e82b70842dfe8d1521da10ef0c3650f2643922c2df.lean#L215).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0d73d5cc2ef8bf693ed8883a0f765bef7c10b609` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
