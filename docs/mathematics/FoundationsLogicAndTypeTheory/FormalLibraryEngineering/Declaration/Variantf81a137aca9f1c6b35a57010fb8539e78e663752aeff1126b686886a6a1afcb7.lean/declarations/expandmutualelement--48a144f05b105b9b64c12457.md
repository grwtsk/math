## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:892dc4a01d1073025f15bf2effd7443c53855e54ad97967ef4d9b6c2d54e7906`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 258–278.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def expandMutualElement : Macro := fun stx => do
  let mut elemsNew := #[]
  let mut modified := false
  for elem in stx[1].getArgs do
    -- Don't trigger the `expandNamespacedDecl` macro, the namespace is handled by the mutual def
    -- elaborator directly instead
    if !elem.isOfKind ``Parser.Command.declaration then
      if let some elemNew ← expandMacro? elem then
        if elemNew.isOfKind nullKind then
          elemsNew := elemsNew ++ elemNew.getArgs
        else
          elemsNew := elemsNew.push elemNew
        modified := true
        continue
    elemsNew := elemsNew.push elem
  if modified then
    return stx.setArg 1 (mkNullNode elemsNew)
  else
    Macro.throwUnsupported

@[builtin_macro Lean.Parser.Command.mutual]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Declaration/Variantf81a137aca9f1c6b35a57010fb8539e78e663752aeff1126b686886a6a1afcb7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Declaration/Variantf81a137aca9f1c6b35a57010fb8539e78e663752aeff1126b686886a6a1afcb7.lean#L258).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ca409f8835376638b29feca5dfa1e4a8d73cf0f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
