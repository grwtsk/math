## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b8b3e5edb21e330a6f3ce79b2d81d4cb7915acc562df5ef5657b77a4dfa3304a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 237–316.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/--
Dispatches a pending request head to the handler if one is waiting.
Spawns the handler as an async task and routes its result back through `state.response`.
Returns the updated state with `pendingHead` cleared and `handlerDispatched` set.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Connection/Variant4ad34669f1d047ed4e4059ac85db7106c78c65903abd28d7d63d5c0adb4de7d3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Connection/Variant4ad34669f1d047ed4e4059ac85db7106c78c65903abd28d7d63d5c0adb4de7d3.lean#L237).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
