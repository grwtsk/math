## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ecac664e8223866ce62c328ad909e2032504e861739f8055ef16041f787f8fc1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 102–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[expose] def EventuallyDeliversLatest
    {Host EdgeId : Type*}
    [Fintype Host] [DecidableEq Host]
    [Fintype EdgeId] [DecidableEq EdgeId]
    (contract : RoutingContract Host EdgeId) (start : Host)
    (execution : Execution Host)
    (latest : RevisionedXYZ xyzFormatV1)
    (admittedAt quiescenceTime : Nat) : Prop :=
  ∀ host, contract.Reachable start host →
    ∃ n, admittedAt ≤ n ∧ quiescenceTime ≤ n ∧
      execution.eventAt n = some ⟨host, latest⟩

/-- After `quiescenceTime`, no delivered admitted value is strictly newer
than `latest`.  The separate admission hypothesis prevents an unclassified
delivery from bypassing this condition. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Convergence/Variant416520a9d526936840fe2f831e4a236afdb98b1c69f517217e250f62b0349320.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Convergence/Variant416520a9d526936840fe2f831e4a236afdb98b1c69f517217e250f62b0349320.lean#L102).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4dd37a070b570a031eac069e50dc13c83c091e85` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
