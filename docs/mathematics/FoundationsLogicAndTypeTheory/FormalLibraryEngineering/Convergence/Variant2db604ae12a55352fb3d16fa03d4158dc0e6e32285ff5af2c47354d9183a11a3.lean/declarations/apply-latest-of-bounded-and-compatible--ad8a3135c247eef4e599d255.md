## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:df45a956-8776-156a-9ebf-f4cd36eae7d0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 258–285.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem apply_latest_of_bounded_and_compatible
    (register : LwwRegister xyzFormatV1)
    (latest : RevisionedXYZ xyzFormatV1)
    (bounded : RevisionBounded latest register)
    (equalRevisionCompatible : ∀ current,
      register.current = some current →
      latest.revision = current.revision →
      latest.value = current.value) :
    (LwwRegister.apply register latest).current = some latest := by

            bounded current rfl
          have notStale : ¬ latest.revision < current.revision :=
            not_lt_of_ge currentBound
          by_cases sameRevision : latest.revision = current.revision
          · have sameValue : latest.value = current.value :=
              equalRevisionCompatible current rfl sameRevision
            have same : latest = current :=
              revisionedXYZ_eq sameRevision sameValue
            subst current
            simp [LwwRegister.apply, merge, MergeDecision.result]
          · simp [LwwRegister.apply, merge, notStale, sameRevision,
              MergeDecision.result]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Convergence/Variant2db604ae12a55352fb3d16fa03d4158dc0e6e32285ff5af2c47354d9183a11a3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Convergence/Variant2db604ae12a55352fb3d16fa03d4158dc0e6e32285ff5af2c47354d9183a11a3.lean#L258).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3370939f57139c2b0befe390f41af8a565f301c6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
