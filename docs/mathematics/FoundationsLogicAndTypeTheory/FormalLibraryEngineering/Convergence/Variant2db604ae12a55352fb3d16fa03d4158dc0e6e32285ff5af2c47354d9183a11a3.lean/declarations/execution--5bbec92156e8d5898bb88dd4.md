## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fde96bd36ea24626569d546d2431f1b0f0982a5403bd2ecda741fc44f99431a9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 56–68.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Execution (Host : Type*) [DecidableEq Host] where
  initial : GlobalRegisters Host
  eventAt : Nat → Option (DeliveryEvent Host)
  stateAt : Nat → GlobalRegisters Host
  stateZero : stateAt 0 = initial
  stateSucc : ∀ n, stateAt (n + 1) = applyEvent (stateAt n) (eventAt n)

/-! ## The unique latest admitted value -/

/-- `latest` occurs in the admitted finite list, bounds every admitted
revision, is the only admitted value at that maximal revision, and the entire
admitted list contains no equal-revision payload conflict (including below the
maximum). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Convergence/Variant2db604ae12a55352fb3d16fa03d4158dc0e6e32285ff5af2c47354d9183a11a3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Convergence/Variant2db604ae12a55352fb3d16fa03d4158dc0e6e32285ff5af2c47354d9183a11a3.lean#L56).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3370939f57139c2b0befe390f41af8a565f301c6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
