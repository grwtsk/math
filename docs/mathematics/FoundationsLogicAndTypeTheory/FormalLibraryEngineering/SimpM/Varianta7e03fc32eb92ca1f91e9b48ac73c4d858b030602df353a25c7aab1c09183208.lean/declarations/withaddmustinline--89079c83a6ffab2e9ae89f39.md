## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:890b4e0ddc743cf7e46037b69744d2afc318872db292be4fd96881a647b9b268`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 176–187.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def withAddMustInline (fvarId : FVarId) (x : SimpM α) : SimpM α := do
  let saved? := (← get).funDeclInfoMap.map[fvarId]?
  try
    addMustInline fvarId
    x
  finally
    modify fun s => { s with funDeclInfoMap := s.funDeclInfoMap.restore fvarId saved? }

/--
Return true if the given local function declaration or join point id is marked as
`once` or `mustInline`. We use this information to decide whether to inline them.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimpM/Varianta7e03fc32eb92ca1f91e9b48ac73c4d858b030602df353a25c7aab1c09183208.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimpM/Varianta7e03fc32eb92ca1f91e9b48ac73c4d858b030602df353a25c7aab1c09183208.lean#L176).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `83844781faf121c82e311269ae9e7550907e9db5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
