## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4cbc834f70b55ed86fb1ecf973ca573316043dd2ca2bf9e7ad1a3833c0e9da95`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 328–367.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
private partial def getFunBinderIds? (stx : Syntax) : OptionT MacroM (Array Syntax) :=
  let convertElem (stx : Term) : OptionT MacroM Syntax :=
    match stx with
    | `(_) =>
      /-
      We used to use `mkFreshIdent` here,
      but it prevented us from obtaining hover info for `_` because the
      fresh identifier would have a synthetic position, and synthetic positions
      are ignored by the LSP server.
      See comment at `BinderView.ref` for additional details.
      -/
      return stx
    | `($_:ident) => return stx
    | _ => failure
  match stx with
  | `($f $args*) => do
     let mut acc := #[].push (← convertElem f)
     for arg in args do
       acc := acc.push (← convertElem arg)
     return acc
  | _ =>
    return #[].push (← convertElem stx)

/--
  Auxiliary function for expanding `fun` notation binders. Recall that `fun` parser is defined as
  ```
  def funBinder : Parser := implicitBinder <|> instBinder <|> termParser maxPrec
  leading_parser unicodeSymbol "λ" "fun" >> many1 funBinder >> "=>" >> termParser
  ```
  to allow notation such as `fun (a, b) => a + b`, where `(a, b)` should be treated as a pattern.
  The result is a pair `(explicitBinders, newBody)`, where `explicitBinders` is syntax of the form
  ```
  `(` ident `:` term `)`
  ```
  which can be elaborated using `elabBinders`, and `newBody` is the updated `body` syntax.
  We update the `body` syntax when expanding the pattern notation.
  Example: `fun (a, b) => a + b` expands into `fun _a_1 => match _a_1 with | (a, b) => a + b`.
  See local function `processAsPattern` at `expandFunBindersAux`.

  The resulting `Bool` is true if a pattern was found. We use it "mark" a macro expansion. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Binders/Variantbdc2daa964d3a3aad89291ba8d545684e0e3539f472557f1582a4dbe8125e860.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Binders/Variantbdc2daa964d3a3aad89291ba8d545684e0e3539f472557f1582a4dbe8125e860.lean#L328).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f231e0603e9ee2639fdca4b396b06e20111c1cf8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
