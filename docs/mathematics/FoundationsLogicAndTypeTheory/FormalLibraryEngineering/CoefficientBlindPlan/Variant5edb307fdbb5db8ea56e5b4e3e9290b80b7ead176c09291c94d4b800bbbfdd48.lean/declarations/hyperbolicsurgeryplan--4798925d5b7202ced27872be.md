## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ccc244ba650e68a05fe8fb885223d6dada7ba9e6bde722c97777a1df62c38733`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 81–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure HyperbolicSurgeryPlan
    (N q : ℕ) (B : TypeIIShellFactorBlock N q) where
  packetGeometry : CoefficientFreeBlockPacketGeometry B
  spatialCarrier : TypeIISpatialCarrier3 packetGeometry.PacketAtom
  tree : CoefficientFreeSurgeryTree B
  intervalKernel : tree.Node → TypeIIProductDyadicInterval N q →
    Matrix B.Left B.Right ℂ
  root_intervalKernel : ∀ interval,
    intervalKernel tree.root interval =
      typeIIShellIntervalMatrix B interval
  structuredLeftDepth : ℕ
  structuredRightDepth : ℕ

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CoefficientBlindPlan/Variant5edb307fdbb5db8ea56e5b4e3e9290b80b7ead176c09291c94d4b800bbbfdd48.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CoefficientBlindPlan/Variant5edb307fdbb5db8ea56e5b4e3e9290b80b7ead176c09291c94d4b800bbbfdd48.lean#L81).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `78fead674d1e0441bcd78dfb38fd25d9b18a06f6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
