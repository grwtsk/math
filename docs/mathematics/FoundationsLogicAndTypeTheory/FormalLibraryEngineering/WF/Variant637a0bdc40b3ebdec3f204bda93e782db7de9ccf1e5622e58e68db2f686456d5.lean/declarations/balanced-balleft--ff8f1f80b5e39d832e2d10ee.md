## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4b5aff14-9889-a6e3-86d7-e523caf311c4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 326–341.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem Balanced.balLeft (hl : l.RedRed True n) (hr : r.Balanced cr (n + 1)) :
    (balLeft l v r).RedRed (cr = red) (n + 1) := by
  unfold balLeft; split
  · next a x b => exact
    let ⟨ca, cb, ha, hb⟩ := hl.of_red
    match cr with
    | red => .redred rfl (.black ha hb) hr
    | black => .balanced (.red (.black ha hb) hr)
  · next H => exact match hl with
    | .redred .. => nomatch H _ _ _ rfl
    | .balanced hl => match hr with
      | .black ha hb =>
        let ⟨c, h⟩ := RedRed.balance2 hl (.redred trivial ha hb); .balanced h
      | .red (.black ha hb) (.black hc hd) =>
        let ⟨c, h⟩ := RedRed.balance2 hb (.redred trivial hc hd); .redred rfl (.black hl ha) h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/WF/Variant637a0bdc40b3ebdec3f204bda93e782db7de9ccf1e5622e58e68db2f686456d5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/WF/Variant637a0bdc40b3ebdec3f204bda93e782db7de9ccf1e5622e58e68db2f686456d5.lean#L326).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2f36e1e7e2dd9e92d4eebfbb1d1b1530bceb5426` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
