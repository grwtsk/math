## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c1e26c0e-fad7-1804-9208-a5e5ea936003`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 217–228.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem RedRed.balance1 {l : RBNode α} {v : α} {r : RBNode α}
    (hl : l.RedRed p n) (hr : r.Balanced c n) : ∃ c, (balance1 l v r).Balanced c (n + 1) := by
  unfold balance1; split
  · have .redred _ (.red ha hb) hc := hl; exact ⟨_, .red (.black ha hb) (.black hc hr)⟩
  · have .redred _ ha (.red hb hc) := hl; exact ⟨_, .red (.black ha hb) (.black hc hr)⟩
  · next H1 H2 => match hl with
    | .balanced hl => exact ⟨_, .black hl hr⟩
    | .redred _ (c₁ := black) (c₂ := black) ha hb => exact ⟨_, .black (.red ha hb) hr⟩
    | .redred _ (c₁ := red) (.red ..) _ => cases H1 _ _ _ _ _ rfl
    | .redred _ (c₂ := red) _ (.red ..) => cases H2 _ _ _ _ _ rfl

/-- The `balance2` function repairs the balance invariant when the second argument is red-red. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/WF/Variant637a0bdc40b3ebdec3f204bda93e782db7de9ccf1e5622e58e68db2f686456d5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/WF/Variant637a0bdc40b3ebdec3f204bda93e782db7de9ccf1e5622e58e68db2f686456d5.lean#L217).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2f36e1e7e2dd9e92d4eebfbb1d1b1530bceb5426` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
