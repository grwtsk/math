## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4806ec876f8b28a9c5339d818428a1fe72df2abfccae973a54cbc3adc0c1bc5a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 40–70.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def rwFixEq (mvarId : MVarId) : MetaM MVarId := mvarId.withContext do
  let target ← mvarId.getType'
  let some (_, lhs, rhs) := target.eq? | unreachable!

  -- lhs should be an application of the declNameNonrec, which unfolds to an
  -- application of fix in one step
  let some lhs' ← delta? lhs | throwError "rwFixEq: cannot delta-reduce {lhs}"
  let h ← match_expr lhs' with
    | WellFounded.fix _α _C _r _hwf _F _x =>
      pure <| mkAppN (mkConst ``WellFounded.fix_eq lhs'.getAppFn.constLevels!) lhs'.getAppArgs
    | WellFounded.Nat.fix _α _C _motive _F _x =>
      pure <| mkAppN (mkConst ``WellFounded.Nat.fix_eq lhs'.getAppFn.constLevels!) lhs'.getAppArgs
    | _ => throwTacticEx `rwFixEq mvarId m!"expected saturated fixed-point application in {lhs'}"
  let F := lhs'.appFn!.appArg!
  let x := lhs'.appArg!

  -- We used to just rewrite with `fix_eq` and continue with whatever RHS that produces, but that
  -- would include more copies of `fix` resulting in large and confusing terms.
  -- Instead we manually construct the new term in terms of the current functions,
  -- which should be headed by the `declNameNonRec`, and should be defeq to the expected type

  -- if lhs == e x and lhs' == fix .., then lhsNew := e x = F x (fun y _ => e y)
  let ftype := (← inferType (mkApp F x)).bindingDomain!
  let f' ← forallBoundedTelescope ftype (some 2) fun ys _ => do
    mkLambdaFVars ys (.app lhs.appFn! ys[0]!)
  let lhsNew := mkApp2 F x f'
  let targetNew ← mkEq lhsNew rhs
  let mvarNew ← mkFreshExprSyntheticOpaqueMVar targetNew
  mvarId.assign (← mkEqTrans h mvarNew)
  return mvarNew.mvarId!

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Unfold/Variantc652951b8280bbba9c5840c7df1fe95a9d5e476e69cc45727d44c22efd1d2e8f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Unfold/Variantc652951b8280bbba9c5840c7df1fe95a9d5e476e69cc45727d44c22efd1d2e8f.lean#L40).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `849a457353df87c49693cff34437d1c9ba571f06` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
