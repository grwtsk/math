## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f38c87c2b4971a4dd2243aed0a08f7852ef6c92dc93708a8cdb1fb2ab37625cf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 254–280.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public def mkBinaryUnfoldEq (preDef : PreDefinition) (unaryPreDefName : Name) : MetaM Unit := do
  let name := mkEqLikeNameFor (← getEnv) preDef.declName unfoldThmSuffix
  let unaryEqName:= mkEqLikeNameFor (← getEnv) unaryPreDefName unfoldThmSuffix
  prependError m!"Cannot derive {name} from {unaryEqName}" do
  withOptions (tactic.hygienic.set · false) do
    lambdaTelescope preDef.value fun xs body => do
      let us := preDef.levelParams.map mkLevelParam
      let lhs := mkAppN (Lean.mkConst preDef.declName us) xs
      let type ← mkEq lhs body
      let main ← mkFreshExprSyntheticOpaqueMVar type
      let mvarId := main.mvarId!
      let mvarId ← deltaLHS mvarId -- unfold the function
      let mvarIds ← mvarId.applyConst unaryEqName
      unless mvarIds.isEmpty do
        throwError "Failed to apply `{unaryEqName}` to `{mvarId}`"

      let value ← instantiateMVars main
      let type ← mkForallFVars xs type
      let type ← letToHave type
      let value ← mkLambdaFVars xs value
      addDecl <| Declaration.thmDecl {
        name, type, value
        levelParams := preDef.levelParams
      }
      inferDefEqAttr name
      trace[Elab.definition.wf] "mkBinaryUnfoldEq defined {.ofConstName name}"

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Unfold/Variantc652951b8280bbba9c5840c7df1fe95a9d5e476e69cc45727d44c22efd1d2e8f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Unfold/Variantc652951b8280bbba9c5840c7df1fe95a9d5e476e69cc45727d44c22efd1d2e8f.lean#L254).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `849a457353df87c49693cff34437d1c9ba571f06` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
