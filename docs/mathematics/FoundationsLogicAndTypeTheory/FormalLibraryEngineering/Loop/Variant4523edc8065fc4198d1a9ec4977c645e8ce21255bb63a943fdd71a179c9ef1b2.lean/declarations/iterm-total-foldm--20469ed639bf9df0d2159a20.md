## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a01495094c28a0e07118b81be07fb504a2dc8df3e7fd4f4cdf090a2b66ffc81d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 325–336.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IterM.Total.foldM {m : Type w → Type w'} {n : Type w → Type w'} [Monad n]
    {α : Type w} {β : Type w} {γ : Type w} [Iterator α m β] [IteratorLoop α m n] [MonadLiftT m n]
    [Finite α m] (f : γ → β → n γ) (init : γ) (it : IterM.Total (α := α) m β) : n γ :=
  it.it.foldM (init := init) f

/--
Folds a function over an iterator from the left, accumulating a value starting with `init`.
The accumulated value is combined with the each element of the list in order, using `f`.

It is equivalent to `it.toList.foldl`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Loop/Variant4523edc8065fc4198d1a9ec4977c645e8ce21255bb63a943fdd71a179c9ef1b2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Loop/Variant4523edc8065fc4198d1a9ec4977c645e8ce21255bb63a943fdd71a179c9ef1b2.lean#L325).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `da790ebc593fce905c4c803667114a01385478a4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
