## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6aba603b83d598ef60edc89e4dcbf2a2235fb7e22c3e09b2e8e32e067639e23e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 930–949.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IterM.first? {α β : Type w} {m : Type w → Type w'} [Monad m] [Iterator α m β]
    [IteratorLoop α m m] (it : IterM (α := α) m β) : m (Option β) :=
  IteratorLoop.forIn (fun _ _ => flip Bind.bind) _ (fun b _ s => s = ForInStep.done (some b)) it
    none (fun b _ _ => pure ⟨ForInStep.done (some b), rfl⟩)

/--
Returns the first output of the iterator, or `none` if no such output is found.

`O(|it|)` since the iterator may skip an unknown number of times before returning a result.
Short-circuits upon encountering the first result. The elements in `it` are examined in order of
iteration.

This variant terminates after finitely many steps and requires a proof that the iterator is
productive. If such a proof is not available, consider using `IterM.first?`.

Examples:
* `([7, 6].iterM Id).first? = pure (some 7)`
* `([].iterM Id).first? = pure none`

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Loop/Variant4523edc8065fc4198d1a9ec4977c645e8ce21255bb63a943fdd71a179c9ef1b2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Loop/Variant4523edc8065fc4198d1a9ec4977c645e8ce21255bb63a943fdd71a179c9ef1b2.lean#L930).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `da790ebc593fce905c4c803667114a01385478a4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
