## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bc0c84f12aff7a87d4b80a1a54828609966484e2b226a8ca7e9525ee06be6858`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 723–741.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IterM.findSome? {α β γ : Type w} {m : Type w → Type w'} [Monad m] [Iterator α m β]
    [IteratorLoop α m m] (it : IterM (α := α) m β) (f : β → Option γ) :
    m (Option γ) :=
  it.findSomeM? (pure <| f ·)

/--
Returns the first non-`none` result of applying `f` to each output of the iterator, in order.
Returns `none` if `f` returns `none` for all outputs.

`O(|it|)`. Short-circuits when `f` returns `some _`.The outputs of `it` are examined in order of
iteration.

This function is deprecated. Instead of `it.allowNontermination.findSome?`, use `it.findSome?`.

Examples:
 * `([7, 6, 5, 8, 1, 2, 6].iterM Id).allowNontermination.findSome? (fun x => if x < 5 then some (10 * x) else none) = pure (some 10)`
 * `([7, 6, 5, 8, 1, 2, 6].iterM Id).allowNontermination.findSome? (fun x => if x < 1 then some (10 * x) else none) = pure none`

@[inline, deprecated IterM.findSome? (since := "2025-12-04")]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Loop/Varianta0a433df087cf4b914ba4a8a6e99ff1de25a16bbcd0c45090c964b50288f0b8a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Loop/Varianta0a433df087cf4b914ba4a8a6e99ff1de25a16bbcd0c45090c964b50288f0b8a.lean#L723).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `676e7f3761eb5ede32612fb091ed3b0b557ddc86` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
