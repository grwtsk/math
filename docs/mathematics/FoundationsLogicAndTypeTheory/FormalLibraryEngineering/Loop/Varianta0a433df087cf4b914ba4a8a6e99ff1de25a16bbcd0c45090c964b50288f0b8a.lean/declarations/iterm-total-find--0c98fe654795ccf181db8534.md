## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ac3f46a4a1d786b198efdb2d3b29fba13fdd521c97922d08eb4a2c8af43b25ab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 919–937.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IterM.Total.find? {α β : Type w} {m : Type w → Type w'} [Monad m] [Iterator α m β]
    [IteratorLoop α m m] [Finite α m] (it : IterM.Total (α := α) m β) (f : β → Bool) :
    m (Option β) :=
  it.it.find? f

/--
Returns the first output of the iterator, or `none` if no such output is found.

`O(|it|)` since the iterator may skip an unknown number of times before returning a result.
Short-circuits upon encountering the first result. Only the first element of `it` is examined.

If the iterator is not productive, this function might run forever. The variant
`it.ensureTermination.first?` always terminates after finitely many steps.

Examples:
* `([7, 6].iterM Id).first? = pure (some 7)`
* `([].iterM Id).first? = pure none`

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Loop/Varianta0a433df087cf4b914ba4a8a6e99ff1de25a16bbcd0c45090c964b50288f0b8a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Loop/Varianta0a433df087cf4b914ba4a8a6e99ff1de25a16bbcd0c45090c964b50288f0b8a.lean#L919).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `676e7f3761eb5ede32612fb091ed3b0b557ddc86` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
