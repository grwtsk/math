## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ce320fe070eaf24917bc612360652e029bc9fe0e58fb9af3ca039570b5782cdd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 147–159.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Iter.Total.foldM {m : Type x → Type x'} [Monad m]
    {α : Type w} {β : Type w} {γ : Type x} [Iterator α Id β]
    [IteratorLoop α Id m] [Finite α Id] (f : γ → β → m γ)
    (init : γ) (it : Iter.Total (α := α) β) : m γ :=
  it.it.foldM (init := init) f

/--
Folds a function over an iterator from the left, accumulating a value starting with `init`.
The accumulated value is combined with the each element of the list in order, using `f`.

It is equivalent to `it.toList.foldl`.
-/
@[always_inline, inline]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Loop/Variant87e11dbce4303ceb8c66db2c586589ec13c9f62f510c17eefbd6fec7bd265395.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Loop/Variant87e11dbce4303ceb8c66db2c586589ec13c9f62f510c17eefbd6fec7bd265395.lean#L147).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `79d052fa3c8089a7a51b105e1c5da23912fb7684` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
