## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ccc3366ce75c4631fc2f1e858d6977bdbcc62d4b56826ec5ff7b99a83fdac475`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 611–629.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Iter.Partial.find? {α β : Type w} [Iterator α Id β] [IteratorLoop α Id Id]
    (it : Iter.Partial (α := α) β) (f : β → Bool) : Option β :=
  it.it.find? f

/--
Returns the first output of the iterator for which the predicate `p` returns `true`, or `none` if
no such output is found.

`O(|it|)`. Short-circuits upon encountering the first match. The elements in `it` are examined in
order of iteration.

This variant terminates after finitely many steps and requires a proof that the iterator is
finite. If such a proof is not available, consider using `Iter.find?`.

Examples:
* `[7, 6, 5, 8, 1, 2, 6].iter.find? (· < 5) = some 1`
* `[7, 6, 5, 8, 1, 2, 6].iter.find? (· < 1) = none`

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Loop/Variant334fd8452fabf0f25f424744d381e895383a6077b45d68a45e74afa64fa7be66.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Loop/Variant334fd8452fabf0f25f424744d381e895383a6077b45d68a45e74afa64fa7be66.lean#L611).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a30156922db4f4dee12afccd137cc10d47922601` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
