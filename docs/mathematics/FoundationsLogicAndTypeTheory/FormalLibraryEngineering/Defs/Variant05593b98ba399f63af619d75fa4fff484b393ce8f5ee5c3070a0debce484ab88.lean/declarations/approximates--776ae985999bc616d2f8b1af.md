## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `coinductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:99f02db6f0b5e3180c58cb81e06b95abbdf7125b5651ae5d78e6d319b869ac58`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 819–838.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
coinductive Approximates : {basis : Basis} → (ms : MultiseriesExpansion basis) → Prop
/-- Constant multiseries always approximates its attached function. -/
| const (ms : MultiseriesExpansion []) : Approximates ms
/-- Empty multiseries approximates (eventually) zero function. -/
| nil {basis_hd : ℝ → ℝ} {basis_tl : Basis} {f : ℝ → ℝ} (hf : f =ᶠ[atTop] 0) :
  Approximates (mk (@Multiseries.nil basis_hd basis_tl) f)
/-- `cons (exp, coef) tl` approximates `f` when `coef` approximates some function `fC`, `f` is
majorized with exponent `exp` by `basis_hd`, and `tl` approximates `f - fC * basis_hd ^ exp`. -/
| cons {basis_hd f : ℝ → ℝ} {basis_tl : Basis} {exp : ℝ} {coef : MultiseriesExpansion basis_tl}
    {tl : Multiseries basis_hd basis_tl}
    (h_coef : Approximates coef) (h_maj : Majorized f basis_hd exp)
    (h_tl : Approximates (mk tl (f - basis_hd ^ exp * coef.toFun))) :
  Approximates (mk (.cons exp coef tl) f)

variable {f basis_hd : ℝ → ℝ} {basis_tl : Basis}

attribute [simp] Approximates.const

namespace Approximates

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Defs/Variant05593b98ba399f63af619d75fa4fff484b393ce8f5ee5c3070a0debce484ab88.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Defs/Variant05593b98ba399f63af619d75fa4fff484b393ce8f5ee5c3070a0debce484ab88.lean#L819).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d3ac471112fc3173c91f2833081db99a9f34b53a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
