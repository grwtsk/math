## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:31c08a0a12c0182cada361f58b60ca5fcaa82a7373fd4c651ffea6877c524280`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 197–214.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def Internal.Meta.escapePart (s : String) (force : Bool := false) : Option String :=
  if h : s.utf8ByteSize > 0 then
    if !force && needsNoEscape s h then
      some s
    else if String.Internal.any s isIdEndEscape then
      none
    else
      some <| escape s
  else
    some <| escape s

variable (sep : String) (escape : Bool) in
/--
Uses the separator `sep` (usually `"."`) to combine the components of the `Name` into a string.
See the documentation for `Name.toStringWithToken` for an explanation of `escape` and `isToken`.
-/
-- If you change this, also change the corresponding function in `Init.Data.ToString.Name`.
@[specialize isToken] -- explicit annotation because isToken is overridden in recursive call
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Defs/Variant01154a5f32560e2e971728ccb90a0cba6faa2f5c4764c9bab4bbcf7cb60b20b6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Defs/Variant01154a5f32560e2e971728ccb90a0cba6faa2f5c4764c9bab4bbcf7cb60b20b6.lean#L197).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `201680de486432949cac7a2da67f00faabd021da` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
