## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:47f4e21fc72d9fcfd982887bcb416299a52fc28a7f71f0a1e24c5c1cb2b0b8c9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1399–1410.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def HygieneInfo.mkIdent (s : HygieneInfo) (val : Name) (canonical := false) : Ident :=
  let src := s.raw[0]
  let id := { extractMacroScopes src.getId with name := val.eraseMacroScopes }.review
  ⟨Syntax.ident (SourceInfo.fromRef src canonical) (Name.Internal.Meta.toString val).toRawSubstring id []⟩

/--
Converts a runtime value into surface syntax that denotes it.

Instances do not need to guarantee that the resulting syntax will always re-elaborate into an
equivalent value. For example, the syntax may omit implicit arguments that can usually be found
automatically.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Defs/Variant788ba408c7541d2beef43b17b2575f6a5202d7db4c767954a73ba0124a6d03e3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Defs/Variant788ba408c7541d2beef43b17b2575f6a5202d7db4c767954a73ba0124a6d03e3.lean#L1399).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d1a961f4b3986e7d6580325351fffdb647ad200c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
