## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2f301bc68e2b9a091773a9bb4df5a3f1041c74176f694001225efc95da681110`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 472–481.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def InfoTree.termGoalAt? (t : InfoTree) (hoverPos : String.Pos.Raw) : Option InfoWithCtx :=
  -- In the case `f a b`, where `f` is an identifier, the term goal at `f` should be the goal for the full application `f a b`.
  let filter ctx info children results :=
    if info.stx.isOfKind ``Parser.Term.app && info.stx[0].isIdent then
      results.filter (·.2.info.stx != info.stx[0])
    else
      results
  hoverableInfoAtM? (m := Id) t hoverPos (includeStop := true) (filter := filter)

end Lean.Elab
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/InfoUtils/Variant9d73a7028d8ccdb3fd6c8060474e27970231dda643c146f8685271a7995285b2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/InfoUtils/Variant9d73a7028d8ccdb3fd6c8060474e27970231dda643c146f8685271a7995285b2.lean#L472).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fa4de68a3f0a24d08f32c53b79a2928e9b0eb7f7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
