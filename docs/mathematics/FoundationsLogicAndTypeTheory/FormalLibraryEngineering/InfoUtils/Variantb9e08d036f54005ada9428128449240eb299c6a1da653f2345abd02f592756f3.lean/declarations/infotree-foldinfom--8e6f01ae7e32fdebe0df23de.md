## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c96a731d83ab7281ee6b37a6cd4e9d9ef6b63300335a077ded6f1fec1f333c5b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 124–142.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def InfoTree.foldInfoM [Monad m] (f : ContextInfo → Info → α → m α) (init : α) : InfoTree → m α :=
  go none init
where go ctx? a
  | context ctx t => go (ctx.mergeIntoOuter? ctx?) a t
  | node i ts => do
    let a ← match ctx? with
      | none => pure a
      | some ctx => f ctx i a
    ts.foldlM (init := a) (go <| i.updateContext? ctx?)
  | hole _ => pure a

/--
Fold an info tree as follows, while ensuring that the correct `ContextInfo` is supplied at each stage:

 * Nodes are combined with the initial value `init` using `f`, and the result is then combined with the children using a left fold
 * On InfoTree holes, we just return the initial value.

This is like `InfoTree.foldInfo`, but it also passes the whole node to `f` instead of just the head.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/InfoUtils/Variantb9e08d036f54005ada9428128449240eb299c6a1da653f2345abd02f592756f3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/InfoUtils/Variantb9e08d036f54005ada9428128449240eb299c6a1da653f2345abd02f592756f3.lean#L124).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb0304c8f9114f65df16c25b2ae77ec110b6afe7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
