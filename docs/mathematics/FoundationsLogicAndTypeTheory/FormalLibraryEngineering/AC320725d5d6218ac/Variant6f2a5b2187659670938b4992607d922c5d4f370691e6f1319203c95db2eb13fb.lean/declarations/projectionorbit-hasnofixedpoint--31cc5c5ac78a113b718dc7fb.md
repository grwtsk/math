## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7dc92141-ff09-dd03-6c7f-34d5a11f6a69`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 31–60.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem projectionOrbit_hasNoFixedPoint
    (base : MonoHierarchy hierarchy.Element)
    (nontrivial :
      ∃ moved,
        moved ∈ projectionOrbit base ∧ moved ≠ base) :
    OrbitHasNoFixedPoint (projectionOrbit base) := by
  rcases nontrivial with
    ⟨moved, ⟨movingAutomorphism, movingEquality⟩, movedNeBase⟩
  intro projection projectionMember
  rcases projectionMember with
    ⟨through, throughEquality⟩
  refine ⟨conjugateAut through movingAutomorphism, ?_⟩
  intro fixed
  have transportedMoved := fixed
  rw [← throughEquality] at transportedMoved
  rw [MonoHierarchy.transport_trans] at transportedMoved
  have conjugateEquivalence :
      through.1.trans (conjugateAut through movingAutomorphism).1 =
        movingAutomorphism.1.trans through.1 :=
    congrArg Subtype.val
      (conjugate_identity through movingAutomorphism)
  rw [conjugateEquivalence] at transportedMoved
  rw [← MonoHierarchy.transport_trans] at transportedMoved
  rw [movingEquality] at transportedMoved
  have movedEqualsBase :=
    MonoHierarchy.transport_injective through.1
      transportedMoved
  exact movedNeBase movedEqualsBase

end Mathematics.Projection
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/AC320725d5d6218ac/Variant6f2a5b2187659670938b4992607d922c5d4f370691e6f1319203c95db2eb13fb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/AC320725d5d6218ac/Variant6f2a5b2187659670938b4992607d922c5d4f370691e6f1319203c95db2eb13fb.lean#L31).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fe668d6cae1bb129be050e8d8aa404640371993f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
