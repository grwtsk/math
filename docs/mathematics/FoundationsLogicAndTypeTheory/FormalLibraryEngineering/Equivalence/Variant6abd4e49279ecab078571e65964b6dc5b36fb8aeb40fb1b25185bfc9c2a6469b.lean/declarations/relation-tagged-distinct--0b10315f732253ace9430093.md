## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8d86151a-10e5-ef13-f1e3-73b566bab0e2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1292–1304.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem relation_tagged_distinct (t u : Fin 3) (htu : t ≠ u) {x z : Expr S}
    (hx : HasType P Γ x B.xType) (mx : WellModed γ x .data)
    (hz : HasType P Γ z B.xType) (mz : WellModed γ z .data) :
    Proves P Γ γ (L.neg (B.relation L.code KY.code KP.code (B.observation.tagged L.code t x)
      (B.observation.tagged L.code u z))) := by
  have ht := H.observation.tagged_typed t hx mx
  have hu := H.observation.tagged_typed u hz mz
  have he := H.observation_equivalence KY KP ht.1 ht.2 hu.1 hu.2
  have hn := H.observation.ae_tagged_distinct KY KP t u htu hx mx hz mz
  have hf := H.relation_formula KY KP ht.1 ht.2 hu.1 hu.2
  have fa := H.observation.ae_formula KY KP ht.1 ht.2 hu.1 hu.2
  pts_pl L using [he,hn]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Equivalence/Variant6abd4e49279ecab078571e65964b6dc5b36fb8aeb40fb1b25185bfc9c2a6469b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Equivalence/Variant6abd4e49279ecab078571e65964b6dc5b36fb8aeb40fb1b25185bfc9c2a6469b.lean#L1292).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `080545f485bd6f356ed655974b18733359d13535` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
