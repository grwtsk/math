## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6405bad0-b787-c8b3-b834-80f61f09f547`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 796–807.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem feature_respect {f : ObservationFeature S} (hf : B.FeatureFormed (P := P) Γ γ f)
    {y z : Expr S} (hy : HasType P Γ y B.yType) (my : WellModed γ y .data)
    (hz : HasType P Γ z B.yType) (mz : WellModed γ z .data)
    (he : Proves P Γ γ (B.observation.ae L.code KY.code KP.code y z)) :
    Equivalent P Γ γ (B.feature L.code KY.code KP.code f y) (B.feature L.code KY.code KP.code
      f z) := by
  obtain ⟨hi,ho,hc⟩ := H.observation.ae_elim KY KP hy my hz mz he
  cases f with
  | inner => exact hi
  | outer => exact ho
  | probe i => exact H.observation.compare_elim KY KP hy my hz mz hf.1 hf.2 hc

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Equivalence/Variant00977098b6c8c0dc80ad7e4aaf51c70e8deeea440c7658646df42d1e56e9c1a2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Equivalence/Variant00977098b6c8c0dc80ad7e4aaf51c70e8deeea440c7658646df42d1e56e9c1a2.lean#L796).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `43f1fd568fc593415ed142c039d5eba888e0c9de` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
