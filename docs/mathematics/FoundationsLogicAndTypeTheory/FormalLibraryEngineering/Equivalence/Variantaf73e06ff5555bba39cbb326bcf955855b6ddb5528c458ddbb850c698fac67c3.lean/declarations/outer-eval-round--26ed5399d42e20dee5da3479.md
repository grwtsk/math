## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1fec3ea9-fd9a-3ff7-5cdf-026ac25c3c73`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 328–341.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem outer_eval_round {y Q : Expr S}
    (hy : HasType P Γ y B.yType) (my : WellModed γ y .data)
    (hQ : L.Family (B.observation.copies.middleType B.relational.probe.carrier) Q) :
    Equivalent P Γ γ
      (B.observation.outer.eval (B.observation.copies.middleType B.relational.probe.carrier)
        (B.round y) Q)
      (B.observation.outer.eval (B.observation.copies.middleType B.relational.probe.carrier) y
        Q) := by
  have hq := (H.observation.outer.first.sound H.middle_sorted H.middle_mode).1 Q hQ
  have he := H.relational_formed.channel.primitive_round H.base_sorted H.base_mode
    (H.shape ▸ hy) my (H.outer_first_shape ▸ hq.1) hq.2
  simpa only [DoubleCode.eval,H.outer_second_shape,H.outer_first_shape,round,
    RelationalCode.channel] using he

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Equivalence/Variantaf73e06ff5555bba39cbb326bcf955855b6ddb5528c458ddbb850c698fac67c3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Equivalence/Variantaf73e06ff5555bba39cbb326bcf955855b6ddb5528c458ddbb850c698fac67c3.lean#L328).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `57f5c672add74f123151628cee1e5dcf9a22df0c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
