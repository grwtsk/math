## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:eef1560777480837229d5ccfb319b524f0255bbd0a14e034075d3e4ae643ba4a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 158–170.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def elabInitGrindNorm : CommandElab := fun stx =>
  withExporting do  -- should generate public aux decls
  match stx with
  | `(init_grind_norm $pre:ident* | $post*) =>
    Command.liftTermElabM do
      let pre ← pre.mapM fun id => realizeGlobalConstNoOverloadWithInfo id
      let post ← post.mapM fun id => realizeGlobalConstNoOverloadWithInfo id
      -- Creates `Lean.Grind._simp_1` etc.. As we do not use this command in independent modules,
      -- there is no chance of name conflicts.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Main/Variant0b2abc22b14f74b35d4bd0aa4d93c2defc4ba66c9ec920559eb5196ecc6c04df.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Main/Variant0b2abc22b14f74b35d4bd0aa4d93c2defc4ba66c9ec920559eb5196ecc6c04df.lean#L158).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93798e57a87dfaf7967adb2e3d16f3091a812a55` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
