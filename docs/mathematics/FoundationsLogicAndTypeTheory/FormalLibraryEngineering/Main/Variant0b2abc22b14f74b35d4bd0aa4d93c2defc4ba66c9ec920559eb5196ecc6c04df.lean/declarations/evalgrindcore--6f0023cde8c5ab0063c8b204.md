## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a600a4ecfef9246bb4107680f8d2cf23dffb705982cbe14d0806864fdda7dc90`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 289–303.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def evalGrindCore
    (ref : Syntax)
    (config : Grind.Config)
    (only : Option Syntax)
    (params? : Option (Syntax.TSepArray `Lean.Parser.Tactic.grindParam ","))
    (seq? : Option (TSyntax `Lean.Parser.Tactic.Grind.grindSeq))
    (extensions? : Option Grind.ExtensionStateArray := none)
    : TacticM Unit := do
  let only := only.isSome
  let params := if let some params := params? then params.getElems else #[]
  if Grind.grind.warning.get (← getOptions) then
    logWarningAt ref "The `grind` tactic is new and its behavior may change in the future. This project has used `set_option grind.warning true` to discourage its use."
  grind (← getMainGoal) config only params seq? (extensions? := extensions?)

/-- Position for the `[..]` child syntax in the `grind` tactic. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Main/Variant0b2abc22b14f74b35d4bd0aa4d93c2defc4ba66c9ec920559eb5196ecc6c04df.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Main/Variant0b2abc22b14f74b35d4bd0aa4d93c2defc4ba66c9ec920559eb5196ecc6c04df.lean#L289).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93798e57a87dfaf7967adb2e3d16f3091a812a55` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
