## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d2ff7794b080d79743e168cf22dd3b2348ae6daf624409675d1c085772a3a38f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 170–194.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def elabGrindSuggestions
    (params : Grind.Params) (suggestions : Array Suggestion := #[]) : MetaM Grind.Params := do
  let mut params := params
  let mut added : Array Name := #[]
  for p in suggestions do
    let attr ← match p.flag with
    | some flag => parseModifier flag
    | none => pure <| .ematch (.default false)
    match attr with
    | .ematch kind =>
      try
        params ← addEMatchTheorem params (mkIdent p.name) p.name kind false (warn := false)
        added := added.push p.name
      catch _ => pure () -- Don't worry if library suggestions gave bad theorems.
    | _ =>
      -- We could actually support arbitrary grind modifiers,
      -- and call `processParam` rather than `addEMatchTheorem`,
      -- but this would require a larger refactor.
      -- Let's only do this if there is a prospect of a library suggestion engine supporting this.
      throwError "unexpected modifier {p.flag}"
  unless added.isEmpty do
    trace[grind.debug.suggestions] "{added}"
  return params

/-- Add all definitions from the current file. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Main/Variant00d200bdea6e17b5a1da15be82f15066065eb1e89d844a3ce8a60b1eb0ef905c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Main/Variant00d200bdea6e17b5a1da15be82f15066065eb1e89d844a3ce8a60b1eb0ef905c.lean#L170).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `788dba46ec685bbf05cff5ba54441b470b0dc60d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
