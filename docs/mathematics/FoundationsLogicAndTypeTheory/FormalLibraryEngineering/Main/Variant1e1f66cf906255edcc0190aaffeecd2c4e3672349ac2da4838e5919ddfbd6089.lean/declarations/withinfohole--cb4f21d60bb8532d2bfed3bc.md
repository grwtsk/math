## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:156759c6408393884ab26dd169dd10fa1249b940de1f2ba423509bfc418964cb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 396–407.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[inline] def withInfoHole [MonadFinally m] [Monad m] [MonadInfoTree m] (mvarId : MVarId) (x : m α) : m α := do
  if (← getInfoState).enabled then
    let treesSaved ← getResetInfoTrees
    Prod.fst <$> MonadFinally.tryFinally' x fun _ => modifyInfoState fun s =>
      if h : s.trees.size > 0 then
        have : s.trees.size - 1 < s.trees.size := Nat.sub_lt h (by decide)
        { s with trees := treesSaved, assignment := s.assignment.insert mvarId s.trees[s.trees.size - 1] }
      else
        { s with trees := treesSaved }
  else
    x

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Main/Variant1e1f66cf906255edcc0190aaffeecd2c4e3672349ac2da4838e5919ddfbd6089.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Main/Variant1e1f66cf906255edcc0190aaffeecd2c4e3672349ac2da4838e5919ddfbd6089.lean#L396).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c0bfe195920efb6aa1186ad04141f4cbcfde72f4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
