## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e81801a53b5baa31b9bbea82cce32792e2a1f76dc2b7387e20d6ac43ade751f8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–112.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkMethods (evalTactic? : Option EvalTactic := none) : CoreM Methods := do
  let builtinPropagators ← builtinPropagatorsRef.get
  let evalTactic : EvalTactic := evalTactic?.getD EvalTactic.skip
  return {
    evalTactic
    propagateUp := fun e => do
      propagateForallPropUp e
      propagateReflCmp e
      let .const declName _ := e.getAppFn | return ()
      propagateProjEq e
      propagateCtorIdxUp e
      if let some props := builtinPropagators.up[declName]? then
       props.forM fun prop => prop e
    propagateDown := fun e => do
      propagateForallPropDown e
      propagateLawfulEqCmp e
      let .const declName _ := e.getAppFn | return ()
      if let some props := builtinPropagators.down[declName]? then
       props.forM fun prop => prop e
  }

-- A `simp` discharger that does not use assumptions.
-- We use it to make sure we don't have to reset the `simp` cache used in `grind`.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Main/Variant941333e774241de900041dd39daa1cb4098a713de8f66683baca2ef0978a2d70.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Main/Variant941333e774241de900041dd39daa1cb4098a713de8f66683baca2ef0978a2d70.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d98d219265fc2517ab7714bf434b550586a7bfa5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
