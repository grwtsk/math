## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `syntax` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:aa4f99f4639cc0c369c1dddca9180831dd04247c352e3aa335eaee190dc92413`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 165–178.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
syntax (name := clearValue) "clear_value" (ppSpace colGt clearValueArg)+ : tactic

/--
`subst x...` substitutes each hypothesis `x` with a definition found in the local context,
then eliminates the hypothesis.
- If `x` is a local definition, then its definition is used.
- Otherwise, if there is a hypothesis of the form `x = e` or `e = x`,
  then `e` is used for the definition of `x`.

If `h : a = b`, then `subst h` may be used if either `a` or `b` unfolds to a local hypothesis.
This is similar to the `cases h` tactic.

See also: `subst_vars` for substituting all local hypotheses that have a defining equation.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Tactics/Variant6a77673e818ee8410267bebc5086e4eddcdf3809d466b6d088963f6e58ee8813.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Tactics/Variant6a77673e818ee8410267bebc5086e4eddcdf3809d466b6d088963f6e58ee8813.lean#L165).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2cf74f441f09be38b6ccdbb0f9a93688d8a2e2cf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
