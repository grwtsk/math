## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `syntax` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fbdefeba70643c6f31fcc906a350a5c17e55dd4e0e6dfb4ba9ba8975d890e6d0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2416–2469.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
syntax (name := decide_cbv) "decide_cbv" : tactic

end Tactic

namespace Attr
/--
Theorems tagged with the `simp` attribute are used by the simplifier
(i.e., the `simp` tactic, and its variants) to simplify expressions occurring in your goals.
We call theorems tagged with the `simp` attribute "simp theorems" or "simp lemmas".
Lean maintains a database/index containing all active simp theorems.
Here is an example of a simp theorem.
```lean
@[simp] theorem ne_eq (a b : α) : (a ≠ b) = Not (a = b) := rfl
```
This simp theorem instructs the simplifier to replace instances of the term
`a ≠ b` (e.g. `x + 0 ≠ y`) with `Not (a = b)` (e.g., `Not (x + 0 = y)`).
The simplifier applies simp theorems in one direction only:
if `A = B` is a simp theorem, then `simp` replaces `A`s with `B`s,
but it doesn't replace `B`s with `A`s. Hence a simp theorem should have the
property that its right-hand side is "simpler" than its left-hand side.
In particular, `=` and `↔` should not be viewed as symmetric operators in this situation.
The following would be a terrible simp theorem (if it were even allowed):
```lean
@[simp] lemma mul_right_inv_bad (a : G) : 1 = a * a⁻¹ := ...
```
Replacing 1 with a * a⁻¹ is not a sensible default direction to travel.
Even worse would be a theorem that causes expressions to grow without bound,
causing simp to loop forever.

By default the simplifier applies `simp` theorems to an expression `e`
after its sub-expressions have been simplified.
We say it performs a bottom-up simplification.
You can instruct the simplifier to apply a theorem before its sub-expressions
have been simplified by using the modifier `↓`. Here is an example
```lean
@[simp↓] theorem not_and_eq (p q : Prop) : (¬ (p ∧ q)) = (¬p ∨ ¬q) :=
```

You can instruct the simplifier to rewrite the lemma from right-to-left:
```lean
attribute @[simp ←] and_assoc
```

When multiple simp theorems are applicable, the simplifier uses the one with highest priority.
The equational theorems of functions are applied at very low priority (100 and below).
If there are several with the same priority, it is uses the "most recent one". Example:
```lean
@[simp high] theorem cond_true (a b : α) : cond true a b = a := rfl
@[simp low+1] theorem or_true (p : Prop) : (p ∨ True) = True :=
  propext <| Iff.intro (fun _ => trivial) (fun _ => Or.inr trivial)
@[simp 100] theorem ite_self {d : Decidable c} (a : α) : ite c a a = a := by
  cases d <;> rfl
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Tactics/Variant6a77673e818ee8410267bebc5086e4eddcdf3809d466b6d088963f6e58ee8813.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
