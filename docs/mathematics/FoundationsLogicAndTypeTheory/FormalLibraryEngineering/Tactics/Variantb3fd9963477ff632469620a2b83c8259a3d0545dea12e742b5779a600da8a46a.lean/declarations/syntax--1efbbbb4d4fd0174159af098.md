## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `syntax` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4e02d01037fa3ca7c3c0677d36b23f35194e6652c355169154a08a436b863a5f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 50–108.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
syntax (name := intro) "intro" notFollowedBy("|") (ppSpace colGt term:max)* : tactic

/--
`intros` repeatedly applies `intro` to introduce zero or more hypotheses
until the goal is no longer a *binding expression*
(i.e., a universal quantifier, function type, implication, or `have`/`let`),
without performing any definitional reductions (no unfolding, beta, eta, etc.).
The introduced hypotheses receive inaccessible (hygienic) names.

`intros x y z` is equivalent to `intro x y z` and exists only for historical reasons.
The `intro` tactic should be preferred in this case.

## Properties and relations

- `intros` succeeds even when it introduces no hypotheses.

- `repeat intro` is like `intros`, but it performs definitional reductions
  to expose binders, and as such it may introduce more hypotheses than `intros`.

- `intros` is equivalent to `intro _ _ … _`,
  with the fewest trailing `_` placeholders needed so that the goal is no longer a binding expression.
  The trailing introductions do not perform any definitional reductions.

## Examples

Implications:
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p → q → p := by
  intros
  /- Tactic state
     a✝¹ : p
     a✝ : q
     ⊢ p      -/
  assumption
```

Let-bindings:
```lean
example : let n := 1; let k := 2; n + k = 3 := by
  intros
  /- n✝ : Nat := 1
     k✝ : Nat := 2
     ⊢ n✝ + k✝ = 3 -/
  rfl
```

Does not unfold definitions:
```lean
def AllEven (f : Nat → Nat) := ∀ n, f n % 2 = 0

example : ∀ (f : Nat → Nat), AllEven f → AllEven (fun k => f (k + 1)) := by
  intros
  /- Tactic state
     f✝ : Nat → Nat
     a✝ : AllEven f✝
     ⊢ AllEven fun k => f✝ (k + 1) -/
  sorry
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Tactics/Variantb3fd9963477ff632469620a2b83c8259a3d0545dea12e742b5779a600da8a46a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Tactics/Variantb3fd9963477ff632469620a2b83c8259a3d0545dea12e742b5779a600da8a46a.lean#L50).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1bafb4df56922fab687e1bea8e5a6c4d8fc5083d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
