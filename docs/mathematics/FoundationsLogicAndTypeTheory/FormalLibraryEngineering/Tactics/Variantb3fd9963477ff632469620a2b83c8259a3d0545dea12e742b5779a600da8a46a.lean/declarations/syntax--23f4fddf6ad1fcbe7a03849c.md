## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `syntax` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:39192186b1c6d125f0ad300f9b2b70af7666346def53e26e2fb5c91a0a2b108e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 552–569.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
syntax (name := extractLets) "extract_lets" ppSpace optConfig (ppSpace colGt (ident <|> hole))* (location)? : tactic

/--
Lifts `let` and `have` expressions within a term as far out as possible.
It is like `extract_lets +lift`, but the top-level lets at the end of the procedure
are not extracted as local hypotheses.

- `lift_lets` lifts let expressions in the target.
- `lift_lets at h` lifts let expressions at the given local hypothesis.

For example,
```lean
example : (let x := 1; x) = 1 := by
  lift_lets
  -- ⊢ let x := 1; x = 1
  ...
```

````

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Tactics/Variantb3fd9963477ff632469620a2b83c8259a3d0545dea12e742b5779a600da8a46a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Tactics/Variantb3fd9963477ff632469620a2b83c8259a3d0545dea12e742b5779a600da8a46a.lean#L552).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1bafb4df56922fab687e1bea8e5a6c4d8fc5083d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
