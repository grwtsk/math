## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5c69c64bf5d7613f665a1de0e934e02ab657787602d1054391440f60a923537e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 231–240.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def exprPoly_supp : ExprSupported exprPoly :=
  ExprSupported.add
    (ExprSupported.add
      (ExprSupported.mul (ExprSupported.const 2)
        (ExprSupported.mul (ExprSupported.var 0) (ExprSupported.var 0)))
      (ExprSupported.mul (ExprSupported.const 3) (ExprSupported.var 0)))
    (ExprSupported.const 1)

/-- Example: 2x² + 3x + 1 ≤ 6 for all x ∈ [0, 1] using native_decide.
    At x=1: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Tactics/Variantcf6fb04af000ccc56d3d17dee069dd775c47c28a02a3921dd210a108a7c71644.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Tactics/Variantcf6fb04af000ccc56d3d17dee069dd775c47c28a02a3921dd210a108a7c71644.lean#L231).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3605afc794721633203ece297d9271b7e312967c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
