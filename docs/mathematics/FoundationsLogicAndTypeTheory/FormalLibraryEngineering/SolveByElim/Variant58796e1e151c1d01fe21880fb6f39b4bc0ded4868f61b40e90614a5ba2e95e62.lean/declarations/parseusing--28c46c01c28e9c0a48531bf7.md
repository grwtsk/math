## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bca48693766fffefef3e28c226aad3fd813a250235e811a38f895ff9ac0c58ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 370–413.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def parseUsing (s : Option (TSyntax ``using_)) : Array Ident :=
  match s with
  | some s => match s with
    | `(using_ | using $ids,*) => ids.getElems
    | _ => #[]
  | none => #[]

/--
`solve_by_elim` calls `apply` on the main goal to find an assumption whose head matches
and then repeatedly calls `apply` on the generated subgoals until no subgoals remain,
performing at most `maxDepth` (defaults to 6) recursive steps.

`solve_by_elim` discharges the current goal or fails.

`solve_by_elim` performs backtracking if subgoals can not be solved.

By default, the assumptions passed to `apply` are the local context, `rfl`, `trivial`,
`congrFun` and `congrArg`.

The assumptions can be modified with similar syntax as for `simp`:
* `solve_by_elim [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` also applies the given expressions.
* `solve_by_elim only [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` does not include the local context,
  `rfl`, `trivial`, `congrFun`, or `congrArg` unless they are explicitly included.
* `solve_by_elim [-h₁, ... -hₙ]` removes the given local hypotheses.
* `solve_by_elim using [a₁, ...]` uses all lemmas which have been labelled
  with the attributes `aᵢ` (these attributes must be created using `register_label_attr`).

`solve_by_elim*` tries to solve all goals together, using backtracking if a solution for one goal
makes other goals impossible.
(Adding or removing local hypotheses may not be well-behaved when starting with multiple goals.)

Optional arguments passed via a configuration argument as `solve_by_elim (config := { ... })`
- `maxDepth`: number of attempts at discharging generated subgoals
- `symm`: adds all hypotheses derived by `symm` (defaults to `true`).
- `exfalso`: allow calling `exfalso` and trying again if `solve_by_elim` fails
  (defaults to `true`).
- `transparency`: change the transparency mode when calling `apply`. Defaults to `.default`,
  but it is often useful to change to `.reducible`,
  so semireducible definitions will not be unfolded when trying to apply a lemma.

See also the doc-comment for `Mathlib.Tactic.BacktrackConfig` for the options
`proc`, `suspend`, and `discharge` which allow further customization of `solve_by_elim`.
Both `apply_assumption` and `apply_rules` are implemented via these hooks.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SolveByElim/Variant58796e1e151c1d01fe21880fb6f39b4bc0ded4868f61b40e90614a5ba2e95e62.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SolveByElim/Variant58796e1e151c1d01fe21880fb6f39b4bc0ded4868f61b40e90614a5ba2e95e62.lean#L370).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5edc6405bb9d3379ec16ad71ee3afa318d241a43` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
