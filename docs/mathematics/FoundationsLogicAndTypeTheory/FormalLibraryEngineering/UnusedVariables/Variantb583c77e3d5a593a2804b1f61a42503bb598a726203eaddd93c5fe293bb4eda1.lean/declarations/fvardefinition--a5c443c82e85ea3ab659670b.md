## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f918f31fdbda7b89b276d20ede324be24484d5441568c12f7b83143a6d01a1e4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 351–365.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure FVarDefinition where
  /-- The user-provided name of the `FVarId` -/
  userName : Name
  /-- A (usually `.ident`) syntax for the defined variable -/
  stx : Syntax
  /-- The options set locally to this part of the syntax (used by `IgnoreFn`) -/
  opts : Options
  /-- The list of all `FVarId`s that are considered as being defined at this position.
  This can have more than one element if multiple variables are declared by the same
  syntax, such as the `h` in `if h : c then ... else ...`. We only report an unused variable
  at this span if all variables in `aliases` are unused. -/
  aliases : Array FVarId

/-- The main data structure used to collect information from the info tree regarding unused
variables. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/UnusedVariables/Variantb583c77e3d5a593a2804b1f61a42503bb598a726203eaddd93c5fe293bb4eda1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/UnusedVariables/Variantb583c77e3d5a593a2804b1f61a42503bb598a726203eaddd93c5fe293bb4eda1.lean#L351).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5fffdbe0d2d380a83e0aa43656b54af7c56c7b8c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
