## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2267fe0ba750e11baba2133c227b435e531814433f00983ac07cd4ddb3fb4c5d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 119–132.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getLinterUnusedVariablesPatternVars (o : LinterOptions) : Bool :=
  o.get linter.unusedVariables.patternVars.name (getLinterUnusedVariables o)

/-- An `IgnoreFunction` receives:

* a `Syntax.ident` for the unused variable
* a `Syntax.Stack` with the location of this piece of syntax in the command
* The `LinterOptions` set locally to this syntax

and should return `true` to indicate that the lint should be suppressed,
or `false` to proceed with linting as usual (other `IgnoreFunction`s may still
say it is ignored). A variable is only linted if it is unused and no
`IgnoreFunction` returns `true` on this syntax.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/UnusedVariables/Variantb583c77e3d5a593a2804b1f61a42503bb598a726203eaddd93c5fe293bb4eda1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/UnusedVariables/Variantb583c77e3d5a593a2804b1f61a42503bb598a726203eaddd93c5fe293bb4eda1.lean#L119).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5fffdbe0d2d380a83e0aa43656b54af7c56c7b8c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
