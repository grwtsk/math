## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:192d0093c5eef3476a2e62dccdd17a34002afd872bcc85e857d334da7d9ecf59`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 595–629.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def whnfDelayedAssigned? (f' : Expr) (e : Expr) : MetaM (Option Expr) := do
  if f'.isMVar then
    match (← getDelayedMVarAssignment? f'.mvarId!) with
    | none => return none
    | some { fvars, mvarIdPending } =>
      let args := e.getAppArgs
      if fvars.size > args.size then
        -- Insufficient number of argument to expand delayed assignment
        return none
      else
        let newVal ← instantiateMVars (mkMVar mvarIdPending)
        if newVal.hasExprMVar then
           -- Delayed assignment still contains metavariables
           return none
        else
           let newVal := newVal.abstract fvars
           let result := newVal.instantiateRevRange 0 fvars.size args
           return mkAppRange result fvars.size args.size args
  else
    return none

/--
Zeta reduces `let`s/`have`s.
If `zetaHave` is false, then `have`s are not zeta reduced.

Auxiliary function for `whnfCore` and `Simp.reduceStep`, to implement the `zeta` option.
This function does not implement `zetaUnused` logic,
which is instead the responsibility of `consumeUnusedLet`.
The `expandLet` function works with expressions with loose bound variables,
and thus determining whether a let variable is used isn't an O(1) operation.

Note: since `expandLet` and `consumeUnusedLet` are separated like this, a consequence is that
in the `+zeta -zetaHave +zetaUnused` configuration, then `whnfCore` has quadratic complexity
when reducing a sequence of alternating `let`s and `have`s where the `let`s are used but the `have`s are unused.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/WHNF/Variant4c7efb426ead0cd2c5bc33c16fdab8f1ddd325d0c2e3468f7d507b76ab3d3e3e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/WHNF/Variant4c7efb426ead0cd2c5bc33c16fdab8f1ddd325d0c2e3468f7d507b76ab3d3e3e.lean#L595).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `768e0c93dea2a79dd5ab505c68bbcac736238c91` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
