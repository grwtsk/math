## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:40339308e46b416d558c6851ee39dae8a9758111637ae63def2f522e21e93633`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1104–1123.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def whnfImp (e : Expr) : MetaM Expr :=
  withIncRecDepth <| whnfEasyCases e fun e => do
    let useCache ← useWHNFCache e
    match (← cached? useCache e) with
    | some e' => pure e'
    | none    =>
      withTraceNode `Meta.whnf (fun _ => return m!"Non-easy whnf: {e}") do
        checkSystem "whnf"
        let e' ← whnfCore e
        match (← reduceNat? e') with
        | some v => cache useCache e v
        | none   =>
          match (← reduceNative? e') with
          | some v => cache useCache e v
          | none   =>
            match (← unfoldDefinition? e') with
            | some e'' => cache useCache e (← whnfImp e'')
            | none => cache useCache e e'

/-- If `e` is a projection function that satisfies `p`, then reduce it -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/WHNF/Varianta7dda85d86ae0a7118566b80e0f8cd274030846e371d156f6882713d48647836.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/WHNF/Varianta7dda85d86ae0a7118566b80e0f8cd274030846e371d156f6882713d48647836.lean#L1104).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f31a765ed75b6fbe3ae881a93afdf3152f18a53f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
