## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6ec1181c32237fc3e1d2ee0f802245b08e9148c69fbd7b4fc3da36fba91efea6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 848–858.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[inline] def run (x : CheckAssignmentM Expr) (mvarId : MVarId) (fvars : Array Expr) (hasCtxLocals : Bool) (v : Expr) : MetaM (Option Expr) := do
  let mvarDecl ← mvarId.getDecl
  let ctx := { mvarId := mvarId, mvarDecl := mvarDecl, fvars := fvars, hasCtxLocals := hasCtxLocals, rhs := v : Context }
  let x : CheckAssignmentM (Option Expr) :=
    catchInternalIds [outOfScopeExceptionId, checkAssignmentExceptionId]
      (do let e ← x; return some e)
      (fun _ => pure none)
  x.run ctx |>.run' {}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExprDefEq/Variant55a71bf324abab1d452a49901c3e1d836b8b355d057d92f54f28390ec94759be.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExprDefEq/Variant55a71bf324abab1d452a49901c3e1d836b8b355d057d92f54f28390ec94759be.lean#L848).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8bbd010584f31382615499820e7b562d16998fee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
