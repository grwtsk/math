## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ded707d4d259deb16d6444fd9a78a9010d700336252c6ffde8d8b5e363b64697`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 253–318.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  Failed to establish that explicit arguments are def-eq.
  Remark: higher output parameters, and parameters that depend on them
  are postponed.
  -/
  | failed
  /--
  Succeeded. The array `postponedImplicit` contains the position
  of the implicit arguments for which def-eq has been postponed.
  `postponedHO` contains the higher order output parameters, and parameters
  that depend on them. They should be processed after the implicit ones.
  `postponedHO` is used to handle applications involving functions that
  contain higher order output parameters. Example:
  ```lean
  getElem :
    {cont : Type u_1} → {idx : Type u_2} → {elem : Type u_3} →
    {dom : cont → idx → Prop} → [self : GetElem cont idx elem dom] →
    (xs : cont) → (i : idx) → (h : dom xs i) → elem
  ```
  The arguments `dom` and `h` must be processed after all implicit arguments
  otherwise higher-order unification problems are generated. See issue #1299,
  when trying to solve
  ```
  getElem ?a ?i ?h =?= getElem a i (Fin.val_lt_of_le i ...)
  ```
  we have to solve the constraint
  ```
  ?dom a i.val =?= LT.lt i.val (Array.size a)
  ```
  by solving after the instance has been synthesized, we reduce this constraint to
  a simple check.
  -/
  | ok (postponedImplicit : Array Nat) (postponedHO : Array Nat)

/--
  First pass for `isDefEqArgs`. We unify explicit arguments, *and* easy cases
  Here, we say a case is easy if it is of the form

       ?m =?= t
       or
       t  =?= ?m

  where `?m` is unassigned.

  These easy cases are not just an optimization. When
  `?m` is a function, by assigning it to t, we make sure
  a unification constraint (in the explicit part)
  ```
  ?m t =?= f s
  ```
  is not higher-order.

  We also handle the eta-expanded cases:
  ```
  fun x₁ ... xₙ => ?m x₁ ... xₙ =?= t
  t =?= fun x₁ ... xₙ => ?m x₁ ... xₙ
  ```
  This is important because type inference often produces
  eta-expanded terms, and without this extra case, we could
  introduce counter intuitive behavior.

  Pre: `paramInfo.size <= args₁.size = args₂.size`

  See `DefEqArgsFirstPassResult` for additional information.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExprDefEq/Variant0be5ead1c11aa486f924948f2a0b7946284fbc2f0b899993dd8989f1a9370b27.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExprDefEq/Variant0be5ead1c11aa486f924948f2a0b7946284fbc2f0b899993dd8989f1a9370b27.lean#L253).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
