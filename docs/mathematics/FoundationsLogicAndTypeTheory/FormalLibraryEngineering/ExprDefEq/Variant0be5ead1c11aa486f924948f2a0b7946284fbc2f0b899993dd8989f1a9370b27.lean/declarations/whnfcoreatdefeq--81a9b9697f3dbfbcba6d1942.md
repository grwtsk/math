## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1b4d0e8e1c0c9f023298b369f9a94a5d9f1ef0c856a48faaea7c611845b8be95`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2277–2284.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def whnfCoreAtDefEq (e : Expr) : MetaM Expr := do
  if backward.isDefEq.lazyWhnfCore.get (← getOptions) then
    withConfig (fun ctx => { ctx with proj := .yesWithDeltaI }) <| whnfCore e
  else
    whnfCore e

set_option compiler.ignoreBorrowAnnotation true in
@[export lean_is_expr_def_eq]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExprDefEq/Variant0be5ead1c11aa486f924948f2a0b7946284fbc2f0b899993dd8989f1a9370b27.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExprDefEq/Variant0be5ead1c11aa486f924948f2a0b7946284fbc2f0b899993dd8989f1a9370b27.lean#L2277).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e9f4ab278fb0aaa00932b1b6c8aaced78f8475cc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
