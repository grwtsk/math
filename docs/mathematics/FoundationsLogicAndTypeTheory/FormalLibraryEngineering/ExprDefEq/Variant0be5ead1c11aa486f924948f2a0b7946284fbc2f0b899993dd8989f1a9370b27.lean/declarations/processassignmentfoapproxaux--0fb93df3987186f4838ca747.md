## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5f7810634907f9885a7bb823e23c9c77b35d3a9d5a64b2b7d190cfa8c86d531d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1184–1209.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def processAssignmentFOApproxAux (mvar : Expr) (args : Array Expr) (v : Expr) : MetaM Bool :=
  match v with
  | .mdata _ e => processAssignmentFOApproxAux mvar args e
  | .app f a   =>
    if args.isEmpty then
      pure false
    else
      Meta.isExprDefEqAux args.back! a <&&> Meta.isExprDefEqAux (mkAppRange mvar 0 (args.size - 1) args) f
  | _ => pure false

/--
  Auxiliary method for applying first-order unification. It is an approximation.
  Remark: this method is trying to solve the unification constraint:

      ?m a₁ ... aₙ =?= v

   It is uses processAssignmentFOApproxAux, if it fails, it tries to unfold `v`.

   We have added support for unfolding here because we want to be able to solve unification problems such as

      ?m Unit =?= ITactic

   where `ITactic` is defined as

   def ITactic := Tactic Unit
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExprDefEq/Variant0be5ead1c11aa486f924948f2a0b7946284fbc2f0b899993dd8989f1a9370b27.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ExprDefEq/Variant0be5ead1c11aa486f924948f2a0b7946284fbc2f0b899993dd8989f1a9370b27.lean#L1184).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e9f4ab278fb0aaa00932b1b6c8aaced78f8475cc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
