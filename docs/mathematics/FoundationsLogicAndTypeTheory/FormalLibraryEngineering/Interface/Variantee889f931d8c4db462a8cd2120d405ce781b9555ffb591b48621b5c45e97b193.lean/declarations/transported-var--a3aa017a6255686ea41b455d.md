## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:60cc280e-bd81-60f4-11cf-7d36dee9efa3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 317–334.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem transported_var {Γ : List (Expr S)} {A : Expr S} {i : Nat}
    (ht : HasType P Γ (.var i) A) (e : J.Env Γ) (ha : J.Admissible (U := U) e) :
    J.Transported (.var i) A e := by
  obtain ⟨B,hB,hc⟩ := ht.generation
  obtain ⟨s,hBs⟩ := HasType.lookup_sorted ht.valid hB
  have hea := Expected.of_type ht
  apply Transported.convert (A := B) (hA := .sorted hBs) (hB := hea) (hc := .symm _ _ hc)
  have hdr := ha i B hB
  by_cases hBU : Profile P Γ B ∈ U
  · apply J.transported_of_ground (.sorted hBs)
    exact H.top_ground_generic hw hBs (J.typed e) hBU
      ⟨(J.typed e i B hB).normalize_type hw,hdr.2.1 hBU⟩
  · by_cases hBC : Profile P Γ B ∈ C
    · exact ⟨hdr.1 hBC,fun _ hn => False.elim (hn hBC)⟩
    · exact J.transported_of_ground (.sorted hBs) (hdr.2.2 hBU hBC)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Interface/Variantee889f931d8c4db462a8cd2120d405ce781b9555ffb591b48621b5c45e97b193.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Interface/Variantee889f931d8c4db462a8cd2120d405ce781b9555ffb591b48621b5c45e97b193.lean#L317).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c360bbd4f3637b2b82c46fa4765135191b47789c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
