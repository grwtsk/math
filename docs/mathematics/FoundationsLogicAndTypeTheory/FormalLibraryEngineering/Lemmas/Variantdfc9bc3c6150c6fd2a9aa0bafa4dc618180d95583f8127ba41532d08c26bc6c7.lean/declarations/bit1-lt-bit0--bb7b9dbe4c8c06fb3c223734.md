## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:74390d25-0c28-aa25-72c2-09dac5df124e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 346–354.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem bit1_lt_bit0 : ∀ {n m : Nat}, n < m → bit1 n < bit0 m
  | n, 0, h => absurd h n.not_lt_zero
  | n, succ m, h =>
    have : n ≤ m := le_of_lt_succ h
    have : succ (n + n) ≤ succ (m + m) := succ_le_succ (Nat.add_le_add this this)
    have : succ (n + n) ≤ succ m + m := by rw [succ_add]; assumption
    show succ (n + n) < succ (succ m + m) from lt_succ_of_le this
#align nat.bit1_lt_bit0 Nat.bit1_lt_bit0

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Lemmas/Variantdfc9bc3c6150c6fd2a9aa0bafa4dc618180d95583f8127ba41532d08c26bc6c7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Lemmas/Variantdfc9bc3c6150c6fd2a9aa0bafa4dc618180d95583f8127ba41532d08c26bc6c7.lean#L346).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b6fde284bbafe7fc0bd0913c608209fa2812188a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
