## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2cafa1c082d60dd0fe4ed8c1710444f33fbde3f641c29d89e2c6aa1d1cc6d25c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 425–444.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public instance {α : Type u} [LE α] [Min α] [IsLinearPreorder α] [LawfulOrderLeftLeaningMin α] :
    LawfulOrderMin α where
  toMinEqOr := inferInstance
  le_min_iff a b c := by
    open scoped Classical in
    suffices min_eq : min b c = if b ≤ c then b else c by
      rw [min_eq]
      split <;> rename_i hbc
      · simp only [iff_self_and]
        exact fun hab => le_trans hab hbc
      · simp only [iff_and_self]
        exact fun hac => le_trans hac (by simpa [hbc] using Std.le_total (a := b) (b := c))
    split <;> simp [*, LawfulOrderLeftLeaningMin.min_eq_left, LawfulOrderLeftLeaningMin.min_eq_right]

end Min
end Std

namespace Classical.Order
open Std

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Lemmas/Variant4c42faa9c133e6e77bc1b972c28d67b9c676d90a32a5c63ea95612c5aa4581c1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Lemmas/Variant4c42faa9c133e6e77bc1b972c28d67b9c676d90a32a5c63ea95612c5aa4581c1.lean#L425).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `74c0ecf0a0e787c3e6e0045f3c8c872aa1b333a4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
