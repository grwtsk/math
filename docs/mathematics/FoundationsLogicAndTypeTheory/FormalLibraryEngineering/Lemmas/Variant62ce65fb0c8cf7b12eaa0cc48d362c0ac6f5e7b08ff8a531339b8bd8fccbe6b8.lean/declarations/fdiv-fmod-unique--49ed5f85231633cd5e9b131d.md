## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d8f97974-dff9-9d78-876a-b39d0ef8350a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2380–2386.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem fdiv_fmod_unique' {a b r q : Int} (h : b < 0) :
    a.fdiv b = q ∧ a.fmod b = r ↔ r + b * q = a ∧ b < r ∧ r ≤ 0 := by
  have := Int.fdiv_fmod_unique (a := -a) (b := -b) (r := -r) (q := q) (by omega)
  simp at this
  simp [this, Int.neg_mul]
  omega

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Lemmas/Variant62ce65fb0c8cf7b12eaa0cc48d362c0ac6f5e7b08ff8a531339b8bd8fccbe6b8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Lemmas/Variant62ce65fb0c8cf7b12eaa0cc48d362c0ac6f5e7b08ff8a531339b8bd8fccbe6b8.lean#L2380).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5bb2d722bba2a1af48bae7b7869bafe4599eeb43` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
