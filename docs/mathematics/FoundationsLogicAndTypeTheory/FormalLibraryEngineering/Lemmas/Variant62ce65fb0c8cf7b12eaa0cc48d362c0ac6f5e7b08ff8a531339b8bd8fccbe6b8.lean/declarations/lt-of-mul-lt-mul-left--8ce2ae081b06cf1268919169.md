## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fafa2d67-859d-b29e-643d-5e544a03e299`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1117–1126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lt_of_mul_lt_mul_left {a b c : Int} (w : a * b < a * c) (h : 0 ≤ a) : b < c := by
  rcases Int.lt_trichotomy b c with lt | rfl | gt
  · exact lt
  · exact False.elim (Int.lt_irrefl _ w)
  · rcases Int.lt_trichotomy a 0 with a_lt | rfl | a_gt
    · exact False.elim (Int.lt_irrefl _ (Int.lt_of_lt_of_le a_lt h))
    · exact False.elim (Int.lt_irrefl b (by simp at w))
    · have := le_of_mul_le_mul_left (Int.le_of_lt w) a_gt
      exact False.elim (Int.lt_irrefl _ (Int.lt_of_lt_of_le gt this))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Lemmas/Variant62ce65fb0c8cf7b12eaa0cc48d362c0ac6f5e7b08ff8a531339b8bd8fccbe6b8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Lemmas/Variant62ce65fb0c8cf7b12eaa0cc48d362c0ac6f5e7b08ff8a531339b8bd8fccbe6b8.lean#L1117).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5bb2d722bba2a1af48bae7b7869bafe4599eeb43` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
