## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d290f136197c36533878f2dc650dd089e47cbd7cd5b2b25b1d83e41c9191e2a1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 307–331.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
def Except.toTraceResult [ExceptToTraceResult ε α] (e : Except ε α) : TraceResult :=
  ExceptToTraceResult.toTraceResult e

open Lean

/-- Run the provided action `k`, and log its execution within a trace node.

The message is produced after the action completes, and has access to its return value.
If it is more convenient to produce the message as part of the computation,
then `Lean.withTraceNode'` can be used instead.
If profiling is enabled, this will also log the runtime of `k`.

The class `ExceptToTraceResult` is used to convert the result produced by `k` into a `TraceResult`
(success/failure/error), which is stored in `TraceData.result?`. The rendering layer uses
`TraceResult.toEmoji` to prepend the appropriate emoji (✅️/❌️/💥️) when displaying the trace.
A typical invocation might be:
```lean4
withTraceNode `isPosTrace
    (msg := fun _ => return m!"checking positivity") do
  return 0 < x
```

The `cls`, `collapsed`, and `tag` arguments are forwarded to the constructor of `TraceData`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Trace/Varianta49a604e68b3870755e1dd4f728fb5dc3a8dfcda43df53ae863786199e5fe167.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Trace/Varianta49a604e68b3870755e1dd4f728fb5dc3a8dfcda43df53ae863786199e5fe167.lean#L307).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4d441f69db37a760f7e9df53643c694e73b45713` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
