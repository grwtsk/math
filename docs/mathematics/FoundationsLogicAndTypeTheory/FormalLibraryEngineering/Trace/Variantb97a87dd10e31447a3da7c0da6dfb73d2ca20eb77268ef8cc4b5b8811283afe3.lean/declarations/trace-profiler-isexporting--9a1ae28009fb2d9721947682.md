## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f95ebca0f5e552970c2dce5a0cffb5f91279a3c5c88b5b1d8b79afb6e291da54`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 221–232.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[inline] def trace.profiler.isExporting (opts : Options) : Bool :=
  (trace.profiler.output.get? opts).isSome || trace.profiler.serve.get opts

register_builtin_option trace.profiler.output.pp : Bool := {
  defValue := false
  descr    :=
    "if false, limit text in exported trace nodes to trace class name and `TraceData.tag`, if any

This is useful when we are interested in the time taken by specific subsystems instead of specific \
invocations, which is the common case."
}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Trace/Variantb97a87dd10e31447a3da7c0da6dfb73d2ca20eb77268ef8cc4b5b8811283afe3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Trace/Variantb97a87dd10e31447a3da7c0da6dfb73d2ca20eb77268ef8cc4b5b8811283afe3.lean#L221).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cb6aea1431eef54da8295c675a31bcebb2ef16b2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
