## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1c0aa542ddba24251865cf32814d745d0db0bd4e5657418efbb12136307ba487`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 128–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public instance instLawfulOrderLT_ofOrd {α : Type u} [Ord α] [LE α] [LawfulOrderOrd α] :
    LawfulOrderLT α where
  lt_iff {a b} := by
    simp +contextual [LT.lt, ← Std.isLE_compare (a := a), ← Std.isGE_compare (a := a)]

attribute [local instance] BEq.ofOrd in
/--
The `BEq α` instance obtained from an `Ord α` instance is compatible with the `LE α` instance
instance if `Ord α` is compatible with it.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FactoriesExtra/Variant6e08ca9e5d4f166024c533d702bd86db1c6c137b63bed7efb19c7639fc7bed8c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FactoriesExtra/Variant6e08ca9e5d4f166024c533d702bd86db1c6c137b63bed7efb19c7639fc7bed8c.lean#L128).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a179b5d02d5671e3969076134f74434527132c1d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
