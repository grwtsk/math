## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dd26ae8038ea2f9a4b2df9d7de17bf1d5bfa01c3d9152a9947b8ed1f81f8b3cb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 465–485.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def addAnswer (cNode : ConsumerNode) : SynthM Unit := do
  withMCtx cNode.mctx do
  if cNode.size ≥ (← read).maxResultSize then
    trace[Meta.synthInstance.answer] "{crossEmoji} {← instantiateMVars (← inferType cNode.mvar)}{Format.line}(size: {cNode.size} ≥ {(← read).maxResultSize})"
  else
    withTraceNode `Meta.synthInstance.answer
      (fun _ => return m!"{← instantiateMVars (← inferType cNode.mvar)}") do
    let answer ← mkAnswer cNode
    -- Remark: `answer` does not contain assignable or assigned metavariables.
    let key := cNode.key
    let { waiters, answers } ← getEntry key
    if isNewAnswer answers answer then
      let newEntry := { waiters, answers := answers.push answer }
      modify fun s => { s with tableEntries := s.tableEntries.insert key newEntry }
      waiters.forM (wakeUp answer)

/--
  Return `true` if a type of the form `(a_1 : A_1) → ... → (a_n : A_n) → B` has an unused argument `a_i`.

  Remark: This is syntactic check and no reduction is performed.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SynthInstance/Variant1c4adf406c64523531b2af18073c2973cef5fe4eb80ac44bb9927d336559d004.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SynthInstance/Variant1c4adf406c64523531b2af18073c2973cef5fe4eb80ac44bb9927d336559d004.lean#L465).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `450d8edb60c648a3145eb1d9c2a410f4644debe1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
