## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9d055a3ef015eb1da73c768a38a73d875d97a20e2a91ef5486867555f105d71e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 943–957.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def cacheResult (cacheKey : SynthInstanceCacheKey) (kind : PreprocessKind) (abstResult? : Option AbstractMVarsResult) (result? : Option Expr) : MetaM Unit := do
  -- **TODO**: simplify this function.
  match abstResult? with
  | none => modify fun s => { s with cache.synthInstance := s.cache.synthInstance.insert cacheKey none }
  | some abstResult =>
    if abstResult.numMVars == 0 && abstResult.paramNames.isEmpty && kind matches .noMVars | .mvarsNoOutputParams then
      match result? with
      | none => modify fun s => { s with cache.synthInstance := s.cache.synthInstance.insert cacheKey none }
      | some result =>
        -- See `applyCachedAbstractResult?` If new metavariables have **not** been introduced,
        -- we don't need to perform extra checks again when reusing result.
        modify fun s => { s with cache.synthInstance := s.cache.synthInstance.insert cacheKey (some { expr := result, paramNames := #[], mvars := #[] }) }
    else
      modify fun s => { s with cache.synthInstance := s.cache.synthInstance.insert cacheKey (some abstResult) }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SynthInstance/Variant1c4adf406c64523531b2af18073c2973cef5fe4eb80ac44bb9927d336559d004.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SynthInstance/Variant1c4adf406c64523531b2af18073c2973cef5fe4eb80ac44bb9927d336559d004.lean#L943).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `450d8edb60c648a3145eb1d9c2a410f4644debe1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
