## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b2713b797cf265bdec8f00b1170f72b1d3ca24ba6cd8ecf0bea45cddc9503a14`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 461–472.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def mkAnswer (cNode : ConsumerNode) : MetaM Answer :=
  withMCtx cNode.mctx do
    let val ← instantiateMVars cNode.mvar
    trace[Meta.synthInstance.newAnswer] "size: {cNode.size}, val: {val}"
    let result ← abstractMVars val -- assignable metavariables become parameters
    let resultType ← inferType result.expr
    return { result, resultType, size := cNode.size + 1 }

/--
  Create a new answer after `cNode` resolved all subgoals.
  That is, `cNode.subgoals == []`.
  And then, store it in the tabled entries map, and wakeup waiters. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SynthInstance/Variant75943edea457557e1b3cc1a79e30a2a9bd3b768d8841d2145a299e90de9cc7d4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SynthInstance/Variant75943edea457557e1b3cc1a79e30a2a9bd3b768d8841d2145a299e90de9cc7d4.lean#L461).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e608408e1c1d850abed1de7230db8288ff187fd3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
