## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ce3783b4fe29b12b1b9969330a43312aaf831647ebdea93e1117625a7d02a3f1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1016–1021.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def synthInstance? (type : Expr) (maxResultSize? : Option Nat := none) : MetaM (Option Expr) := do profileitM Exception "typeclass inference" (← getOptions) (decl := type.getAppFn.constName?.getD .anonymous) do
  synthInstanceCore? type maxResultSize?

/--
  Return `LOption.some r` if succeeded, `LOption.none` if it failed, and `LOption.undef` if
  instance cannot be synthesized right now because `type` contains metavariables. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SynthInstance/Variant75943edea457557e1b3cc1a79e30a2a9bd3b768d8841d2145a299e90de9cc7d4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SynthInstance/Variant75943edea457557e1b3cc1a79e30a2a9bd3b768d8841d2145a299e90de9cc7d4.lean#L1016).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e608408e1c1d850abed1de7230db8288ff187fd3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
