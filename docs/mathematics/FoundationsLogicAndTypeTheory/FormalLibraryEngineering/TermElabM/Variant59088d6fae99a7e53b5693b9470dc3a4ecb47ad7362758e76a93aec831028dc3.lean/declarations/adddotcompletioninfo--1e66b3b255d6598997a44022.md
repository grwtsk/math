## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cfae030f24f7a1538af5fc1a256bea9c66170c81342a5764a2a05ccae9657875`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1867–1886.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def addDotCompletionInfo (stx : Syntax) (e : Expr) (expectedType? : Option Expr) : TermElabM Unit := do
  addCompletionInfo <| CompletionInfo.dot { expr := e, stx, lctx := (← getLCtx), elaborator := .anonymous, expectedType? } (expectedType? := expectedType?)

/--
  Main function for elaborating terms.
  It extracts the elaboration methods from the environment using the node kind.
  Recall that the environment has a mapping from `SyntaxNodeKind` to `TermElab` methods.
  It creates a fresh macro scope for executing the elaboration method.
  All unlogged trace messages produced by the elaboration method are logged using
  the position information at `stx`. If the elaboration method throws an `Exception.error` and `errToSorry == true`,
  the error is logged and a synthetic sorry expression is returned.
  If the elaboration throws `Exception.postpone` and `catchExPostpone == true`,
  a new synthetic metavariable of kind `SyntheticMVarKind.postponed` is created, registered,
  and returned.
  The option `catchExPostpone == false` is used to implement `resumeElabTerm`
  to prevent the creation of another synthetic metavariable when resuming the elaboration.

  If `implicitLambda == false`, then disable implicit lambdas feature for the given syntax, but not for its subterms.
  We use this flag to implement, for example, the `@` modifier. If `Context.implicitLambda == false`, then this parameter has no effect.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TermElabM/Variant59088d6fae99a7e53b5693b9470dc3a4ecb47ad7362758e76a93aec831028dc3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/TermElabM/Variant59088d6fae99a7e53b5693b9470dc3a4ecb47ad7362758e76a93aec831028dc3.lean#L1867).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `872babc942fe96b14ef803da94e7e2245f8a08ce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
