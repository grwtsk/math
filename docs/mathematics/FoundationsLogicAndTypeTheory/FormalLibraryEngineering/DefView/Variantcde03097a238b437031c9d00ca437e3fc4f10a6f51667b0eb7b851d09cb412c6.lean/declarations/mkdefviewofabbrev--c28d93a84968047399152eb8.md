## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d7e7debce6ce166cb893e3c8e06474a99748b7c6b59784da794566cb2ad44e25`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 140–147.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkDefViewOfAbbrev (modifiers : Modifiers) (stx : Syntax) : DefView :=
  -- leading_parser "abbrev " >> declId >> optDeclSig >> declVal
  let (binders, type) := expandOptDeclSig stx[2]
  let modifiers       := modifiers.addAttr { name := `inline }
  let modifiers       := modifiers.addAttr { name := `reducible }
  { ref := stx, headerRef := mkNullNode stx.getArgs[*...3], kind := DefKind.abbrev, modifiers,
    declId := stx[1], binders, type? := type, value := stx[3], docString? := modifiers.docString? }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DefView/Variantcde03097a238b437031c9d00ca437e3fc4f10a6f51667b0eb7b851d09cb412c6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DefView/Variantcde03097a238b437031c9d00ca437e3fc4f10a6f51667b0eb7b851d09cb412c6.lean#L140).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2257a4e77cfc1dda38427df20acc14147b394210` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
