## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:721828b66f24b7ac9098842e4b1d75d7adbbf35f087157f46fc19f603851768a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure CodeActionContext where
  /--
    An array of diagnostics known on the client side overlapping the range
    provided to the `textDocument/codeAction` request. They are provided so
    that the server knows which errors are currently presented to the user
    for the given range. There is no guarantee that these accurately reflect
    the error state of the resource. The primary parameter
    to compute code actions is the provided range.
  -/
  diagnostics : Array Diagnostic := #[]
  /-- Requested kind of actions to return.

    Actions not of this kind are filtered out by the client before being
    shown. So servers can omit computing them.
  -/
  only? : Option (Array CodeActionKind) := none
  /-- The reason why code actions were requested. -/
  triggerKind? : Option CodeActionTriggerKind := none
  deriving FromJson, ToJson

/-- Parameters for a [CodeActionRequest](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_codeAction). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CodeActions/Variantfd0408fa67b1680168ce911bb7d09c4bf12becbd7152c700f6d134003f48af13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/CodeActions/Variantfd0408fa67b1680168ce911bb7d09c4bf12becbd7152c700f6d134003f48af13.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4a19f51ba610750a956f80d7a9ee063651b90a24` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
