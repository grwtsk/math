## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cbe7edc64a9dda1596149772ab2e860b83c19f74f21b021c80bbcc8e268edcd9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 180–189.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public def getArtifact? [Bind m] [MonadLiftT BaseIO m] (descr : ArtifactDescr) : m (Option Artifact) :=
  getLakeCache >>= (·.getArtifact? descr)

/--
Returns whether the package should restore its artifacts from the Lake artifact cache.

If the package has not configured this option itself through
{lean}`Package.restoreAllArtifacts?`, this will default to the workspace configuration.
If not configured at all, this defaults to {lean}`false`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Monad/Variant52d0400be07bcd480d9216f35e848324bd5d2f32d3022d1f3d234eb99d3532f7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Monad/Variant52d0400be07bcd480d9216f35e848324bd5d2f32d3022d1f3d234eb99d3532f7.lean#L180).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d50bb193ecc6e855be6320efd26c0e05d8037c38` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
