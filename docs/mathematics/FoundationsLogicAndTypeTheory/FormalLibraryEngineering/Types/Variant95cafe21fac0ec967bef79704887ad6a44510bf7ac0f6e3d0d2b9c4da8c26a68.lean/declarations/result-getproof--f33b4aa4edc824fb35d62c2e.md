## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d4c896dccc6f4d6ce38fdaf4ff94dfa5b0d10f8e157d443c2818ae27efb83ec8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 577–588.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Result.getProof' (source : Expr) (r : Result) : MetaM Expr := do
  match r.proof? with
  | some p => return p
  | none   =>
    if (← isDefEq source r.expr) then
      mkEqRefl r.expr
    else
      /- `source` and `r.expr` must be definitionally equal, but
         are not definitionally equal at `TransparencyMode.reducible` -/
      mkExpectedTypeHint (← mkEqRefl r.expr) (← mkEq source r.expr)

/-- Construct the `Expr` `cast h e`, from a `Simp.Result` with proof `h`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Types/Variant95cafe21fac0ec967bef79704887ad6a44510bf7ac0f6e3d0d2b9c4da8c26a68.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Types/Variant95cafe21fac0ec967bef79704887ad6a44510bf7ac0f6e3d0d2b9c4da8c26a68.lean#L577).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `72d40477938cad4453b8a9ed0ed7776e52964f22` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
