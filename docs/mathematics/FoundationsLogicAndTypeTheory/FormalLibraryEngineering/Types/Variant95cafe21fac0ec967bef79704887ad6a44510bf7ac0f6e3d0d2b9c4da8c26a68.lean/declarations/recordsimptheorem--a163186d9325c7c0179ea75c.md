## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:11b005aeb779b4cc017865ad576831828d9eeaf3c1e7e1d186351fa6708fd6d2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 534–554.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def recordSimpTheorem (thmId : Origin) : SimpM Unit := do
  modifyDiag fun s =>
    let cNew := if let some c := s.usedThmCounter.find? thmId then c + 1 else 1
    { s with usedThmCounter := s.usedThmCounter.insert thmId cNew }
  /-
  If `thmId` is an equational theorem (e.g., `foo.eq_1`), we should record `foo` instead.
  See issue #3547.
  -/
  let thmId ← match thmId with
    | .decl declName post false =>
      /-
      Remark: if `inv := true`, then the user has manually provided the theorem and wants to
      use it in the reverse direction. So, we only performs the substitution when `inv := false`
      -/
      if let some declName ← isEqnThm? declName then
        pure (Origin.decl declName post false)
      else
        pure thmId
    | _ => pure thmId
  modify fun s => { s with usedTheorems := s.usedTheorems.insert thmId }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Types/Variant95cafe21fac0ec967bef79704887ad6a44510bf7ac0f6e3d0d2b9c4da8c26a68.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Types/Variant95cafe21fac0ec967bef79704887ad6a44510bf7ac0f6e3d0d2b9c4da8c26a68.lean#L534).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `72d40477938cad4453b8a9ed0ed7776e52964f22` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
