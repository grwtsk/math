## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d058264c547857b7d614771ce181e9e7d29240768932085e1268a9e541dec997`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 952–962.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Result.addForalls (r : Result) (xs : Array Expr) : MetaM Result := do
  if xs.isEmpty then return r
  let eNew ← mkForallFVars xs r.expr
  match r.proof? with
  | none   => return { expr := eNew }
  | some h =>
    let p ← xs.foldrM (init := h) fun x h => do
      mkForallCongr (← mkLambdaFVars #[x] h)
    return { expr := eNew, proof? := p }


```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Types/Variante2b51b0c728cc1143aab68d9a58a5a1cf8420f4a9f11d3012584fe7a84f143c5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Types/Variante2b51b0c728cc1143aab68d9a58a5a1cf8420f4a9f11d3012584fe7a84f143c5.lean#L952).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `478b7f82f24f885dac2cb1113f049505ee5d7b8d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
