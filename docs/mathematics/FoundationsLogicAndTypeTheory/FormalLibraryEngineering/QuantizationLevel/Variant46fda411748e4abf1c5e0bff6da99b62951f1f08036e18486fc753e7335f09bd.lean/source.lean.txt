# Positive finite quantization levels

`Surface.Quantization.ResolutionBits` supplies the neutral representation
carrier. This module adds assurance-owned encoding, overflow, and rounding
policies without redefining that carrier.

The policy enumerations below describe representation choices.  At present
only bit planes have a formal implementation; registering bounded words does
not manufacture an implementation or an equivalence with bit planes.
