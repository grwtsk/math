## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c3ec8d976942c516c6494bfd128adc0236233e96da1805e44d3dd4cdbf020699`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 51–62.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def fixAux {p : ℕ → Prop} (i : Nat.Upto p) (g : ∀ j : Nat.Upto p, i < j → ∀ a, Part (β a)) :
    ∀ a, Part (β a) :=
  f fun x : α => (assert ¬p i.val) fun h : ¬p i.val => g (i.succ h) (Nat.lt_succ_self _) x

/-- The least fixed point of `f`.

If `f` is a continuous function (according to complete partial orders),
it satisfies the equations:

  1. `fix f = f (fix f)`          (is a fixed point)
  2. `∀ X, f X ≤ X → fix f ≤ X`   (least fixed point)
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Fix/Variant1c6d323505db8d1fb89b13baf78238977aab59667c034a379dc81f5432c741cb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Fix/Variant1c6d323505db8d1fb89b13baf78238977aab59667c034a379dc81f5432c741cb.lean#L51).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b0e0195ddc05657284d307a3f3c8d967e8e37de1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
