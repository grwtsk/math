## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1689645bbf0b4d070b163ed6e151467f017003b0d3239847956af143e7efc4ec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 247–257.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def groupGoalsByFunction (argsPacker : ArgsPacker) (numFuncs : Nat) (goals : Array MVarId) : MetaM (Array (Array MVarId)) := do
  let mut r := .replicate numFuncs #[]
  for goal in goals do
    let type ← goal.getType
    let (.mdata _ (.app _ param)) := type
        | throwError "MVar does not look like a recursive call:{indentExpr type}"
    let some (funidx, _) := argsPacker.unpack param
        | throwError "Cannot unpack param, unexpected expression:{indentExpr param}"
    r := r.modify funidx (·.push goal)
  return r

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Fix/Variant4b4bbab7245c1185f5971be4a632240acb69dcb8623fe829d545550268f55c94.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Fix/Variant4b4bbab7245c1185f5971be4a632240acb69dcb8623fe829d545550268f55c94.lean#L247).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `21aa83fd323f9a3d86ab7141429a8685d10abc0e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
