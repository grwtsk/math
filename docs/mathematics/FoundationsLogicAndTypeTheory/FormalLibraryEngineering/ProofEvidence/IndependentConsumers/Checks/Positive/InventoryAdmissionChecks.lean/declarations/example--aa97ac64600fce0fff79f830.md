## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e194130164780e74a5ee6024dd38ae017bef70cbe95432a1ab68fc0652ea3e5b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 112–122.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example (objects : List Bytes) (sets : List ReadSet)
    (raw : List CertificateProducer.RawRoute) (prepared : List Binding)
    (placeholders : List String) (empty : Nat) (result : CertificateProducer.Produced)
    (produced : CertificateProducer.produce objects sets raw prepared placeholders empty = some result) :
    result.occurrences.map Occurrence.binding = CertificateProducer.routeBindings raw prepared ∧
      result.occurrences.length = raw.length + prepared.length ∧
      (result.outputs.map CertificateProducer.outputKey).Nodup :=
  ⟨CertificateProducer.produced_occurrence_order produced,
    CertificateProducer.produced_occurrence_count produced,
    CertificateProducer.produced_output_keys_unique produced⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ProofEvidence/IndependentConsumers/Checks/Positive/InventoryAdmissionChecks.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ProofEvidence/IndependentConsumers/Checks/Positive/InventoryAdmissionChecks.lean#L112).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `24bb0e8a20a6385fa4cc0d9ab574fa5ff37aac33` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
