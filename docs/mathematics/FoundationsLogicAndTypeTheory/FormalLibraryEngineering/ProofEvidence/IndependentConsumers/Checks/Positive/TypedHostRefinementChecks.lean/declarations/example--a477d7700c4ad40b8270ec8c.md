## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b92de83b72667186eac751bfbf2f21846cb724437b2094bfd35f2a7e161d5a77`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 959–970.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example (plan : Plan) (area : Area) (records : Files Record)
    (objects : LiteralLengthBounds.Objects) (slots : LiteralLengthBounds.Slots)
    (files : Files LiteralLengthBounds.Payload) (archive : unique plan.archive)
    (slotUnique : unique slots)
    (success : TransactionConstruction.constructFiles plan area = .ok records)
    (lengths : LiteralLengthBounds.recordsMatch objects records slots = true)
    (decoded : LiteralLengthBounds.decodeSlots objects slots = some files) :
    files.length ≤ PlanResources.maxFiles ∧
      (files.map fun row => row.2.length).sum ≤ PlanResources.maxTotalBytes :=
  TransactionConstruction.constructFiles_decoded_literal_bounds plan area records objects slots files
    archive slotUnique success lengths decoded

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ProofEvidence/IndependentConsumers/Checks/Positive/TypedHostRefinementChecks.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ProofEvidence/IndependentConsumers/Checks/Positive/TypedHostRefinementChecks.lean#L959).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7de2609e869fe0a44561663d5984663f60ebc8b0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
