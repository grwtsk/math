## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:027cc02a7c0626423529df2bc7dcecb42d26a6dec681405bcbbd488990f7d3f8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 75–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Poly.add (p₁ p₂ : Poly) : Poly :=
  go hugeFuel p₁ p₂
where
  go (fuel : Nat) (p₁ p₂ : Poly) : Poly :=
    match fuel with
    | 0 => p₁ ++ p₂
    | fuel + 1 =>
      match p₁, p₂ with
      | p₁, [] => p₁
      | [], p₂ => p₂
      | (k₁, m₁) :: p₁, (k₂, m₂) :: p₂ =>
        bif m₁ < m₂ then
          (k₁, m₁) :: go fuel p₁ ((k₂, m₂) :: p₂)
        else bif m₂ < m₁ then
          (k₂, m₂) :: go fuel ((k₁, m₁) :: p₁) p₂
        else bif k₁ + k₂ == 0 then
          go fuel p₁ p₂
        else
          (k₁ + k₂, m₁) :: go fuel p₁ p₂

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SOM/Variant8fdbe68bd6d0f400a0ac9d1334f49abd51d21da1265d127c034b99d40df706f4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SOM/Variant8fdbe68bd6d0f400a0ac9d1334f49abd51d21da1265d127c034b99d40df706f4.lean#L75).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `706a16bccf9cf885f3aecdf20f96d46284bc4169` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
