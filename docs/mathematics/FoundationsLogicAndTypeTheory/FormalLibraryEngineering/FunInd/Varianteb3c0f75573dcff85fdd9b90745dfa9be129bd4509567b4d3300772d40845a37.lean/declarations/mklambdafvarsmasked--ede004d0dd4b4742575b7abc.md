## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d40ca613248d8b9b2ef5b07dd90a18df812ec77939a5007a0cbbfb7d46c789fc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 539–557.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkLambdaFVarsMasked (xs : Array Expr) (e : Expr) : MetaM (Array Bool × Expr) := do
  let mut e := e
  let mut xs := xs
  let mut mask := #[]
  while ! xs.isEmpty do
    let discr := xs.back!
    xs := xs.pop
    if discr.isFVar && e.containsFVar discr.fvarId! then
      unless (← discr.fvarId!.isLetVar) do
        e ← mkLambdaFVars #[discr] e
        mask := mask.push true
        continue
    mask := mask.push false
  return (mask.reverse, e)

/--
Applies `rw` to `goal`, passes the rewritten `goal'` to `k` (which should return an expression of
type `goal'`), and wraps that using the proof from `rw`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FunInd/Varianteb3c0f75573dcff85fdd9b90745dfa9be129bd4509567b4d3300772d40845a37.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/FunInd/Varianteb3c0f75573dcff85fdd9b90745dfa9be129bd4509567b4d3300772d40845a37.lean#L539).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `20587c35412e3313846c39603df036e01503a5eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
