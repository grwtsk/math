## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:76872e8f13458b35d3fca1cb88805be91b2f6c3322692773e6e3e845ea6b7170`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 706–727.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def propagateAndUp (e : Expr) : CCM Unit := do
  let some (a, b) := e.and? | failure
  if ← isEqTrue a then
    -- `a = True  → (And a b) = b`
    pushEq e b (mkApp3 (.const ``and_eq_of_eq_true_left []) a b (← getEqTrueProof a))
  else if ← isEqTrue b then
    -- `b = True  → (And a b) = a`
    pushEq e a (mkApp3 (.const ``and_eq_of_eq_true_right []) a b (← getEqTrueProof b))
  else if ← isEqFalse a then
    -- `a = False → (And a b) = False`
    pushEq e (.const ``False [])
      (mkApp3 (.const ``and_eq_of_eq_false_left []) a b (← getEqFalseProof a))
  else if ← isEqFalse b then
    -- `b = False → (And a b) = False`
    pushEq e (.const ``False [])
      (mkApp3 (.const ``and_eq_of_eq_false_right []) a b (← getEqFalseProof b))
  else if ← isEqv a b then
    -- `a = b     → (And a b) = a`
    pushEq e a (mkApp3 (.const ``and_eq_of_eq []) a b (← getPropEqProof a b))
  -- We may also add `a = Not b -> (And a b) = False`

/-- Propagate equality from `a` and `b` to `a ∨ b`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Addition/Variant6511a0a10444c671904c3b880f2417a88fbf49a3ac503a6b2986bafd5774a8cd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Addition/Variant6511a0a10444c671904c3b880f2417a88fbf49a3ac503a6b2986bafd5774a8cd.lean#L706).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `54d943aebbad215d727cdaf18f258cb43887aea0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
