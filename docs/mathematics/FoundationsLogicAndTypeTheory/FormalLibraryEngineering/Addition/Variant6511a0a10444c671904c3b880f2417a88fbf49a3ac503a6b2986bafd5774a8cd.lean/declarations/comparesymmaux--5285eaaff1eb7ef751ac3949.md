## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:add284783ad1517a2ef2ea254ae2bc15ea7c3ef2d30d2c1e63c85902287beb96`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 104–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def compareSymmAux (lhs₁ rhs₁ lhs₂ rhs₂ : Expr) : CCM Bool := do
  let lhs₁ ← getRoot lhs₁
  let rhs₁ ← getRoot rhs₁
  let lhs₂ ← getRoot lhs₂
  let rhs₂ ← getRoot rhs₂
  let (lhs₁, rhs₁) := if rhs₁.lt lhs₁ then (rhs₁, lhs₁) else (lhs₁, rhs₁)
  let (lhs₂, rhs₂) := if rhs₂.lt lhs₂ then (rhs₂, lhs₂) else (lhs₂, rhs₂)
  return lhs₁ == lhs₂ && rhs₁ == rhs₂

/-- Given ``k₁ := (R₁ lhs₁ rhs₁, `R₁)`` and ``k₂ := (R₂ lhs₂ rhs₂, `R₂)``, return `true` if
`R₁ lhs₁ rhs₁` is equivalent to `R₂ lhs₂ rhs₂` modulo the symmetry of `R₁` and `R₂`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Addition/Variant6511a0a10444c671904c3b880f2417a88fbf49a3ac503a6b2986bafd5774a8cd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Addition/Variant6511a0a10444c671904c3b880f2417a88fbf49a3ac503a6b2986bafd5774a8cd.lean#L104).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `54d943aebbad215d727cdaf18f258cb43887aea0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
