## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:41d97136ab63b13420e6135b663062edbebd0952f62096eac486d6aa50bd8359`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 233–248.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getEqcLambdas (e : Expr) (r : Array Expr := #[]) : CCM (Array Expr) := do
  guard ((← getRoot e) == e)
  let mut r := r
  let some ee ← getEntry e | failure
  unless ee.hasLambdas do return r
  let mut it := e
  repeat
    if it.isLambda then
      r := r.push it
    let some itN ← getEntry it | failure
    it := itN.next
  until it == e
  return r

/-- Remove `fn` and expressions whose type isn't def-eq to `fn`'s type out from `lambdas`,
return the remaining lambdas applied to the reversed arguments. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Addition/Variant902778e6fd8294f44c0167500dcbf3b6fd60a27378024c3d3ffaf1b68640f7de.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Addition/Variant902778e6fd8294f44c0167500dcbf3b6fd60a27378024c3d3ffaf1b68640f7de.lean#L233).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cab91cdf92ef91ceb61392d33d99236b369fae4e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
