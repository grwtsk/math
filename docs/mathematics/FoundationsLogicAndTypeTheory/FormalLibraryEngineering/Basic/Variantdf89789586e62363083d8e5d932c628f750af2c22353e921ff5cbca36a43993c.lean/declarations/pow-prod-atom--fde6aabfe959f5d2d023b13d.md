## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a8bdf29a-d15d-1538-3af9-b873d788d4e3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 596–604.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pow_prod_atom (a : R) (b) : a ^ b = (a + 0) ^ b * (nat_lit 1).rawCast := by simp

/--
The fallback case for exponentiating polynomials is to use `ExBase.toProd` to just build an
exponent expression. (This has a slightly different normalization than `evalPowAtom` because
the input types are different.)

* `x ^ e = (x + 0) ^ e * 1`
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variantdf89789586e62363083d8e5d932c628f750af2c22353e921ff5cbca36a43993c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variantdf89789586e62363083d8e5d932c628f750af2c22353e921ff5cbca36a43993c.lean#L596).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bcfd61f1f8dda3cfa20a73d9fc468d73c06e288d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
