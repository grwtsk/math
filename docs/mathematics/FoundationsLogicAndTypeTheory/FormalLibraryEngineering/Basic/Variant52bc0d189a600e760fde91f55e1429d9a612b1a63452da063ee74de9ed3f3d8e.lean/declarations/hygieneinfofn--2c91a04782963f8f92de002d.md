## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:02c5f81423cec0c61112a3773de25621627bdbd0ef3839be65120ad492f91c75`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1322–1345.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def hygieneInfoFn : ParserFn := fun c s => Id.run do
  let finish pos str trailing s :=
    -- Builds an actual hygieneInfo node from empty string `str` and trailing whitespace `trailing`.
    let info  := SourceInfo.original str pos trailing pos
    let ident := mkIdent info str .anonymous
    let stx   := mkNode hygieneInfoKind #[ident]
    s.pushSyntax stx
  -- If we are at the whitespace after a token, the last item on the stack
  -- will have trailing whitespace. We want to position this hygieneInfo
  -- item immediately after the last token, and reattribute the trailing whitespace
  -- to the hygieneInfo node itself. This allows combinators like `ws` to
  -- be unaffected by `hygieneInfo` parsers before or after, see `2262.lean`.
  if !s.stxStack.isEmpty then
    let prev := s.stxStack.back
    if let .original leading pos trailing endPos := prev.getTailInfo then
      let str := c.mkEmptySubstringAt endPos
      -- steal the trailing whitespace from the last node and use it for this node
      let s := s.popSyntax.pushSyntax <| prev.setTailInfo (.original leading pos str endPos)
      return finish endPos str trailing s
  -- The stack can be empty if this is either the first token, or if we are in a fresh cache.
  -- In that case we just put the hygieneInfo at the current location.
  let str := c.mkEmptySubstringAt s.pos
  finish s.pos str str s

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant52bc0d189a600e760fde91f55e1429d9a612b1a63452da063ee74de9ed3f3d8e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant52bc0d189a600e760fde91f55e1429d9a612b1a63452da063ee74de9ed3f3d8e.lean#L1322).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3825f827390f270667bcd7bdc0b5f9c353867a36` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
