## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9fdf073645a71a62a9aaa790399f7b80822ae64ad40ec1d3fdf253e47bd755bb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1466–1479.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def checkColEqFn (errorMsg : String) : ParserFn := fun c s =>
  match c.savedPos? with
  | none => s
  | some savedPos =>
    let savedPos := c.fileMap.toPosition savedPos
    let pos      := c.fileMap.toPosition s.pos
    if pos.column = savedPos.column then s
    else s.mkError errorMsg

/-- The `colEq` parser ensures that the next token starts at exactly the column of the saved
position (see `withPosition`). This can be used to do whitespace sensitive syntax like
a `by` block or `do` block, where all the lines have to line up.

This parser has arity 0 - it does not capture anything. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant52bc0d189a600e760fde91f55e1429d9a612b1a63452da063ee74de9ed3f3d8e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant52bc0d189a600e760fde91f55e1429d9a612b1a63452da063ee74de9ed3f3d8e.lean#L1466).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3825f827390f270667bcd7bdc0b5f9c353867a36` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
