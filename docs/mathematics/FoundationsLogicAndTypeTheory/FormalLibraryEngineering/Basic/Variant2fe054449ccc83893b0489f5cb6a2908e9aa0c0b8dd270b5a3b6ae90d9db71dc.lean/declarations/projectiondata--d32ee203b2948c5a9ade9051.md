## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:96b279170aac90b8deb9b961b3b43b83c93bdbf92c60e27ad9395ba9d005a808`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 364–384.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ProjectionData where
  /-- The name used in the generated `simp` lemmas -/
  name : Name
  /-- An Expression used by simps for the projection. It must be definitionally equal to an original
  projection (or a composition of multiple projections).
  These Expressions can contain the universe parameters specified in the first argument of
  `structureExt`. -/
  expr : Expr
  /-- A list of natural numbers, which is the projection number(s) that have to be applied to the
  Expression. For example the list `[0, 1]` corresponds to applying the first projection of the
  structure, and then the second projection of the resulting structure (this assumes that the
  target of the first projection is a structure with at least two projections).
  The composition of these projections is required to be definitionally equal to the provided
  Expression. -/
  projNrs : List Nat
  /-- A boolean specifying whether `simp` lemmas are generated for this projection by default. -/
  isDefault : Bool
  /-- A boolean specifying whether this projection is written as prefix. -/
  isPrefix : Bool
  deriving Inhabited

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2fe054449ccc83893b0489f5cb6a2908e9aa0c0b8dd270b5a3b6ae90d9db71dc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2fe054449ccc83893b0489f5cb6a2908e9aa0c0b8dd270b5a3b6ae90d9db71dc.lean#L364).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `897dc165e21c4f9ccbb731a2d0042e16e883e74b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
