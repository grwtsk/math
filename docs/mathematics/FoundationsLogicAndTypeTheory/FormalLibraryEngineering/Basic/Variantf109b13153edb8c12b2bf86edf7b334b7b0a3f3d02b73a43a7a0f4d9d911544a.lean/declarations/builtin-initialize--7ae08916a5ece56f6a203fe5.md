## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `builtin_initialize` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:237d0f8901096d76d2107d966ab8c7f66c5f675613c6fccb6ef4372eb559b07b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 112–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
unsafe builtin_initialize delabAttribute : KeyedDeclsAttribute Delab ←
  KeyedDeclsAttribute.init {
    builtinName := `builtin_delab,
    name := `delab,
    descr    := "Register a delaborator",
    valueTypeName := `Lean.PrettyPrinter.Delaborator.Delab
    evalKey := fun _ stx => do
      let stx ← Attribute.Builtin.getIdent stx
      let kind := stx.getId
      if (← Elab.getInfoState).enabled && kind.getRoot == `app then
        let c := kind.replacePrefix `app .anonymous
        if (← getEnv).contains c then
          recordExtraModUseFromDecl (isMeta := false) c
          Elab.addConstInfo stx c none
      pure kind
  }

/--
`@[app_delab c]` registers a delaborator for applications with head constant `c`.
Such delaborators also apply to the constant `c` itself (known as a "nullary application").

This attribute should be applied to definitions of type `Lean.PrettyPrinter.Delaborator.Delab`.

When defining delaborators for constant applications, one should prefer this attribute over `@[delab app.c]`,
as `@[app_delab c]` first performs name resolution on `c` in the current scope.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variantf109b13153edb8c12b2bf86edf7b334b7b0a3f3d02b73a43a7a0f4d9d911544a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variantf109b13153edb8c12b2bf86edf7b334b7b0a3f3d02b73a43a7a0f4d9d911544a.lean#L112).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `291d618e54e6b8ae7671e551b11d113825336ce1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
