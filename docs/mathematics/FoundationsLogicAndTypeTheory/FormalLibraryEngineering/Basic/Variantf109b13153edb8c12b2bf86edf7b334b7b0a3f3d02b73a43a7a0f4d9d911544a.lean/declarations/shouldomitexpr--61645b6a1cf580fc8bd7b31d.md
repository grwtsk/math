## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0cfa97e5581c9728d1c574cab123611c177098fdd7b9240fe4a0fd7f8f8fe1e8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 382–406.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def shouldOmitExpr (e : Expr) : DelabM Bool := do
  -- Atomic expressions never get omitted, so we can do an early return here.
  if e.isAtomic then
    return false

  if (← getPPOption getPPDeepTerms) then
    return false

  let depth := (← read).depth
  let depthThreshold ← getPPOption getPPDeepTermsThreshold
  let depthExcess := depth - depthThreshold
  -- This threshold for shallow expressions effectively allows full terms to be pretty printed 25% deeper,
  -- so long as the subterm actually can be fully pretty printed within this extra 25% depth.
  let threshold := depthThreshold/4 - depthExcess

  return depthExcess > 0 && !isShallowExpression threshold e

/--
Returns `true` if the given expression is a proof and should be omitted.
This function only returns `true` if `pp.proofs` is set to `false`.

"Shallow" proofs are not omitted.
The `pp.proofs.threshold` option controls the depth threshold for what constitutes a shallow proof.
See `Lean.PrettyPrinter.Delaborator.isShallowExpression`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variantf109b13153edb8c12b2bf86edf7b334b7b0a3f3d02b73a43a7a0f4d9d911544a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variantf109b13153edb8c12b2bf86edf7b334b7b0a3f3d02b73a43a7a0f4d9d911544a.lean#L382).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `291d618e54e6b8ae7671e551b11d113825336ce1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
