## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:782a70f98fd9a98f2d47875603940b7f1625abbcf680ac6514ea34d5d1fc7b34`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 31–47.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def factorial : ℕ → ℕ
  | 0 => 1
  | succ n => succ n * factorial n

/-- factorial notation `(n)!` for `Nat.factorial n`.
In Lean, names can end with exclamation marks (e.g. `List.get!`), so you cannot write
`n!` in Lean, but must write `(n)!` or `n !` instead. The former is preferred, since
Lean can confuse the `!` in `n !` as the (prefix) boolean negation operation in some
cases.
For numerals the parentheses are not required, so e.g. `0!` or `1!` work fine.
Todo: replace occurrences of `n !` with `(n)!` in Mathlib. -/
scoped notation:10000 n "!" => Nat.factorial n

section Factorial

variable {m n : ℕ}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant08675052c5857f6ab4c732aa921dbbe95ec9ae82089550b6e3f6863e327a6b94.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant08675052c5857f6ab4c732aa921dbbe95ec9ae82089550b6e3f6863e327a6b94.lean#L31).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `40d6c2b5c194440265719b8c55a4c76d8cec7f86` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
