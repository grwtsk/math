## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f6f6e54d163c743f14775989e5e7bd7505dd2812dbeb5773441f20fb0b30be07`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 104–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def containsThenInsertIfNew [EquivBEq α] [LawfulHashable α]
    (m : ExtHashMap α β) (a : α) (b : β) : Bool × ExtHashMap α β :=
  let ⟨replaced, r⟩ := m.inner.containsThenInsertIfNew a b
  ⟨replaced, ⟨r⟩⟩

/--
Checks whether a key is present in a map, returning the associated value, and inserts a value for
the key if it was not found.

If the returned value is `some v`, then the returned map is unaltered. If it is `none`, then the
returned map has a new value inserted.

Equivalent to (but potentially faster than) calling `get?` followed by `insertIfNew`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant7fd6ba490503b0a8fdb9ffa202343ec0af14a03fe2760f026104a48b82a88966.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant7fd6ba490503b0a8fdb9ffa202343ec0af14a03fe2760f026104a48b82a88966.lean#L104).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0295cf8fd7115c46ab3efcb09960b2c71db767f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
