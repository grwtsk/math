## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9afe5998-9c58-5bd9-6c4b-ecd8946b1579`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 264–273.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem CommApplicative.commutative_map {m : Type u → Type v} [h : Applicative m]
    [CommApplicative m] {α β γ} (a : m α) (b : m β) {f : α → β → γ} :
  f <$> a <*> b = flip f <$> b <*> a :=
  calc
    f <$> a <*> b = (fun p : α × β => f p.1 p.2) <$> (Prod.mk <$> a <*> b) := by
      simp [seq_map_assoc, map_seq, seq_assoc, seq_pure, map_map]; rfl
    _ = (fun b a => f a b) <$> b <*> a := by
      rw [@CommApplicative.commutative_prod m h]
      simp [seq_map_assoc, map_seq, seq_assoc, seq_pure, map_map, (· ∘ ·)]
#align is_comm_applicative.commutative_map CommApplicative.commutative_map
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Varianted41dda55112485b5178eb351bcf7bdd9f20293725f5fa11e32824c9866835c3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Varianted41dda55112485b5178eb351bcf7bdd9f20293725f5fa11e32824c9866835c3.lean#L264).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `02f42741c26073df55f9f8ff486fa07f0e69e9f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
