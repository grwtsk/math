## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3717bd975c22e7a3d9b988794f88706e655c6e1d63924ed2e207f2f1761fb350`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 80–100.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class IntModule (M : Type u) extends AddCommGroup M where
  /-- Scalar multiplication by natural numbers. -/
  [nsmul : SMul Nat M]
  /-- Scalar multiplication by integers. -/
  [zsmul : SMul Int M]
  /-- Scalar multiplication by zero is zero. -/
  zero_zsmul : ∀ a : M, (0 : Int) • a = 0
  /-- Scalar multiplication by one is the identity. -/
  one_zsmul : ∀ a : M, (1 : Int) • a = a
  /-- Scalar multiplication is distributive over addition in the integers. -/
  add_zsmul : ∀ n m : Int, ∀ a : M, (n + m) • a = n • a + m • a
  /-- Scalar multiplication by natural numbers is consistent with scalar multiplication by integers. -/
  zsmul_natCast_eq_nsmul : ∀ n : Nat, ∀ a : M, (n : Int) • a = n • a

attribute [instance_reducible] IntModule.zsmul
attribute [instance 100] IntModule.toAddCommGroup IntModule.zsmul

namespace IntModule

variable {M : Type u} [IntModule M]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant605574d27639d9dd98bf365a52b51cad875a29242abc742eb83e3b2d96685ea9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant605574d27639d9dd98bf365a52b51cad875a29242abc742eb83e3b2d96685ea9.lean#L80).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b1ed048c129db011ca964d998214bbf59c6eaba6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
