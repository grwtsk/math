## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f68450f2d1027c5b8d4a8df006e517582960ec5187d8a2cbcbbd8e369da410ce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 451–463.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive ProjectionRule where
  /-- A renaming rule `before→after` or
    Each name comes with the syntax used to write the rule,
    which is used to declare hover information. -/
  | rename (oldName : Name) (oldStx : Syntax) (newName : Name) (newStx : Syntax) :
      ProjectionRule
  /-- An adding rule `+fieldName` -/
  | add : Name → Syntax → ProjectionRule
  /-- A hiding rule `-fieldName` -/
  | erase : Name → Syntax → ProjectionRule
  /-- A prefix rule `prefix fieldName` -/
  | prefix : Name → Syntax → ProjectionRule

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variantdd4e666e3ca08122c0e7e41278fa5e49a15b1a2aa9c3ede251b8bdfa212ca063.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variantdd4e666e3ca08122c0e7e41278fa5e49a15b1a2aa9c3ede251b8bdfa212ca063.lean#L451).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0479e1e84fa7c9d53b5dcb94336ad6f7962f01fb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
