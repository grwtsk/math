## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:583e5e51b274b77c9ef9ba7e7592390edd85c8235eacde1cbd2be2728cbe2f48`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 228–241.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def strictImplicitRightBracket := atomic (group (symbol "}" >> "}")) <|> "⦄"
/--
Strict-implicit binder, like `⦃x y : A⦄` or `⦃x y⦄`.
In contrast to `{ ... }` implicit binders, strict-implicit binders do not automatically insert
a `_` placeholder until at least one subsequent explicit parameter is specified.
Do *not* use strict-implicit binders unless there is a subsequent explicit parameter.
Assuming this rule is followed, for fully applied expressions implicit and strict-implicit binders have the same behavior.

Example: If `h : ∀ ⦃x : A⦄, x ∈ s → p x` and `hs : y ∈ s`,
then `h` by itself elaborates to itself without inserting `_` for the `x : A` parameter,
and `h hs` has type `p y`.
In contrast, if `h' : ∀ {x : A}, x ∈ s → p x`, then `h` by itself elaborates to have type `?m ∈ s → p ?m`
with `?m` a fresh metavariable.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant7b9b00d80d97311a51e6226a40e6bed5aead09e300a042b0506479f87f4632b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant7b9b00d80d97311a51e6226a40e6bed5aead09e300a042b0506479f87f4632b9.lean#L228).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `19b3938e9d6ae22e59c5ffc3d1977c9ead18d505` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
