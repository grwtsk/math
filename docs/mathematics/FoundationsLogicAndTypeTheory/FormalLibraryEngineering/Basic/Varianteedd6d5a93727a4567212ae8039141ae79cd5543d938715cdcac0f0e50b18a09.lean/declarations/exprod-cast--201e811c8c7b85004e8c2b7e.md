## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:191723a9df5c911580b722eb6dcc37ba09e5687adc65cd71eefdafad5cd197f1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 223–229.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def ExProd.cast
    {v : Lean.Level} {β : Q(Type v)} {sβ : Q(CommSemiring $β)} {a : Q($α)} :
    ExProd sα a → Σ a, ExProd sβ a
  | .const i h => ⟨a, .const i h⟩
  | .mul a₁ a₂ a₃ => ⟨_, .mul a₁.cast.2 a₂ a₃.cast.2⟩

/-- Converts `ExSum sα` to `ExSum sβ`, assuming `sα` and `sβ` are defeq. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Varianteedd6d5a93727a4567212ae8039141ae79cd5543d938715cdcac0f0e50b18a09.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Varianteedd6d5a93727a4567212ae8039141ae79cd5543d938715cdcac0f0e50b18a09.lean#L223).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `199b4667a30b01ece8856acfe3e52a15791e68aa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
