## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5761baf2805750e178e6906cc5318492a1226e7522dd0e0a0a09f2bf66493a8f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 30–48.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IterM.inductSteps {α m β} [Iterator α m β] [Finite α m]
  (motive : IterM (α := α) m β → Sort x)
  (step : (it : IterM (α := α) m β) →
    (ih_yield : ∀ {it' : IterM (α := α) m β} {out : β},
      it.IsPlausibleStep (.yield it' out) → motive it') →
    (ih_skip : ∀ {it' : IterM (α := α) m β}, it.IsPlausibleStep (.skip it') → motive it') →
    motive it)
  (it : IterM (α := α) m β) : motive it :=
  step it
    (fun {it' _} _ => inductSteps motive step it')
    (fun {it'} _ => inductSteps motive step it')
termination_by it.finitelyManySteps

/--
Induction principle for productive monadic iterators: One can define a function `f` that maps every
iterator `it` to an element of `motive it` by defining `f it` in terms of the values of `f` on
the plausible skip successors of `it'.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2257219a26cef63f494fae297262fe032760cf7777bb6dc4c7f88639bb8f277c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2257219a26cef63f494fae297262fe032760cf7777bb6dc4c7f88639bb8f277c.lean#L30).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `722ea0d61e7cdadcc9a14a64513724ef68e8f233` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
