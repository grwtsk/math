## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cc39e79d3661c4e6c7de47f96c5325d838295b3370416906a4ad8629c21be917`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1034–1039.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def evalDiv {a b : Q($α)} (rα : Q(DivisionRing $α)) (czα : Option Q(CharZero $α)) (va : ExSum sα a)
    (vb : ExSum sα b) : AtomM (Result (ExSum sα) q($a / $b)) := do
  let ⟨_c, vc, pc⟩ ← vb.evalInv sα rα czα
  let ⟨d, vd, (pd : Q($a * $_c = $d))⟩ ← evalMul sα va vc
  pure ⟨d, vd, q(div_pf $pc $pd)⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant1add6dac4afd3d5b1395bb8da86d5bf074e69e5a13f909194999c0989dabe967.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant1add6dac4afd3d5b1395bb8da86d5bf074e69e5a13f909194999c0989dabe967.lean#L1034).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `961976da577530921d5f6220ce4ed143b8e30aee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
