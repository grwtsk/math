## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b88bd635e6a92dbf917e92d2d36c5c434a5d0f74fdaceae7cfd115ddbe7f9543`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 770–797.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private partial def extractMonadInfo (ops : DoOps) (expectedType? : Option Expr) : Term.TermElabM (MonadInfo × Expr) := do
  let some expectedType := expectedType? | mkUnknownMonadResult
  let expectedType ← instantiateMVars expectedType
  let rec extract? (type : Expr) : Term.TermElabM (Option (MonadInfo × Expr)) := do
    match (← ops.splitMonadApp? type) with
    | some r => return r
    | none =>
      let typeNew ← whnfCore type
      if typeNew != type then
        extract? typeNew
      else
        if typeNew.getAppFn.isMVar then
          mkUnknownMonadResult
        else match (← unfoldDefinition? typeNew) with
          | some typeNew => extract? typeNew
          | none => return none
  match (← extract? expectedType) with
  | some r => return r
  | none   => throwError "invalid `do` notation, expected type is not a monad application{indentExpr expectedType}\nYou can use the `do` notation in pure code by writing `Id.run do` instead of `do`, where `Id` is the identity monad."
where
  mkUnknownMonadResult : TermElabM (MonadInfo × Expr) := do
    let u ← mkFreshLevelMVar
    let v ← mkFreshLevelMVar
    let m ← mkFreshExprMVar (← mkArrow (mkSort (mkLevelSucc u)) (mkSort (mkLevelSucc v))) (userName := `m)
    let resultType ← mkFreshExprMVar (mkSort (mkLevelSucc u)) (userName := `α)
    return ({ m, u, v }, resultType)

/-- Create the `Context` for `do` elaboration from the given expected type of a `do` block. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant5e186403a55f0bfae1764434a9ca82e4900cc67f1f3c664dd64feba834a3ffe2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant5e186403a55f0bfae1764434a9ca82e4900cc67f1f3c664dd64feba834a3ffe2.lean#L770).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d0c31f6213534340fa7b33f8a3eca82a2214a819` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
