## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:95a006b29dad7daa3645a55f71235dc9456930ed4c43c2b6289d385fb6101fa1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 335–345.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[instance_reducible] def ReaderT.wpInst {Pred : Type v}
  [Assertion Pred] [Assertion EPred] [WP (m α) α Pred EPred] :
    WP (ReaderT ρ m α) α (ρ → Pred) EPred where
  wpTrans x := ⟨fun post epost r => wp (x.run r) (fun a => post a r) epost⟩
  wp_trans_monotone x := fun post post' epost epost' hepost hpost r => by
    apply WP.wp_consequence_econs (x := x.run r)
    · intro a
      exact hpost a r
    · exact hepost

/-- `ReaderT` lifts a `WPMonad` instance by adding a reader argument. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2e58063e05ed0911711feecc20f1816a3a9dd218ec3c1cf9a3e844c334822c56.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2e58063e05ed0911711feecc20f1816a3a9dd218ec3c1cf9a3e844c334822c56.lean#L335).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d1dedb257778bb87b45c68c8d17aa6fdd3558336` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
