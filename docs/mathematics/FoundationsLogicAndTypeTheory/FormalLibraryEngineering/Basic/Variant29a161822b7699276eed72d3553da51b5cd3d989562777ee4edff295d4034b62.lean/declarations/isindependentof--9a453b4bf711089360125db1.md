## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0f00be9af23ee31f34cab57cbcd76f862c1859ae78446cc5c8bf7bec3a72d548`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 287–309.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def isIndependentOf (L : List MVarId) (g : MVarId) : MetaM Bool := g.withContext do
  let t ← instantiateMVars (← g.getType)
  if t.hasExprMVar then
    -- If the goal's type contains other meta-variables,
    -- we conservatively say that `g` is not independent.
    -- It would be possible to check if `L` depends on these meta-variables.
    return false
  if (← inferType t).isProp then
    -- If the goal is propositional,
    -- proof-irrelevance ensures it is independent of any other goals.
    return true
  if ← g.isSubsingleton then
    -- If the goal is a subsingleton, it is independent of any other goals.
    return true
  -- Finally, we check if the goal `g` appears in the type of any of the goals `L`.
  L.allM fun g' => do pure !((← getMVars (← g'.getType)).contains g)

/--
Replace hypothesis `hyp` in goal `g` with `proof : typeNew`.
The new hypothesis is given the same user name as the original,
it attempts to avoid reordering hypotheses, and the original is cleared if possible.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant29a161822b7699276eed72d3553da51b5cd3d989562777ee4edff295d4034b62.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant29a161822b7699276eed72d3553da51b5cd3d989562777ee4edff295d4034b62.lean#L287).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c203b5c6891867487729c1852f5847977b56231` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
