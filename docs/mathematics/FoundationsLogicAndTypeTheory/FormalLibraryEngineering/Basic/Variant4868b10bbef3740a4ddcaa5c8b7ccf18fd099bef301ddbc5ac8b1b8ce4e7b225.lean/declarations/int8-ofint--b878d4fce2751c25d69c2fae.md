## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3284652c635a6aaaf2c66c7cfdb26d34b3eed299dd1c4dc4c5936ec2eb953cef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 113–125.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Int8.ofInt (i : @& Int) : Int8 := ⟨⟨BitVec.ofInt 8 i⟩⟩
/--
Converts a natural number to an 8-bit signed integer, wrapping around on overflow.

This function is overridden at runtime with an efficient implementation.

Examples:
 * `Int8.ofNat 53 = 53`
 * `Int8.ofNat 127 = 127`
 * `Int8.ofNat 128 = -128`
 * `Int8.ofNat 255 = -1`

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant4868b10bbef3740a4ddcaa5c8b7ccf18fd099bef301ddbc5ac8b1b8ce4e7b225.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant4868b10bbef3740a4ddcaa5c8b7ccf18fd099bef301ddbc5ac8b1b8ce4e7b225.lean#L113).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `472c97c9ad377169d13f669003cf20e4a18a7913` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
