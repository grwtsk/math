## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7f1162de9d7626556a9b4c32d6a7e312864ccd943a7fd2e1a11bc3307d2a0a82`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 358–368.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
instance {n} : HShiftRight (BitVec m) (BitVec n) (BitVec m) := ⟨fun x y => x >>> y.toNat⟩

/--
Rotate left for bit vectors. All the bits of `x` are shifted to higher positions, with the top `n`
bits wrapping around to fill the low bits.

```lean
rotateLeft  0b0011#4 3 = 0b1001
```
SMT-Lib name: `rotate_left` except this operator uses a `Nat` shift amount.
-/
````

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant1e4a3a9a4a9b891be3d80e6a10a1efccbc23c08b9c581a496e81d99cea33ba99.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant1e4a3a9a4a9b891be3d80e6a10a1efccbc23c08b9c581a496e81d99cea33ba99.lean#L358).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4819fdc345bad844337e9dc990a19cce2f6be02e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
