## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3ce7a1c831d82e165a9dba3633ca8b4ae611d5d8edb36fe5c178dea7292da085`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1459–1468.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def longestMatchFn (left? : Option Syntax) : List (Parser × Nat) → ParserFn
  | []    => fun _ s => s.mkError "longestMatch: empty list"
  | [p]   => fun c s => runLongestMatchParser left? s.lhsPrec p.1.fn c s
  | p::ps => fun c s =>
    let startSize := s.stackSize
    let startLhsPrec := s.lhsPrec
    let startPos  := s.pos
    let s         := runLongestMatchParser left? s.lhsPrec p.1.fn c s
    longestMatchFnAux left? startSize startLhsPrec startPos p.2 ps c s

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant4537b34736a30b17f664c971154650fd7b470f292c539a700f9358c7c2ec8fc5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant4537b34736a30b17f664c971154650fd7b470f292c539a700f9358c7c2ec8fc5.lean#L1459).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0c62aceb1bdb5b06756ea41f268464313ddf7d15` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
