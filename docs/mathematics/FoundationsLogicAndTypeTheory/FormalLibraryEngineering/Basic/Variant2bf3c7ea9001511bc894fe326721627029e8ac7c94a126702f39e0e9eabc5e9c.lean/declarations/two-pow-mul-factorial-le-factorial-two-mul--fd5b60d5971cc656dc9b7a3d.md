## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:22240250-025f-3ea0-c12a-67a0fbcb4552`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 493–529.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-!
### Factorial via binary splitting.

We prove this is equal to the standard factorial and mark it `@[csimp]`.

We could proceed further, with either Legendre or Luschny methods.
-/

/-!
This is the highest factorial I can `#eval` using the naive implementation without a stack overflow:
```
/-- info: 114716 -/
#guard_msgs in
#eval 9718 ! |>.log2
```

Similarly, evaluation of `ascFactorial 100 15000` fails with the naive implementation
but works with the binary recursion.

We could implement a tail-recursive version (or just use `Nat.fold`),
but instead let's jump straight to binary splitting.

/-- `ascFactorial` implemented using binary splitting.

While this still performs the same number of multiplications,
the big-integer operands to each are much smaller. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2bf3c7ea9001511bc894fe326721627029e8ac7c94a126702f39e0e9eabc5e9c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2bf3c7ea9001511bc894fe326721627029e8ac7c94a126702f39e0e9eabc5e9c.lean#L493).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `88b49af15be7601bb308f21811d58f4ab718cc15` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
