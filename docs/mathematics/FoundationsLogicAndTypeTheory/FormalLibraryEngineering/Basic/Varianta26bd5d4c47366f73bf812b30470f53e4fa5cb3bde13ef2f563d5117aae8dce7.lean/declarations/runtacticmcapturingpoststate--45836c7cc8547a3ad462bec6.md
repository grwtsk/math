## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0953e825f8ae12668b1b4d0d219f86c4fb6bbafb28fe4ea85ebcf36d98ec800f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 323–336.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def runTacticMCapturingPostState (t : TacticM Unit) (preState : Meta.SavedState)
    (preGoals : List MVarId) : MetaM (Meta.SavedState × List MVarId) :=
  withoutModifyingState do
    let go : TacticM (Meta.SavedState × List MVarId) := do
      preState.restore
      t
      pruneSolvedGoals
      let postState ← show MetaM _ from saveState
      let postGoals ← getGoals
      pure (postState, postGoals)
    go |>.run { elaborator := .anonymous, recover := false }
       |>.run' { goals := preGoals }
       |>.run'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Varianta26bd5d4c47366f73bf812b30470f53e4fa5cb3bde13ef2f563d5117aae8dce7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Varianta26bd5d4c47366f73bf812b30470f53e4fa5cb3bde13ef2f563d5117aae8dce7.lean#L323).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4281b6146c35363d6674c987e20347ed25e5c5e6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
