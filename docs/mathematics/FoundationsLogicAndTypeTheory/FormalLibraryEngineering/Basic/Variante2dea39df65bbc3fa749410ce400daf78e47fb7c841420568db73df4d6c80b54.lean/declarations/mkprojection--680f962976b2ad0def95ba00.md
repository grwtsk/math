## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:917cebf0576121e1f8650074c174922a74199382789f61e2ed98a9d08150f12a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 359–371.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkProjection (e : Expr) (fieldName : Name) : MetaM Expr := do
  let .const structName _ := (← whnf (←inferType e)).getAppFn |
    throwError "{e} doesn't have a structure as type"
  let some baseStruct := findField? (← getEnv) structName fieldName |
    throwError "No parent of {structName} has field {fieldName}"
  let mut e := e
  for projName in (getPathToBaseStructure? (← getEnv) baseStruct structName).get! do
    let type ← whnf (← inferType e)
    let .const _structName us := type.getAppFn | throwError "{e} doesn't have a structure as type"
    e := mkAppN (.const projName us) (type.getAppArgs.push e)
  mkDirectProjection e fieldName

/-- Returns true if `e` contains a name `n` where `p n` is true. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variante2dea39df65bbc3fa749410ce400daf78e47fb7c841420568db73df4d6c80b54.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variante2dea39df65bbc3fa749410ce400daf78e47fb7c841420568db73df4d6c80b54.lean#L359).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `498269f375e51a869c0880c0504624880b357354` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
