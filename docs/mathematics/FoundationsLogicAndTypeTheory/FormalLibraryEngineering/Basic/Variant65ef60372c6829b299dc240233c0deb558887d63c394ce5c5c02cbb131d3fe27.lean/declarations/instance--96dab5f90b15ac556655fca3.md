## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:60da24913be9f802c64e448f88d063f401a6989a2d56df6cb9b9df0eedc58513`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 261–276.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Append WorkspaceEdit where
  append x y := {
    changes?           :=
      match x.changes?, y.changes? with
      | v, none | none, v => v
      | some x, some y => x.mergeWith (fun _ v₁ v₂ => v₁ ++ v₂) y
    documentChanges?   :=
      match x.documentChanges?, y.documentChanges? with
      | v, none | none, v => v
      | some x, some y => x ++ y
    changeAnnotations? :=
      match x.changeAnnotations?, y.changeAnnotations? with
      | v, none | none, v => v
      | some x, some y => x.mergeWith (fun _ _v₁ v₂ => v₂) y
  }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant65ef60372c6829b299dc240233c0deb558887d63c394ce5c5c02cbb131d3fe27.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant65ef60372c6829b299dc240233c0deb558887d63c394ce5c5c02cbb131d3fe27.lean#L261).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ee3c970c401054f3f7fcda360e52f1dd8661e02b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
