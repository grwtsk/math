## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:981695896717aa8136fb35939e1efecb4637cf67d0312c4b021ecd6b32ae8167`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 440–450.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def elabSetLibrarySuggestions : CommandElab
  | `(command| set_library_suggestions $selector) => do
    if `Lean.LibrarySuggestions.Basic ∉ (← getEnv).header.moduleNames then
      logWarning "Add `import Lean.LibrarySuggestions.Basic` before using the `set_library_suggestions` command."
    -- Generate a fresh name for the selector definition
    let name ← liftMacroM <| Macro.addMacroScope `_librarySuggestions
    -- Elaborate the definition with the library_suggestions attribute
    elabCommand (← `(@[library_suggestions] public meta def $(mkIdent name) : Selector := $selector))
  | _ => throwUnsupportedSyntax

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2070e1ce53687fe97d55b2d6a8bbac42e1589022f4bfc16c99b5ef01589c9f94.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2070e1ce53687fe97d55b2d6a8bbac42e1589022f4bfc16c99b5ef01589c9f94.lean#L440).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3e18afc9357aa3c4b8984eff5bfb18e439717a54` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
