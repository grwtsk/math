## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ae75af1654010283387ab7fb518b6dc88d494cae8b45866d777126141a222db7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 115–135.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public def Lean.MVarId.getRelevantConstants (g : MVarId) : MetaM NameSet := withContext g do
  -- `instantiateMVars` is needed so that constants are not lost behind assigned
  -- metavariables, e.g. the `?motive` left in a goal reached via `induction`.
  -- Note: this does not recover constants behind non-ground delayed-assigned
  -- metavariables. Without evidence this matters for premise selection,
  -- for now we avoid the extra complexity of walking the metavariable graph.
  let mut c ← (← instantiateMVars (← g.getType)).relevantConstantsAsSet
  for t in (← getLocalHyps) do
    c := c ∪ (← (← instantiateMVars (← inferType t)).relevantConstantsAsSet)
  return c

@[expose] public section

namespace Lean.LibrarySuggestions

/--
A `Suggestion` is essentially just an identifier and a confidence score that the identifier is relevant.
If the premise selection request included information about the intended use (e.g. in the simplifier, in `grind`, etc.)
the score may be adjusted for that application.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2070e1ce53687fe97d55b2d6a8bbac42e1589022f4bfc16c99b5ef01589c9f94.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2070e1ce53687fe97d55b2d6a8bbac42e1589022f4bfc16c99b5ef01589c9f94.lean#L115).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3e18afc9357aa3c4b8984eff5bfb18e439717a54` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
