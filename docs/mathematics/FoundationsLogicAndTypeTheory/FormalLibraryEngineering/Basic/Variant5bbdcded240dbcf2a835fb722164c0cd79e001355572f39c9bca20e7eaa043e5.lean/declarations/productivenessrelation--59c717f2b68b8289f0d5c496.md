## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:254b3b3bb85d994754fb8fb9822c99f233b480a2df7ec3426269f16d29171abf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1052–1062.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ProductivenessRelation (α : Type w) (m : Type w → Type w') {β : Type w}
    [Iterator α m β] where
  /--
  A well-founded relation such that if `it'` is obtained from `it` by skipping, then `Rel it' it`.
  -/
  Rel : (IterM (α := α) m β) → (IterM (α := α) m β) → Prop
  /-- `Rel` is well-founded. -/
  wf : WellFounded Rel
  /-- If `it'` is obtained from `it` by skipping, then `Rel it' it`. -/
  subrelation : ∀ {it it'}, it'.IsPlausibleSkipSuccessorOf it → Rel it' it

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant5bbdcded240dbcf2a835fb722164c0cd79e001355572f39c9bca20e7eaa043e5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant5bbdcded240dbcf2a835fb722164c0cd79e001355572f39c9bca20e7eaa043e5.lean#L1052).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8de2a849308ba2e5e940cd7bfc4ba26967d15915` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
