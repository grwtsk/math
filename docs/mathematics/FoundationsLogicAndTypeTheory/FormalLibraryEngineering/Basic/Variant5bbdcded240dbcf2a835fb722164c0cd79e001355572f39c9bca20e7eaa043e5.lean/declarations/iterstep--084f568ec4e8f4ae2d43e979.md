## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5cf86d384c0e4a2590402b27a5e8916ae7d0e5e87d97b9a5c6529cbb4bcd4e6c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 224–247.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive IterStep (α β) where
  /--
  `IterStep.yield it out` describes the situation that an iterator emits `out` and provides `it`
  as the succeeding iterator.
  -/
  | yield : (it : α) → (out : β) → IterStep α β
  /--
  `IterStep.skip it` describes the situation that an iterator does not emit anything in this
  iteration and provides `it'` as the succeeding iterator.

  Allowing `skip` steps is necessary to generate efficient code from a loop over an iterator.
  -/
  | skip : (it : α) → IterStep α β
  /--
  `IterStep.done` describes the situation that an iterator has finished and will neither emit
  more values nor cause any monadic effects. In this case, no succeeding iterator is provided.
  -/
  | done : IterStep α β

/--
Returns the succeeding iterator stored in an iterator step or `none` if the step is `.done`
and the iterator has finished.
-/
@[expose]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant5bbdcded240dbcf2a835fb722164c0cd79e001355572f39c9bca20e7eaa043e5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant5bbdcded240dbcf2a835fb722164c0cd79e001355572f39c9bca20e7eaa043e5.lean#L224).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8de2a849308ba2e5e940cd7bfc4ba26967d15915` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
