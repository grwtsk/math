## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6418fcdc-260b-3817-00a2-bfca7e73d852`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 121–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem trailingZeros_neg (x : Int) : trailingZeros (-x) = x.trailingZeros := by
  by_cases hx : x = 0
  · simp [hx]
  rcases x.emod_two_eq with h | h
  · rcases Int.dvd_of_emod_eq_zero h with ⟨a, rfl⟩
    simp only [Int.mul_ne_zero_iff, ne_eq, Int.reduceEq, not_false_eq_true, true_and] at hx
    rw [← Int.mul_neg, trailingZeros_two_mul hx, trailingZeros_two_mul (Int.neg_ne_zero.mpr hx)]
    rw [trailingZeros_neg]
  · simp [trailingZeros_eq_zero_of_mod_eq, h]

end Int

/--
A dyadic rational is either zero or of the form `n * 2^(-k)` for some (unique) `n k : Int`
where `n` is odd.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variante963f9a88268d61db206e831cac909a1cb1c7080bd470072ce2157518d28e4bf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variante963f9a88268d61db206e831cac909a1cb1c7080bd470072ce2157518d28e4bf.lean#L121).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `452395bb8cdf6ea14fb051fb7993a1dc2e361e38` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
