## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b966538c2dcc829482748773c76b601a8233846845bcd0fefebfc19e53712687`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 206–216.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def ExSum.cast : ExSum sα a → Σ a, ExSum sβ a
  | .zero => ⟨_, .zero⟩
  | .add a₁ a₂ => ⟨_, .add a₁.cast.2 a₂.cast.2⟩

end

/--
The result of evaluating an (unnormalized) expression `e` into the type family `E`
(one of `ExSum`, `ExProd`, `ExBase`) is a (normalized) element `e'`
and a representation `E e'` for it, and a proof of `e = e'`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant30d6ff178904066e38e8b2b30d7d08c90566b14a5750e9df1e8f0aa6d6bd506e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant30d6ff178904066e38e8b2b30d7d08c90566b14a5750e9df1e8f0aa6d6bd506e.lean#L206).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c0556d34bf7c0e9bdaf9836960c6b93fc2c23d35` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
