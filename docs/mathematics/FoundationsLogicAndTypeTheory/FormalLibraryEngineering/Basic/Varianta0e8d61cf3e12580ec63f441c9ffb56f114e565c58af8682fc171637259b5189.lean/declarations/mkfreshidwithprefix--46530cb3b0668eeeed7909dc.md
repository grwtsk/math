## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b72571a83e7764efc518ba53262d8e0aed04a24f1011763dc88dc706dd4ecd08`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–161.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkFreshIdWithPrefix [Monad m] [MonadNameGenerator m] («prefix» : Name) :
    m Name := do
  let ngen ← getNGen
  let r := { ngen with namePrefix := «prefix» }.curr
  setNGen ngen.next
  pure r

/--
`saturate1 goal tac` runs `tac` on `goal`, then on the resulting goals, etc.,
until `tac` does not apply to any goal any more (i.e. it returns `none`). The
order of applications is depth-first, so if `tac` generates goals `[g₁, g₂, ⋯]`,
we apply `tac` to `g₁` and recursively to all its subgoals before visiting `g₂`.
If `tac` does not apply to `goal`, `saturate1` returns `none`. Otherwise it
returns the generated subgoals to which `tac` did not apply. `saturate1`
respects the `MonadRecDepth` recursion limit.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Varianta0e8d61cf3e12580ec63f441c9ffb56f114e565c58af8682fc171637259b5189.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Varianta0e8d61cf3e12580ec63f441c9ffb56f114e565c58af8682fc171637259b5189.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3d6d8b031ec85deb068b62b568883578ad89ea03` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
