## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:af763ec1f49a62324a9b091eaadcd1458e10a3b96f4b9362454f0b9dc1f2131f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 25–38.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive HeapNode (α : Type u) where
  /-- An empty forest, which has depth `0`. -/
  | nil : HeapNode α
  /-- A forest of rank `r + 1` consists of a root `a`,
  a forest `child` of rank `r` elements greater than `a`,
  and another forest `sibling` of rank `r`. -/
  | node (a : α) (child sibling : HeapNode α) : HeapNode α
  deriving Repr

/--
The "real size" of the node, counting up how many values of type `α` are stored.
This is `O(n)` and is intended mainly for specification purposes.
For a well formed `HeapNode` the size is always `2^n - 1` where `n` is the depth.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant4f0c6c9760d0b374e37edb82aad29666263742d23e7779ec5fa7acb81b45cc42.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant4f0c6c9760d0b374e37edb82aad29666263742d23e7779ec5fa7acb81b45cc42.lean#L25).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c3051ad42ee714d97ee0c2949e1d9c7f356e6fa0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
