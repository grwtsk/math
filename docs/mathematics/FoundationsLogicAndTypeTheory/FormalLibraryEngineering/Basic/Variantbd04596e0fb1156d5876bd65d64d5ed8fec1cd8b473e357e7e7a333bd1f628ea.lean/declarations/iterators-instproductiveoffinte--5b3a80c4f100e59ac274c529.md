## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:030118e8eaf3dc27090a8bd7ce6c034519388ef0ad2fe5d4c565ad36e165b910`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1000–1020.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Iterators.instProductiveOfFinte [Iterator α m β] [Iterators.Finite α m] :
    Iterators.Productive α m where
  wf := by
    apply Subrelation.wf (r := IterM.IsPlausibleSuccessorOf)
    · intro it' it h
      exact IterM.isPlausibleSuccessorOf_of_skip h
    · exact Iterators.Finite.wf

end Productive

/--
This typeclass characterizes iterators that have deterministic return values. This typeclass does
*not* guarantee that there are no monadic side effects such as exceptions.

General monadic iterators can be nondeterministic, so that `it.IsPlausibleStep step` will be true
for no or more than one choice of `step`. This typeclass ensures that there is exactly one such
choice.

This is an experimental instance and it should not be explicitly used downstream of the standard
library.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variantbd04596e0fb1156d5876bd65d64d5ed8fec1cd8b473e357e7e7a333bd1f628ea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variantbd04596e0fb1156d5876bd65d64d5ed8fec1cd8b473e357e7e7a333bd1f628ea.lean#L1000).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `218f5af72498bb841935cbde7cddbbfacde49f6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
