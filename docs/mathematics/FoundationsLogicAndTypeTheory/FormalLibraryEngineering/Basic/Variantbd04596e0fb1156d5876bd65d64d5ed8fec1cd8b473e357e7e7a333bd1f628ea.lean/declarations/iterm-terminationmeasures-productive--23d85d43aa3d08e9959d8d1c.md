## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ce4266dcfbaa5bdac7c914c2784d45cb6892f9f0d50acd2dafaba1b5c713aa5c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 898–911.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure IterM.TerminationMeasures.Productive
    (α : Type w) (m : Type w → Type w') {β : Type w} [Iterator α m β] where
  /--
  The wrapped iterator.

  In the wrapper, its productivity is used as a termination measure.
  -/
  it : IterM (α := α) m β

/--
The relation of plausible successors while skipping on `IterM.TerminationMeasures.Productive`.
It is well-founded if there is a `Productive` instance.
-/
@[expose]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variantbd04596e0fb1156d5876bd65d64d5ed8fec1cd8b473e357e7e7a333bd1f628ea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variantbd04596e0fb1156d5876bd65d64d5ed8fec1cd8b473e357e7e7a333bd1f628ea.lean#L898).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `218f5af72498bb841935cbde7cddbbfacde49f6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
