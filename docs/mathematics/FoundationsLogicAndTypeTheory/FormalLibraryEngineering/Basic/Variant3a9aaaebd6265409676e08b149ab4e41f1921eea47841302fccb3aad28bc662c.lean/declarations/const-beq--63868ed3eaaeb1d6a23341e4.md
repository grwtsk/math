## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2c68fec1f81f55bf76fc83292f6b450d6f12d93d83b31c1181f1b86e6baa6e0f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1061–1067.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[inherit_doc DTreeMap.beq] def Const.beq {β : Type v} [BEq β] (t₁ t₂ : DTreeMap α (fun _ => β) cmp) : Bool :=
  letI : Ord α := ⟨cmp⟩; Internal.Impl.Const.beq t₁.inner t₂.inner

/--
Computes the difference of the given tree maps.
This function always iterates through the smaller map.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant3a9aaaebd6265409676e08b149ab4e41f1921eea47841302fccb3aad28bc662c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant3a9aaaebd6265409676e08b149ab4e41f1921eea47841302fccb3aad28bc662c.lean#L1061).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7926156d27c6b236b3566616cdee99867a8f2c7b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
