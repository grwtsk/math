## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:160a08368a1f10bcb0cc2551659d82cb5f56ea300b7957d968c5c69b587b562e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 145–155.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def compileDecl (decl : Declaration) : TermElabM Unit := do
  Lean.compileDecl
    -- `meta` should disregard `noncomputable section`
    (logErrors := !(← read).isNoncomputableSection || decl.getTopLevelNames.any (isMarkedMeta (← getEnv)))
    decl

register_builtin_option diagnostics.threshold.proofSize : Nat := {
  defValue := 16384
  descr    := "only display proof statistics when proof has at least this number of terms"
}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant23b6a694c6590583364cc8bed40c0218a514299c84ee5dcff563742197fc467f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant23b6a694c6590583364cc8bed40c0218a514299c84ee5dcff563742197fc467f.lean#L145).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8569777490d2b96ac8bda518eb179e7532e512f9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
