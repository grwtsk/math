## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9cbae598310ce571a5d7fce7ddafd095d8399ba1af39b776e3f27c9d7c80de42`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1561–1568.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def forallTelescope (type : Expr) (k : Array Expr → Expr → n α) (cleanupAnnotations := false) : n α :=
  map2MetaM (fun k => forallTelescopeImp type k cleanupAnnotations (whnfType := false)) k

/--
Given a monadic function `f` that takes a type and a term of that type and produces a new term,
lifts this to the monadic function that opens a `∀` telescope, applies `f` to the body,
and then builds the lambda telescope term for the new term.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant9339066e8c4df71c9aac2c348d9a3a7c2a8a9a20aca0d07228c26deef647d4a8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant9339066e8c4df71c9aac2c348d9a3a7c2a8a9a20aca0d07228c26deef647d4a8.lean#L1561).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b9743855e4f667c6fad1cee0803ee003e513baef` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
