## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7236e53522ba8c11bd30a97409cd06faf3f76b45cb524f695a82caf38b8d7ffb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 505–512.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def DoElemCont.ensureUnitAt (dec : DoElemCont) (ref : Syntax) : DoElabM DoElemCont := do
  dec.ensureHasTypeAt ref (← mkPUnit)

/--
Given a continuation `dec`, returns a continuation derived from `dec` with result type `PUnit`.
If `dec` already has result type `PUnit`, simply returns `dec`. Otherwise, an error is logged and a
new continuation is returned that calls `dec` with `sorry` as a result.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant38dd1fce5c451e57fd106239c1cdb3b4d2d550515c568fb847ebb9d66ed64b9f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant38dd1fce5c451e57fd106239c1cdb3b4d2d550515c568fb847ebb9d66ed64b9f.lean#L505).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8989d99b84b6c7ee7db899a0ac9d1716f4853e0f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
