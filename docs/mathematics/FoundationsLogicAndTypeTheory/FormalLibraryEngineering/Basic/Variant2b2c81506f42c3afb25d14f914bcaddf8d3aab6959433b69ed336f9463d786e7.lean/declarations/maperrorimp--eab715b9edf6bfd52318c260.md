## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:201e1bc1ba4edacdb6171ce5779e7ef603f217d756452e2aba9603e6d1f1beb1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2297–2307.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mapErrorImp (x : MetaM α) (f : MessageData → MessageData) : MetaM α := do
  try
    x
  catch
    | Exception.error ref msg =>
      let msg' := f msg
      let msg' ← addMessageContext msg'
      throw <| Exception.error ref msg'
    | ex => throw ex

/-- Execute `x`, and apply `f` to the produced error message -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2b2c81506f42c3afb25d14f914bcaddf8d3aab6959433b69ed336f9463d786e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2b2c81506f42c3afb25d14f914bcaddf8d3aab6959433b69ed336f9463d786e7.lean#L2297).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `20e3e5ee85818ad6002ce0762167e0d6b4cf7186` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
