## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:607a9816-57fd-d72a-b47d-4f2154a3bc69`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 226–233.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem succ_ascFactorial (n : ℕ) :
    ∀ k, n * n.succ.ascFactorial k = (n + k) * n.ascFactorial k
  | 0 => by rw [Nat.add_zero, ascFactorial_zero, ascFactorial_zero]
  | k + 1 => by rw [ascFactorial, Nat.mul_left_comm, succ_ascFactorial n k, ascFactorial, succ_add,
    ← Nat.add_assoc]

/-- `(n + 1).ascFactorial k = (n + k) ! / n !` but without ℕ-division. See
`Nat.ascFactorial_eq_div` for the version with ℕ-division. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2b7b326c433114d94c48f0046344bc905348c79a43afd393c865fdf2e4069f68.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant2b7b326c433114d94c48f0046344bc905348c79a43afd393c865fdf2e4069f68.lean#L226).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `73eff0c84061441501bc51e6f8c7c66c15f24b0a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
