## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:de683d4295cebe4060b016fdebf54465e60004908a14da328f0616f7a9cd9a6b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 692–701.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[inline] private unsafe def updateUsetImp (c : Code pu) (fvarId' : FVarId)
    (i' : Nat) (y' : FVarId) (k' : Code pu) : Code pu :=
  match c with
  | .uset fvarId i y k _ =>
    if ptrEq fvarId fvarId' && i == i' && ptrEq y y' && ptrEq k k' then
      c
    else
      .uset fvarId' i' y' k'
  | _ => unreachable!

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant9f86cfac11a407fd0300259723aff0e8f831c7e08eccede4e471c4332f2e6f0b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant9f86cfac11a407fd0300259723aff0e8f831c7e08eccede4e471c4332f2e6f0b.lean#L692).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `55d9349922caca962355b592fb556e2a5b699fdd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
