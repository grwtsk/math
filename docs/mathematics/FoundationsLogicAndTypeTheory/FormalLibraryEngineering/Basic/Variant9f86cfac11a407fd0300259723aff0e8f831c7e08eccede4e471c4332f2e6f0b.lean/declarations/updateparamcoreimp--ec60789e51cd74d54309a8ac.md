## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b0ec21ff095ee748c1ed736b08f899a3b6b1b85a1fac8b91a4ee6fa03486cab9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 766–776.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private unsafe def updateParamCoreImp (p : Param pu) (type : Expr) : Param pu :=
  if ptrEq type p.type then
    p
  else
    { p with type }

/--
Low-level update `Param` function. It does not update the local context.
Consider using `Param.update : Param → Expr → CompilerM Param` if you want the local context
to be updated.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant9f86cfac11a407fd0300259723aff0e8f831c7e08eccede4e471c4332f2e6f0b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant9f86cfac11a407fd0300259723aff0e8f831c7e08eccede4e471c4332f2e6f0b.lean#L766).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `55d9349922caca962355b592fb556e2a5b699fdd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
