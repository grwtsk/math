## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d1e2830b960899a23e48bace04388e7430636c62d2b82c4703fb75145b2603a3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 86–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def LitValue.toExpr : LitValue → Expr
  | .nat v => .lit (.natVal v)
  | .str v => .lit (.strVal v)
  | .uint8 v => .app (.const ``UInt8.ofNat []) (.lit (.natVal (UInt8.toNat v)))
  | .uint16 v => .app (.const ``UInt16.ofNat []) (.lit (.natVal (UInt16.toNat v)))
  | .uint32 v => .app (.const ``UInt32.ofNat []) (.lit (.natVal (UInt32.toNat v)))
  | .uint64 v => .app (.const ``UInt64.ofNat []) (.lit (.natVal (UInt64.toNat v)))
  | .usize v => .app (.const ``USize.ofNat []) (.lit (.natVal (UInt64.toNat v)))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant9f86cfac11a407fd0300259723aff0e8f831c7e08eccede4e471c4332f2e6f0b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant9f86cfac11a407fd0300259723aff0e8f831c7e08eccede4e471c4332f2e6f0b.lean#L86).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `55d9349922caca962355b592fb556e2a5b699fdd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
