## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:aebeb61526be2ae27a984683af029be86e99577e85aedc95392c6b2971f290aa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 699–716.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected noncomputable def flattenList {n : Nat} (xs : List (BitVec n)) : BitVec (n * xs.length) :=
  match xs with
  | [] => 0#0
  | x :: rest =>
    have h : n + n * List.length rest = n * List.length (x :: rest) := by
      simp [List.length_cons, Nat.mul_add, Nat.add_comm]
    BitVec.cast h (x ++ (BitVec.flattenList rest))

/-!
### Cons and Concat
We give special names to the operations of adding a single bit to either end of a bitvector.
We follow the precedent of `Vector.cons`/`Vector.concat` both for the name, and for the decision
to have the resulting size be `n + 1` for both operations (rather than `1 + n`, which would be the
result of appending a single bit to the front in the naive implementation).
-/

/-- Append a single bit to the end of a bitvector, using big endian order (see `append`).
    That is, the new bit is the least significant bit. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variantf1d2a57b7a2c2e3de9fbd74c6f23354d14d2c9e4c185c461c775c038ee2d6c35.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variantf1d2a57b7a2c2e3de9fbd74c6f23354d14d2c9e4c185c461c775c038ee2d6c35.lean#L699).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1122508b14f82b41217c28ca050d418a8f223c86` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
