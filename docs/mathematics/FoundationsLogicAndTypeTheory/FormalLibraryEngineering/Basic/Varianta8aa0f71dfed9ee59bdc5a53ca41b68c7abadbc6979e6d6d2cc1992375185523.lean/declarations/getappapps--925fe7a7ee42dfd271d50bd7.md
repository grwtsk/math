## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4284b308f6d9c4d75afd6b041422837e7b37c2fff80d80f75e5609ea47c9065e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 182–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getAppApps (e : Expr) : Array Expr :=
  let dummy := mkSort levelZero
  let nargs := e.getAppNumArgs
  getAppAppsAux e (.replicate nargs dummy) (nargs-1)

/-- Erase proofs in an expression by replacing them with `sorry`s.

This function replaces all proofs in the expression
and in the types that appear in the expression
by `sorryAx`s.
The resulting expression has the same type as the old one.

It is useful, e.g., to verify if the proof-irrelevant part of a definition depends on a variable.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Varianta8aa0f71dfed9ee59bdc5a53ca41b68c7abadbc6979e6d6d2cc1992375185523.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Varianta8aa0f71dfed9ee59bdc5a53ca41b68c7abadbc6979e6d6d2cc1992375185523.lean#L182).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `030b7089fd4e3f5264c0b786eeccbc78ee0fc05b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
