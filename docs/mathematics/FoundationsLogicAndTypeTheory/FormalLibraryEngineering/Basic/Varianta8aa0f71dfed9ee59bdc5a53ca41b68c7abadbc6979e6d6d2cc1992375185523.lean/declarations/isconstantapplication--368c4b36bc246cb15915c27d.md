## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:60120476d68831a6f6155de21ef344ece8b69786798bc340ca0bb1f7a0dfea84`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 212–222.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def isConstantApplication (e : Expr) :=
  e.isApp && aux e.getAppNumArgs'.pred e.getAppFn' e.getAppNumArgs'
where
  /-- `aux depth e n` checks whether the body of the `n`-th lambda of `e` has loose bvar
    `depth - 1`. -/
  aux (depth : Nat) : Expr → Nat → Bool
    | .lam _ _ b _, n + 1  => aux depth b n
    | e, 0  => !e.hasLooseBVar (depth - 1)
    | _, _ => false

/-- Counts the immediate depth of a nested `let` expression. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Varianta8aa0f71dfed9ee59bdc5a53ca41b68c7abadbc6979e6d6d2cc1992375185523.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Varianta8aa0f71dfed9ee59bdc5a53ca41b68c7abadbc6979e6d6d2cc1992375185523.lean#L212).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `030b7089fd4e3f5264c0b786eeccbc78ee0fc05b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
