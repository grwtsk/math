## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:97bd5267be4f65bf65a0797028b7294a6b978146a9ead71abb5aa19cce6a3092`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–106.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Equiv (m₁ m₂ : Raw α β cmp) where
  /-- Internal implementation detail of the tree map -/
  inner : m₁.1.Equiv m₂.1

@[inherit_doc] scoped infix:50 " ~m " => Equiv

@[simp, grind =]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant224f4987b7c899cbed6ea6c5fb79bf1b1ca9e4f9d0891a3678a723148ca606d6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Basic/Variant224f4987b7c899cbed6ea6c5fb79bf1b1ca9e4f9d0891a3678a723148ca606d6.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `08868e6562f32497e103cb7f6bc5d5f063bd4fa2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
