## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:510c37563205f2e5cf68098a5abd20413e055a38581574f4056234b1b67b3f73`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 150–165.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def SnapshotTree.collectMessagesInRange (tree : SnapshotTree)
    (requestedRange : Lean.Syntax.Range) : ServerTask MessageLog :=
  tree.foldSnaps (init := .empty) fun snap log => Id.run do
    let some stx := snap.stx?
      | return .pure (log, .proceed (foldChildren := true))
    let some range := stx.getRangeWithTrailing? (canonicalOnly := true)
      | return .pure (log, .proceed (foldChildren := true))
    if ! range.overlaps requestedRange (includeFirstStop := true) (includeSecondStop := true) then
      return .pure (log, .proceed (foldChildren := false))
    return snap.task.asServerTask.mapCheap fun tree => Id.run do
      return (log ++ tree.element.diagnostics.msgLog, .proceed (foldChildren := true))

end Lean.Language

namespace Lean.Server

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Requests/Variant064d31bc02bec694f7f594bd7c72f6577161d2e386ad0d01f460dfae3e6342e2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Requests/Variant064d31bc02bec694f7f594bd7c72f6577161d2e386ad0d01f460dfae3e6342e2.lean#L150).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c3d3567550c36bc17864ff884e4a4e620ae5a15d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
