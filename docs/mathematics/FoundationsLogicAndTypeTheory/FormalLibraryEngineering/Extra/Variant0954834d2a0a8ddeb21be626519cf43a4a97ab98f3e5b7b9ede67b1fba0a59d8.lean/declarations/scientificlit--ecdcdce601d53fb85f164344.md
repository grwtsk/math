## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cf501ffe03b688d148aa1bef32851a33fe97be2def81ed0c127d454799411c2e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 142–151.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[run_builtin_parser_attribute_hooks, builtin_doc] def scientificLit : Parser :=
  withAntiquot (mkAntiquot "scientific" scientificLitKind) scientificLitNoAntiquot

/-- The parser `str` parses a string literal, such as `"foo"` or `"\r\n"`. Strings can contain
C-style escapes like `\n`, `\"`, `\x00` or `\u2665`, as well as literal unicode characters like `∈`.
Newlines in a string are interpreted literally.

This parser has arity 1: it produces a `strLitKind` node containing an atom with the raw
literal (including the quote marks and without interpreting the escapes).
You can use `TSyntax.getString` to decode the string from the resulting syntax object. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Extra/Variant0954834d2a0a8ddeb21be626519cf43a4a97ab98f3e5b7b9ede67b1fba0a59d8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Extra/Variant0954834d2a0a8ddeb21be626519cf43a4a97ab98f3e5b7b9ede67b1fba0a59d8.lean#L142).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `25a8e0faa8178fd041d15156669400c9b49c22c7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
