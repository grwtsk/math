## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6f1bc2c724ce1cd7a3d1c444bcbb17a81b762ab84babe35eb406c66224793116`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 492–504.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkSimpTheoremFromExpr (id : Origin) (levelParams : Array Name) (proof : Expr) (inv := false)
    (post := true) (prio : Nat := eval_prio default) (config : ConfigWithKey := simpGlobalConfig) :
    MetaM (Array SimpTheorem) := do
  if proof.isConst then
    -- Recall that we use `simpGlobalConfig` for processing global declarations.
    mkSimpTheoremFromConst proof.constName! post inv prio
  else
    withConfigWithKey config do
      withReducible do
        (← preprocessProof proof inv).mapM fun val =>
          mkSimpTheoremCore id val levelParams val post prio (noIndexAtArgs := true)

/-- Creates a `SimpTheorem` from a definitional equality.  -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimpTheorems/Variant4464c13b99a98a25aebb001e842ec52f82cbf86efa5cb7fa6dd4d0c1e3645cf7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimpTheorems/Variant4464c13b99a98a25aebb001e842ec52f82cbf86efa5cb7fa6dd4d0c1e3645cf7.lean#L492).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `375077889ab38d6151fbb04b213bf66513572d23` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
