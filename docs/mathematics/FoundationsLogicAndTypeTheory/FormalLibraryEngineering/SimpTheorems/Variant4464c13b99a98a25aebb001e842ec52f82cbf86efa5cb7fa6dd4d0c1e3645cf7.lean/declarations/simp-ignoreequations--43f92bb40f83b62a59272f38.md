## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e651c280b8350a71b7e8e06d0afe72876ff088344366ec4e26c3bf16e4e80811`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 534–549.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Simp.ignoreEquations (declName : Name) : CoreM Bool := do
  return (← isProjectionFn declName) || (← isReducible declName)

/--
Even if a function has equation theorems,
we also store it in the `toUnfold` set in the following two cases:
1- It was defined by structural recursion and has a smart-unfolding associated declaration.
2- It is non-recursive.

Reason: `unfoldPartialApp := true` or conditional equations may not apply.

Remark: In the future, we are planning to disable this
behavior unless `unfoldPartialApp := true`.
Moreover, users will have to use `f.eq_def` if they want to force the definition to be
unfolded.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimpTheorems/Variant4464c13b99a98a25aebb001e842ec52f82cbf86efa5cb7fa6dd4d0c1e3645cf7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimpTheorems/Variant4464c13b99a98a25aebb001e842ec52f82cbf86efa5cb7fa6dd4d0c1e3645cf7.lean#L534).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `375077889ab38d6151fbb04b213bf66513572d23` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
