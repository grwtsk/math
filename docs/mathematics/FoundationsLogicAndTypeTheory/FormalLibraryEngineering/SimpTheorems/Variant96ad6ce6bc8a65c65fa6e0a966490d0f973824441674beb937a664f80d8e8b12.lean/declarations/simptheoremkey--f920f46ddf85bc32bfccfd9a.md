## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:acedb68af6129094c0f2b0dc1f7faea11c1a37ca672fe06296d1507b70cdf503`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 152–162.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev SimpTheoremKey := DiscrTree.Key

/--
  The fields `levelParams` and `proof` are used to encode the proof of the simp theorem.
  If the `proof` is a global declaration `c`, we store `Expr.const c []` at `proof` without the universe levels, and `levelParams` is set to `#[]`
  When using the lemma, we create fresh universe metavariables.
  Motivation: most simp theorems are global declarations, and this approach is faster and saves memory.

  The field `levelParams` is not empty only when we elaborate an expression provided by the user, and it contains universe metavariables.
  Then, we use `abstractMVars` to abstract the universe metavariables and create new fresh universe parameters that are stored at the field `levelParams`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimpTheorems/Variant96ad6ce6bc8a65c65fa6e0a966490d0f973824441674beb937a664f80d8e8b12.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/SimpTheorems/Variant96ad6ce6bc8a65c65fa6e0a966490d0f973824441674beb937a664f80d8e8b12.lean#L152).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6cf6e9e19687239e0524540d7f004f81f941f560` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
