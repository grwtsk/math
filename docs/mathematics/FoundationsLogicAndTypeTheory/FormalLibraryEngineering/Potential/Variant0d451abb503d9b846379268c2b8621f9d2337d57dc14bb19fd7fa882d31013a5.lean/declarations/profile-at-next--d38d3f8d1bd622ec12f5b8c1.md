## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e88cfa84-3ebf-475d-d618-e916e40b4b1f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 592–603.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem profile_at_next {n : Nat} {T : Expr S} {s : S}
    (ht : PureTypeSystem.HasType P (Ω.context n) (T.rename (Expr.reverseIndex n)) (.sort s)) :
    Profile P (Ω.context (n+1)) (T.rename (Expr.reverseIndex (n+1))) =
      Profile P (Ω.context n) (T.rename (Expr.reverseIndex n)) := by
  have hs : T.Scoped n := by
    have h := ht.scope.1.reverseIndex
    rwa [Ω.length, Expr.reverseIndex_twice] at h
  obtain ⟨D, t, hD, he⟩ := Ω.step n
  rw [he, hs.reverseIndex_succ]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Potential/Variant0d451abb503d9b846379268c2b8621f9d2337d57dc14bb19fd7fa882d31013a5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Potential/Variant0d451abb503d9b846379268c2b8621f9d2337d57dc14bb19fd7fa882d31013a5.lean#L592).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2e1a55517e60d102cb4397d4882ff100b98272e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
