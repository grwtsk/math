## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:41cdb2a8-7c3d-2096-5328-1eac1639da16`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 134–146.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exp_le_275_cert : ∀ x ∈ I01, Expr.eval (fun _ => x) exprExp ≤ (11/4 : ℚ) :=
  verify_upper_bound exprExp exprExp_core I01 (11/4) { taylorDepth := 15 } (by native_decide)

/-! ### Combined expression: x * exp(x)

This demonstrates the certificate system on a more complex expression.
On [0, 1], we have:
- x ∈ [0, 1]
- exp(x) ∈ [1, e]
- x * exp(x) ∈ [0, e] ≈ [0, 2.718]
-/

/-- x * exp(x) ≤ 3 on [0, 1] -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Certificate/Variant751c43769cb43649ad2c560b51fbc50dcba787bde6b6f9ae4ca70657016b2adc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Certificate/Variant751c43769cb43649ad2c560b51fbc50dcba787bde6b6f9ae4ca70657016b2adc.lean#L134).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b8c22aaf7d8d5fbf00f2ecc04ebcdc63667e183f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
