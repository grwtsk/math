## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:46251ba122b7148a5b57d05de0c27d09e2bd157746d9d0cbb13a42cfa25dc747`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 360–376.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[pp_nodot] def logC (b m : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  if h : 1 < b then let (_, e) := step b h; e else 0 where
  /--
  An auxiliary definition for `Nat.logC`, where the base of the logarithm is _squared_ in each
  loop. This allows significantly faster computation of the logarithm: it takes logarithmic time
  in the size of the output, rather than linear time.
  -/
  step (pw : ℕ) (hpw : 1 < pw) : ℕ × ℕ :=
    if h : m < pw then (m, 0)
    else
      let (q, e) := step (pw * pw) (Nat.mul_lt_mul_of_lt_of_lt hpw hpw)
      if q < pw then (q, 2 * e) else (q / pw, 2 * e + 1)
  termination_by m / pw
  decreasing_by
    have : m / (pw * pw) < m / pw := logC_aux hpw (le_of_not_lt h)
    decreasing_trivial

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Log/Variant9eab5ad0ff8a391d42184aba2572264202bffdcf6d3e2df5005942764ecdae72.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Log/Variant9eab5ad0ff8a391d42184aba2572264202bffdcf6d3e2df5005942764ecdae72.lean#L360).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e7cd69ff8fd13e2a9a5e98320f6b8953bfefd064` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
