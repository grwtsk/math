## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cff29fe20315f865e14392f4cbdc1f8b81ef8815538ef3f640d01cd2238baa30`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 575–586.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[inline] public def replayLog?
  [Monad n] [logger : MonadLog n] [MonadLiftT m n] (self : ELogT m α)
: n (Option α) := do
  match (← self.run {}) with
  | .ok a log => log.replay (logger := logger) *> pure (some a)
  | .error _ log => log.replay (logger := logger) *> pure none

/--
Runs `self` in `n` and then replays the entries of the resulting log
using the new monad's `logger`. Translates an exception in this monad to
a `failure` in the new monad.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Log/Variant037657c055d4e9d29ad5d757f19c729c1b1e751650f07e793ead97423ee45f7b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Log/Variant037657c055d4e9d29ad5d757f19c729c1b1e751650f07e793ead97423ee45f7b.lean#L575).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93ff18daf5c508d7b31c153f2ca5fdb5aa29d170` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
