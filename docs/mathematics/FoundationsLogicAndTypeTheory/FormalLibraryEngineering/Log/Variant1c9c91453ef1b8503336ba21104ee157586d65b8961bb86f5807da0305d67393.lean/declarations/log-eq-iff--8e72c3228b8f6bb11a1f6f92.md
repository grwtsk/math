## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:10423c2b-34f3-b731-40e6-c967433977ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 207–218.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem log_eq_iff {b m n : ℕ} (h : m ≠ 0 ∨ 1 < b ∧ n ≠ 0) :
    log b n = m ↔ b ^ m ≤ n ∧ n < b ^ (m + 1) := by
  rcases em (1 < b ∧ n ≠ 0) with (⟨hb, hn⟩ | hbn)
  · rw [le_antisymm_iff, ← Nat.lt_succ_iff, le_log_iff_pow_le, log_lt_iff_lt_pow,
      and_comm] <;> assumption
  have hm : m ≠ 0 := h.resolve_right hbn
  rw [not_and_or, not_lt, Ne, not_not] at hbn
  rcases hbn with (hb | rfl)
  · obtain rfl | rfl := le_one_iff_eq_zero_or_eq_one.1 hb <;>
      simp only [log_zero_left, log_one_left] <;> lia
  · simp [@eq_comm _ 0, hm]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Log/Variant1c9c91453ef1b8503336ba21104ee157586d65b8961bb86f5807da0305d67393.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Log/Variant1c9c91453ef1b8503336ba21104ee157586d65b8961bb86f5807da0305d67393.lean#L207).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bdee3efd314299c4cd57f0c986c643051e25eddc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
