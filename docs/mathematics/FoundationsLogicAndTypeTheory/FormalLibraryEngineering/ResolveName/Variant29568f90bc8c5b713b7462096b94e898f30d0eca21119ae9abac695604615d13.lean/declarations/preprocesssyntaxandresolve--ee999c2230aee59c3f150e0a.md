## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bd496cf6728863f4e0ca3c93dc3d34e267fdc1f4690b6a96bf21589f385fa969`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 382–418.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

def preprocessSyntaxAndResolve (stx : Syntax) (k : Name → m (List Name)) : m (List Name) := do
  match stx with
  | .ident _ _ n pre => do
    let pre := pre.filterMap fun
      | .decl n [] => some n
      | _          => none
    if pre.isEmpty then
      withRef stx <| k n
    else
      return pre
  | _ => throwErrorAt stx s!"expected identifier"

/--
Interprets the syntax `n` as an identifier for a global constant, and returns a list of resolved
constant names that it could be referring to based on the currently open namespaces.
This should be used instead of `resolveGlobalConstCore` for identifiers taken from syntax
because `Syntax` objects may have names that have already been resolved.

Consider using `realizeGlobalConst` if you need to handle reserved names, and
`realizeGlobalConstWithInfo` if you want the syntax to show the resulting name's info on hover.

## Example:
```
def Boo.x   := 1
def Foo.x   := 2
def Foo.x.y := 3
```
After `open Foo`, we have
- `resolveGlobalConst x`     => `[Foo.x]`
- `resolveGlobalConst x.y`   => `[Foo.x.y]`
- `resolveGlobalConst x.z.w` => error: unknown constant

After `open Foo open Boo`, we have
- `resolveGlobalConst x`     => `[Foo.x, Boo.x]`
- `resolveGlobalConst x.y`   => `[Foo.x.y]`
- `resolveGlobalConst x.z.w` => error: unknown constant

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ResolveName/Variant29568f90bc8c5b713b7462096b94e898f30d0eca21119ae9abac695604615d13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ResolveName/Variant29568f90bc8c5b713b7462096b94e898f30d0eca21119ae9abac695604615d13.lean#L382).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b687cc6b3cb76fc6a2f6f726d494f46ea541614b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
