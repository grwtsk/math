## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0162eed6d0fa64055ac597fb7320cfb0e5a44d8b63f0b8ec23df1992fce94f84`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 142–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def resolveQualifiedName (env : Environment) (opts : Options) (ns : Name) (id : Name) : List Name := Id.run do
  let resolvedId    := ns ++ id
  -- We ignore protected aliases if `id` is atomic.
  let resolvedIds   := getAliases env resolvedId (skipProtected := id.isAtomic)
  if !id.isAtomic || !isProtected env resolvedId then
    if containsDeclOrReserved env resolvedId then
      return resolvedId :: resolvedIds
    else if let some resolvedIdPrv := resolvePrivateName env opts resolvedId then
      return resolvedIdPrv :: resolvedIds
  return resolvedIds

/-- Check surrounding namespaces -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ResolveName/Variant8902ed459df9c2db106f9f3288c1cf81ee0b6b8cdc39a4addc6076af8254855c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ResolveName/Variant8902ed459df9c2db106f9f3288c1cf81ee0b6b8cdc39a4addc6076af8254855c.lean#L142).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2319fa27798d8ccf8726fbe4ba7ff44c319b1269` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
