## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:97a2d0bd05376dec0fbc8fe4f80bbc4e4ba547e7054089dff3b5b8d3ec25ce56`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 435–463.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
def ensureNonAmbiguous (id : Syntax) (cs : List Name) : m Name := do
  match cs with
  | []  => unreachable!
  | [c] => pure c
  | _   => throwErrorAt id s!"ambiguous identifier `{id}`, possible interpretations: {cs.map mkConst}"

/-- Interprets the syntax `n` as an identifier for a global constant, and return a resolved
constant name. If there are multiple possible interpretations it will throw.

Consider using `realizeGlobalConstNoOverload` if you need to handle reserved names, and
`realizeGlobalConstNoOverloadWithInfo` if you
want the syntax to show the resulting name's info on hover.

## Example:
```
def Boo.x   := 1
def Foo.x   := 2
def Foo.x.y := 3
```
After `open Foo`, we have
- `resolveGlobalConstNoOverload x`     => `Foo.x`
- `resolveGlobalConstNoOverload x.y`   => `Foo.x.y`
- `resolveGlobalConstNoOverload x.z.w` => error: unknown constant

After `open Foo open Boo`, we have
- `resolveGlobalConstNoOverload x`     => error: ambiguous identifier
- `resolveGlobalConstNoOverload x.y`   => `Foo.x.y`
- `resolveGlobalConstNoOverload x.z.w` => error: unknown constant

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ResolveName/Variant8902ed459df9c2db106f9f3288c1cf81ee0b6b8cdc39a4addc6076af8254855c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/ResolveName/Variant8902ed459df9c2db106f9f3288c1cf81ee0b6b8cdc39a4addc6076af8254855c.lean#L435).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2319fa27798d8ccf8726fbe4ba7ff44c319b1269` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
