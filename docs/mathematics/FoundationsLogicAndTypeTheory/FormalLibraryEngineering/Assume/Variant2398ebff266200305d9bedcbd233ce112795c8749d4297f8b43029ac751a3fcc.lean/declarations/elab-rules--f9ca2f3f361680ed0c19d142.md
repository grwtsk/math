## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `elab_rules` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7bebac5dfcbfa6c3c427b5e489f5439535495bdb7d4259e3544fe6ead5f231a1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 34–49.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
elab_rules : tactic
  | `(tactic| assume $[$t?:term]?) => do
    let some t := t?
      | throwError "Tactic 'assume' failed: No hypotheses given."
    withMainContext do
      let e ← elabTerm t (some (.sort .zero))
      let eType ← inferType e
      let .true ← isDefEq eType (.sort .zero) |
        throwErrorAt t "Tactic 'assume' failed: Given type{indentExpr e}\nis not a proposition."
      let tgt ← getMainTarget
      let .forallE _ b _ _ ← whnf tgt |
        throwErrorAt t "Tactic 'assume' failed: Goal{indentExpr tgt}\nis not an implication."
      let .true ← isDefEq b e |
        throwErrorAt t "Tactic 'assume' failed: Given type{indentExpr e}\ndoes not match the \
        type{indentExpr b}\nof the hypothesis in the goal."
      evalTactic (← `(tactic | intro (_ : $t)))
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Assume/Variant2398ebff266200305d9bedcbd233ce112795c8749d4297f8b43029ac751a3fcc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Assume/Variant2398ebff266200305d9bedcbd233ce112795c8749d4297f8b43029ac751a3fcc.lean#L34).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `725d462adec1e0042c4b3da62783961d32a9c936` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
