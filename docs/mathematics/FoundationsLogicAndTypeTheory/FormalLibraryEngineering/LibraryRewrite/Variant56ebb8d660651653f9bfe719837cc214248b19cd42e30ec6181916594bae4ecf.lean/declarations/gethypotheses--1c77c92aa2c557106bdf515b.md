## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:af911a32429796f5aaec91d6ef783e9d3f9ad66ebd48ea933d74f00767a5812a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 277–287.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getHypotheses (except : Option FVarId) : MetaM (RefinedDiscrTree (FVarId × Bool)) :=
  withReducible do
  let mut tree : PreDiscrTree (FVarId × Bool) := {}
  for decl in ← getLCtx do
    if !decl.isImplementationDetail && except.all (· != decl.fvarId) then
      for (val, entries) in ← addLocalRewriteEntry decl do
        for (key, entry) in entries do
          tree := tree.push key (entry, val)
  return tree.toRefinedDiscrTree

/-- Return all applicable hypothesis rewrites of `e`. Similar to `getImportRewrites`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LibraryRewrite/Variant56ebb8d660651653f9bfe719837cc214248b19cd42e30ec6181916594bae4ecf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LibraryRewrite/Variant56ebb8d660651653f9bfe719837cc214248b19cd42e30ec6181916594bae4ecf.lean#L277).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d0a5a65b9e2d0cabd8a46a05baeeb364331aa3dc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
