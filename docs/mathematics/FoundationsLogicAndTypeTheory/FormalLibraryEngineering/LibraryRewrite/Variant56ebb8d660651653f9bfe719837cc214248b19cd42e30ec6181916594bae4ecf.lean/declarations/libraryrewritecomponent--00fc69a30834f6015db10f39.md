## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:27b2ff7ab0a9fe08f8a9825e2d3498efb242a227d236ba380abc8d5e14b413d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 541–553.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def LibraryRewriteComponent : Component SelectInsertParams :=
  mk_rpc_widget% LibraryRewrite.rpc

/--
`rw??` is an interactive tactic that suggests rewrites for any expression selected by the user.
To use it, shift-click an expression in the goal or a hypothesis that you want to rewrite.
Clicking on one of the rewrite suggestions will paste the relevant rewrite tactic into the editor.

The rewrite suggestions are grouped and sorted by the pattern that the rewrite lemmas match with.
Rewrites that don't change the goal and rewrites that create the same goal as another rewrite
are filtered out, as well as rewrites that have new metavariables in the replacement expression.
To see all suggestions, click on the filter button (▼) in the top right.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LibraryRewrite/Variant56ebb8d660651653f9bfe719837cc214248b19cd42e30ec6181916594bae4ecf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/LibraryRewrite/Variant56ebb8d660651653f9bfe719837cc214248b19cd42e30ec6181916594bae4ecf.lean#L541).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d0a5a65b9e2d0cabd8a46a05baeeb364331aa3dc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
