## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7422bdfd-820c-c4dd-cbf2-18947463a717`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 457–460.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem gcd_div_gcd_div_gcd_of_pos_left {n m : Nat} (h : 0 < n) :
    gcd (n / gcd n m) (m / gcd n m) = 1 := by
  rw [gcd_div (gcd_dvd_left _ _) (gcd_dvd_right _ _), Nat.div_self (gcd_pos_of_pos_left _ h)]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/GCD/Variant718d32982701bb38d5c47b211601c6d66766eabc696bda4501912adb09eb7e5c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Gcd/Variant718d32982701bb38d5c47b211601c6d66766eabc696bda4501912adb09eb7e5c.lean#L457).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `16e6ad06ce019ea97bf4794e71b5ccc08a8eae30` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
