## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e399d59b5f0ded87804a989e6f7fe4e704945a533dc4d050cf7b4b7a8b9ae395`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 72–83.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IterM.Intermediate.dropWhileM [Monad m] [MonadAttach m] (P : β → m (ULift Bool)) (dropping : Bool)
    (it : IterM (α := α) m β) :=
  (IterM.Intermediate.dropWhileWithPostcondition (PostconditionT.attachLift ∘ P) dropping it : IterM m β)

/--
Constructs intermediate states of an iterator created with the combinator `IterM.dropWhile`.
When `it.dropWhile P` has stopped dropping elements, its new state cannot be created
directly with `IterM.dropWhile` but only with `Intermediate.dropWhile`.

`Intermediate.dropWhile` is meant to be used only for internally or for verification purposes.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DropWhile/Variant25c105d2a691d404d8f68d6b98c5c99650c94f455fec3d31768c791bc0d8d7e6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DropWhile/Variant25c105d2a691d404d8f68d6b98c5c99650c94f455fec3d31768c791bc0d8d7e6.lean#L72).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9fbcb72ea036e9ebf5df42ca2643f942c057de06` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
