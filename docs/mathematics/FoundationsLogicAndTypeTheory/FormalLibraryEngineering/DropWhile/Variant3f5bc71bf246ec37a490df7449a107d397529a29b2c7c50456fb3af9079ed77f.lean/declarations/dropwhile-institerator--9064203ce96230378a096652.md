## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6cfaa2488b4cc3f0aba7399538f9e7b965d461eee6fc30fe3fc0edbf50fa92ce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 230–249.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance DropWhile.instIterator [Monad m] [Iterator α m β] {P} :
    Iterator (DropWhile α m β P) m β where
  IsPlausibleStep := DropWhile.PlausibleStep
  step it := do
    match (← it.internalState.inner.step).inflate with
    | .yield it' out h =>
      if h' : it.internalState.dropping = true then
        match ← (P out).operation with
        | ⟨.up true, h''⟩ =>
          return .deflate <| .skip (IterM.Intermediate.dropWhileWithPostcondition P true it') (.dropped h h' h'')
        | ⟨.up false, h''⟩ =>
          return .deflate <| .yield (IterM.Intermediate.dropWhileWithPostcondition P false it') out (.start h h' h'')
      else
        return .deflate <| .yield (IterM.Intermediate.dropWhileWithPostcondition P false it') out
            (.yield h (Bool.not_eq_true _ ▸ h'))
    | .skip it' h =>
      return .deflate <| .skip (IterM.Intermediate.dropWhileWithPostcondition P it.internalState.dropping it') (.skip h)
    | .done h =>
      return .deflate <| .done (.done h)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DropWhile/Variant3f5bc71bf246ec37a490df7449a107d397529a29b2c7c50456fb3af9079ed77f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/DropWhile/Variant3f5bc71bf246ec37a490df7449a107d397529a29b2c7c50456fb3af9079ed77f.lean#L230).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ce8f532852b5e10e630a429e994839aae45b37c4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
