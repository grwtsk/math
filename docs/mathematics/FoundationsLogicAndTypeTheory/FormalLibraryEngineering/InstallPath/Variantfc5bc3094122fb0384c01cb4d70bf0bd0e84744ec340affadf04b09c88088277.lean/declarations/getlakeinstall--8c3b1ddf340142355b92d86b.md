## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:da03d7e5c7d242d9331315c4492c4292a40f5fa910629b4b8b9b59e9178e9241`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 353–370.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public def getLakeInstall? (lake : FilePath) : BaseIO (Option LakeInstall) := do
  let some home := lakeBuildHome? lake | return none
  let lake : LakeInstall := {home, lake}
  if (← lake.libDir / "Lake.olean" |>.pathExists) then
    return some lake
  return none

/--
Attempt to detect Lean's installation by using the `LEAN` and `LEAN_SYSROOT`
environment variables.

If `LEAN_SYSROOT` is set, use it. Otherwise, check `LEAN` for the `lean`
executable. If `LEAN` is set but empty, Lean will be considered disabled.
Otherwise, Lean's location will be determined by trying `findLeanSysroot?`
using value of `LEAN` or, if unset, the `lean` in `PATH`.

See `LeanInstall.get` for how it assumes the Lean install is organized.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/InstallPath/Variantfc5bc3094122fb0384c01cb4d70bf0bd0e84744ec340affadf04b09c88088277.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/InstallPath/Variantfc5bc3094122fb0384c01cb4d70bf0bd0e84744ec340affadf04b09c88088277.lean#L353).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3c7edde02ea196e47aae32845c1ff9985008a2da` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
