## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:80fdec52d51263cc1c5ed69890d39fc86e0aa77954b1f0d18033e2c38a5af32f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 225–238.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public def findElanInstall? : BaseIO (Option ElanInstall) := do
  if let some home ← IO.getEnv "ELAN_HOME" then
    let elan := (← IO.getEnv "ELAN").getD "elan"
    if elan.trimAscii.isEmpty then
      return none
    else
      return some {elan, home}
  return none

/--
Attempt to find the sysroot of the given `lean` command (if it exists)
by calling `lean --print-prefix` and returning the path it prints.
Defaults to trying the `lean` in `PATH`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/InstallPath/Variant2d8fa05a4736ccdbc30b9af5b0c252e23f1706f08675eaaa88d4de64004cffef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/InstallPath/Variant2d8fa05a4736ccdbc30b9af5b0c252e23f1706f08675eaaa88d4de64004cffef.lean#L225).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `73b0fc56e4fad9ea24520eea0b12685638bc05bf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
