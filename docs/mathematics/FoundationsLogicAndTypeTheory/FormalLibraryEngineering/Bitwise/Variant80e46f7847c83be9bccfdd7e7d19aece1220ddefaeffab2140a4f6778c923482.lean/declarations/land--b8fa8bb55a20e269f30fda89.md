## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1a514374e09e3ab22243ec2bfe8b9a763a1242be2b674e98a76b5acd9ac5781b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 292–298.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def land' : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ :=
  bitwise' and
#align nat.land Nat.land'

/--`ldiff' a b` performs bitwise set difference. For each corresponding
  pair of bits taken as booleans, say `aᵢ` and `bᵢ`, it applies the
  boolean operation `aᵢ ∧ bᵢ` to obtain the `iᵗʰ` bit of the result.-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Bitwise/Variant80e46f7847c83be9bccfdd7e7d19aece1220ddefaeffab2140a4f6778c923482.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Bitwise/Variant80e46f7847c83be9bccfdd7e7d19aece1220ddefaeffab2140a4f6778c923482.lean#L292).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0100d5f4f34fb54c1cd13a7744c4a27e60a3a67f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
