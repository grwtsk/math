## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3ded2305-d3a0-3e44-6372-9fe6038aa13a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 689–690.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] theorem UInt16.ofFin_shiftRight (a b : Fin UInt16.size) (hb : b.val < 16) : UInt16.ofFin (a >>> b) = UInt16.ofFin a >>> UInt16.ofFin b :=
  UInt16.toFin_inj.1 (by simp [UInt16.toFin_shiftRight (ofFin a) (ofFin b) hb])
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Bitwise/Variant93742e994f15a28efddb2905405e54244a5adfcc245d8bfe1e4ff47ee6396184.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Bitwise/Variant93742e994f15a28efddb2905405e54244a5adfcc245d8bfe1e4ff47ee6396184.lean#L689).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `28cff6606b591e9dcc1d1207c4b4d451d3378e45` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
