## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e10b9cadaa59536e1970a3a7c94b700a38706b35f5241660b273aa3a81b87262`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 583–605.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def handleEvalInterval (req : EvalRequest) : Json :=
  -- Convert raw box to IntervalEnv
  let intervals := req.box.toList.map RawInterval.toInterval
  let env : IntervalEnv := fun i => intervals.getD i (IntervalRat.singleton 0)

  -- Run computation using evaluator with division support
  let cfg : EvalConfig := { taylorDepth := req.taylorDepth }
  let result := evalIntervalCoreWithDiv req.expr env cfg

  -- Serialize result
  Json.mkObj [
    ("lo", toJson (toRawRat result.lo)),
    ("hi", toJson (toRawRat result.hi))
  ]

/-- Handle high-performance Dyadic interval evaluation request.

This evaluator uses Dyadic arithmetic (n * 2^e) instead of rationals,
preventing denominator explosion for deep expressions. It's 10-100x
faster for complex expressions like neural networks or nested Taylor series.

The result is returned both as Dyadic (exact) and as Rational (for
compatibility with the existing API). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Bridge/Variant220c758a389d1b42bbc0d20970e32515b43481b5555e9b495b1544e402d36920.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Bridge/Variant220c758a389d1b42bbc0d20970e32515b43481b5555e9b495b1544e402d36920.lean#L583).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5184af2a459a9ee0e3b81eef1221c21e11ccc4c2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
