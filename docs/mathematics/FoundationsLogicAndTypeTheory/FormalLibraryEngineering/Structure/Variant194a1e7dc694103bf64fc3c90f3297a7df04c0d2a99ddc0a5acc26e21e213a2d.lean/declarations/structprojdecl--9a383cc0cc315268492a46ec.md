## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:165cb9b9e1c65b997b0fd6dce44f77af5823becc58136d43a22d7ba1a1ee28a2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 33–49.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure StructProjDecl where
  ref : Syntax
  projName : Name
  /-- Overrides to param binders to apply after param binder info inference. -/
  paramInfoOverrides : List (Option BinderInfo) := []

/--
Adds projection functions to the environment for the one-constructor inductive type named `n`.
- The `projName`s in each `StructProjDecl` are used for the names of the declarations added to the environment.
- If `instImplicit` is true, then generates projections with `self` being instance implicit.

Notes:
- This function supports everything that `Expr.proj` supports (see `lean::type_checker::infer_proj`).
  This means we can generate projections for inductive types with one-constructor,
  even if it is an indexed family (which is not supported by the `structure` command).
- We throw errors in the cases that `Expr.proj` is not type-correct.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Structure/Variant194a1e7dc694103bf64fc3c90f3297a7df04c0d2a99ddc0a5acc26e21e213a2d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Structure/Variant194a1e7dc694103bf64fc3c90f3297a7df04c0d2a99ddc0a5acc26e21e213a2d.lean#L33).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `131b774c312459c025a2c4021f69ec6cb0b02045` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
