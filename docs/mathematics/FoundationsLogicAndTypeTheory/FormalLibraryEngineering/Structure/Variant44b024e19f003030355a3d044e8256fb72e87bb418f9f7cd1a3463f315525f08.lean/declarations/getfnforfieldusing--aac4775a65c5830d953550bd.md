## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f33a3195822756ae1a4928dedb803efec8e5d0128e7bd876eb0577f0e968337f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 305–317.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def getFnForFieldUsing? (mkName : Name → Name) (env : Environment) (structName : Name) (fieldName : Name) : Option Name :=
  if let some projName := getProjFnForField? env structName fieldName then
    let defFn := mkName projName
    if env.contains defFn then defFn else none
  else
    -- Check if we have a default function for a default values overridden by substructure.
    let defFn := mkName (structName ++ fieldName)
    if env.contains defFn then defFn else none

/--
Returns the name of the auxiliary definition that defines a default value for the field, if any such definition exists.
This is *not* an inherited default. We need to store provided defaults so that it is possible to resolve defaults according to the resolution order.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Structure/Variant44b024e19f003030355a3d044e8256fb72e87bb418f9f7cd1a3463f315525f08.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Structure/Variant44b024e19f003030355a3d044e8256fb72e87bb418f9f7cd1a3463f315525f08.lean#L305).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `abd489a9ac6813ceaa5176d860866eb94f5fd566` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
