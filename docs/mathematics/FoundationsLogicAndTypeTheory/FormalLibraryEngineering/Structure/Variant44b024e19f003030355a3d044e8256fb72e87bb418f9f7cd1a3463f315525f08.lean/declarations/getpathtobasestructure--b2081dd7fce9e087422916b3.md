## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2b94230184d60eaafb412b9cf7b641c9bd5494ffcd2bfff3692c1413d27363a9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 346–368.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def getPathToBaseStructure? (env : Environment) (baseStructName : Name) (structName : Name) : Option (List Name) :=
  OptionT.run (go structName []) |>.run' {}
where
  go (structName : Name) (path : List Name) : OptionT (StateM NameSet) (List Name) := do
    if baseStructName == structName then
      return path.reverse
    else
      guard <| !(← get).contains structName
      modify fun s => s.insert structName
      let some info := getStructureInfo? env structName | failure
      -- Prefer subobject projections
      (info.fieldInfo.firstM fun field => do
        let some parentStructName := field.subobject? | failure
        go parentStructName (field.projFn :: path))
      -- Otherwise, consider other parents
      <|> info.parentInfo.firstM fun parent => do
        go parent.structName (parent.projFn :: path)

/--
Returns true iff `constName` is a non-recursive inductive datatype that has only one constructor and no indices.

Such types have special kernel support (e.g. the eta rule). This must be in sync with `is_non_rec_structure()`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Structure/Variant44b024e19f003030355a3d044e8256fb72e87bb418f9f7cd1a3463f315525f08.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Structure/Variant44b024e19f003030355a3d044e8256fb72e87bb418f9f7cd1a3463f315525f08.lean#L346).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `abd489a9ac6813ceaa5176d860866eb94f5fd566` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
