## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a083815f3db3f91602404445b1bc9b12709bff2c6deb65e12eee814e27529d9a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1492–1507.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def checkResolutionOrder (structName : Name) : TermElabM Unit := do
  let resolutionOrderResult ← computeStructureResolutionOrder structName (relaxed := !structure.strictResolutionOrder.get (← getOptions))
  trace[Elab.structure.resolutionOrder] "computed resolution order: {resolutionOrderResult.resolutionOrder}"
  unless resolutionOrderResult.conflicts.isEmpty do
    let mut defects : List MessageData := []
    for conflict in resolutionOrderResult.conflicts do
      let parentKind direct := if direct then "parent" else "indirect parent"
      let conflicts := conflict.conflicts.map fun (isDirect, name) =>
        m!"{parentKind isDirect} `{MessageData.ofConstName name}`"
      defects := m!"- {parentKind conflict.isDirectParent} `{MessageData.ofConstName conflict.badParent}` \
        must come after {MessageData.andList conflicts.toList}" :: defects
    logWarning m!"Failed to compute strict resolution order:\n{MessageData.joinSep defects.reverse "\n"}"

/--
Adds each direct parent projection to a class as an instance, so long as the parent isn't an ancestor of the others.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Structure/Variant283064a7fd3fb6d650ea5670cf26108df06fe96aa6d03baf982a58164ea8e0ea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Structure/Variant283064a7fd3fb6d650ea5670cf26108df06fe96aa6d03baf982a58164ea8e0ea.lean#L1492).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a1c91bd6fe151224d413a2c083e3d0385d2386eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
