## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:547dde0cda7c9bf9dbefdb5c6ee8567cc18abcc6fb193721825ca1535d723bf3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 197–209.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def findField? (env : Environment) (structName : Name) (fieldName : Name) : Option Name :=
  if (getStructureFields env structName).contains fieldName then
    some structName
  else
    getStructureSubobjects env structName |>.findSome? (findField? env · fieldName)

/--
Given a structure `structName` and a parent projection name `projName` (e.g. `toParentStructName`),
returns the corresponding parent structure name.
The parent projection name is a single-component name.

Note: this relies on the fact that projection names are checked to be consistent across all parents.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Structure/Variantefb642c4ba81cda9af92374cc48e776ebad991faf16161ca71b6c1bda3b82671.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Structure/Variantefb642c4ba81cda9af92374cc48e776ebad991faf16161ca71b6c1bda3b82671.lean#L197).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77e580c4e57be3c5a26bc3411947584e07cb1098` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
