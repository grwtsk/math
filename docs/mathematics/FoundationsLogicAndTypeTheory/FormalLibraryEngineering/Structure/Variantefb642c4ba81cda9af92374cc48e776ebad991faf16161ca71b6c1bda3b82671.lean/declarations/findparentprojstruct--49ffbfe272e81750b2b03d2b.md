## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e72c7ca4d663be74a6a4d00ba7b25394e0d8c40777a1868a7fd581b3a26a6e68`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 210–235.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def findParentProjStruct? (env : Environment) (structName : Name) (projName : Name) : Option Name :=
  go structName |>.run' {}
where
  -- Use a cache to navigate the DAG in polynomial time
  go (structName : Name) : StateM NameSet (Option Name) := do
    if (← get).contains structName then
      return none
    else
      let parentInfos := getStructureParentInfo env structName
      if let some parentInfo := parentInfos.find? (projName.isSuffixOf ·.projFn) then
        return some parentInfo.structName
      else
        modify fun s => s.insert structName
        parentInfos.findSomeM? (go ·.structName)

/--
Gets the name for a structure constructor where the fields have been fully flattened.
This constructor simulates a flat representation for structures,
and it is used by structure instance notation when elaborating structure fields
and for organizing the fields into subobjects.

The body of the flat constructor has the following properties (recursively):
- the fields come in order
- for subobject fields, the value is the unfolded flat constructor for that field
- for standard fields, the value is one of the flat constructor parameters
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Structure/Variantefb642c4ba81cda9af92374cc48e776ebad991faf16161ca71b6c1bda3b82671.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/Structure/Variantefb642c4ba81cda9af92374cc48e776ebad991faf16161ca71b6c1bda3b82671.lean#L210).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77e580c4e57be3c5a26bc3411947584e07cb1098` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
