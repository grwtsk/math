## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `macro` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1d975aa08794c11fb3fb421c50a203dda64a20c40d6bf143defbbe7a45060f4e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 208–213.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
macro (name := ring) "ring" : tactic =>
  `(tactic| first | ring1 | try_this ring_nf
  "\n\nThe `ring` tactic failed to close the goal. Use `ring_nf` to obtain a normal form.
  \nNote that `ring` works primarily in *commutative* rings. \
  If you have a noncommutative ring, abelian group or module, consider using \
  `noncomm_ring`, `abel` or `module` instead.")
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RingNF/Variant31153746c1e6d63deb4b0eaec3f14c26cbd859a023415c27870a9a3ac7133e80.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/FormalLibraryEngineering/RingNF/Variant31153746c1e6d63deb4b0eaec3f14c26cbd859a023415c27870a9a3ac7133e80.lean#L208).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `72bc943d94750b206fb2f4ebaf7260a9279eee63` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
