## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4e3dc3c3-9ac1-6a5a-cb5e-6ffc907e1381`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 796–800.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem neg_strictAnti : StrictAnti (- · : EReal → EReal) :=
  WithBot.strictAnti_iff.2 ⟨WithTop.strictAnti_iff.2
    ⟨coe_strictMono.comp_strictAnti fun _ _ => neg_lt_neg, fun _ => bot_lt_coe _⟩,
      WithTop.forall.2 ⟨bot_lt_top, fun _ => coe_lt_top _⟩⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/EReal/Variantdb0f6a26ed1aca7de6cff7fbda0426729e878746d9120e7362394445d95126a9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/EReal/Variantdb0f6a26ed1aca7de6cff7fbda0426729e878746d9120e7362394445d95126a9.lean#L796).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `22162629622a034cab326979ca4012e9d717b37f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
