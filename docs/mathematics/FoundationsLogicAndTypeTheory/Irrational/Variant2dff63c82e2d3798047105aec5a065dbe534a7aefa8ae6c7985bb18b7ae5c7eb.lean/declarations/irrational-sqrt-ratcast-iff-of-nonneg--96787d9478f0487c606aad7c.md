## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:98b0e96b-8432-52d9-238c-49b93c89e4d4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 103–112.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem irrational_sqrt_ratCast_iff_of_nonneg {q : ℚ} (hq : 0 ≤ q) :
    Irrational (√q) ↔ ¬IsSquare q := by
  refine Iff.not (?_ : Exists _ ↔ Exists _)
  constructor
  · rintro ⟨y, hy⟩
    refine ⟨y, Rat.cast_injective (α := ℝ) ?_⟩
    rw [Rat.cast_mul, hy, mul_self_sqrt (Rat.cast_nonneg.2 hq)]
  · rintro ⟨q', rfl⟩
    exact ⟨|q'|, mod_cast (sqrt_mul_self_eq_abs q').symm⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Irrational/Variant2dff63c82e2d3798047105aec5a065dbe534a7aefa8ae6c7985bb18b7ae5c7eb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Irrational/Variant2dff63c82e2d3798047105aec5a065dbe534a7aefa8ae6c7985bb18b7ae5c7eb.lean#L103).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a264b41b868409109de58f2d3190364ed62ab8d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
