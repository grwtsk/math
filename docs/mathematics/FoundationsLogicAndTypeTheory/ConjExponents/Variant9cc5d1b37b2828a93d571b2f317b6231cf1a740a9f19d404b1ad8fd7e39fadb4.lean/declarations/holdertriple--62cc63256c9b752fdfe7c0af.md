## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a2e7590616934a6f6a53d527a414de5e4a50569b67e0b72cf8af0106f6935e1c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–53.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure HolderTriple (p q r : ℝ) : Prop where
  inv_add_inv_eq_inv : p⁻¹ + q⁻¹ = r⁻¹
  left_pos : 0 < p
  right_pos : 0 < q

/-- Real numbers `p q : ℝ` are **Hölder conjugate** if they are positive and satisfy the
equality `p⁻¹ + q⁻¹ = 1`. This is an abbreviation for `Real.HolderTriple p q 1`. This condition
shows up in many theorems in analysis, notably related to `L^p` norms.

It is equivalent that `1 < p` and `p⁻¹ + q⁻¹ = 1`. See `Real.holderConjugate_iff`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ConjExponents/Variant9cc5d1b37b2828a93d571b2f317b6231cf1a740a9f19d404b1ad8fd7e39fadb4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ConjExponents/Variant9cc5d1b37b2828a93d571b2f317b6231cf1a740a9f19d404b1ad8fd7e39fadb4.lean#L44).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4aa41cbb45aba249c0ad570ddba9ac8da6a50574` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
