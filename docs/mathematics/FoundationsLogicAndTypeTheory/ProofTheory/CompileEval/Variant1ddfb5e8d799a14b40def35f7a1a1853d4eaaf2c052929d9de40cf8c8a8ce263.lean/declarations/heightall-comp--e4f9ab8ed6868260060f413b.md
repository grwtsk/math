## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f731edef-3334-d21e-4425-142c1850a4db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 322–350.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
  private theorem heightAll_comp
      {K : KernelPresentation.{u}} {js : List K.Judgment}
      (children : IndexedAll (RawDer K) js) :
      TreePlan.heightAll (compAll children) = RawDer.heightAll children := by
    cases children with
    | nil => rfl
    | cons head tail =>
        simp only [compAll, TreePlan.heightAll, RawDer.heightAll]
        rw [height_comp head, heightAll_comp tail]
end

/--
**Used by:** `CompB` and internal-reference diagnostics.

**Equality notion:** Exact equality of finite sets of presentation constant
names, including internal project names.

**Validation consequence:** Compilation cannot hide or invent a constant
reference in the abstract tree model.

**Architectural problem:** Internal references must survive planning exactly.
**Important data and indices:** Both finite sets use `K.ConstantName` at root `J`.
**Type-enforced invariant:** `Comp` retains every indexed node inspected by accounting.
**Layer boundary:** Equality is local accounting, not global dependency closure.
**Worked example:** `Project.helper` occurs on both sides for the private fixture.
**Proof idea:** Unfold plan accounting and apply `eval_comp`.
**Boundary cases:** Empty reference sets remain empty.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/CompileEval/Variant1ddfb5e8d799a14b40def35f7a1a1853d4eaaf2c052929d9de40cf8c8a8ce263.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/CompileEval/Variant1ddfb5e8d799a14b40def35f7a1a1853d4eaaf2c052929d9de40cf8c8a8ce263.lean#L322).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5d4c9d2dd6e90a8f9467601f7e0df00e46faa147` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
