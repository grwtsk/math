## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:234db09f49490d6b96e76176c26c138e1c00431d12acfa94d19cc6be25c08403`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 317–344.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ProofPreservationClaim
    {source : Theory.{uSO, uSP}}
    {target : Theory.{uTO, uTP}}
    {sourceFoundation targetFoundation : Foundation}
    {sourceVersion : MathematicalTheoryVersion source sourceFoundation}
    {targetVersion : MathematicalTheoryVersion target targetFoundation}
    {sourceAssumptions : AssumptionSet source}
    {targetAssumptions : AssumptionSet target}
    {sourceScope : TransferScope source}
    {targetScope : TransferScope target}
    (translation : Translation source target sourceVersion targetVersion
      sourceAssumptions targetAssumptions sourceScope targetScope)
    (sourceTheorem : CertifiedTheorem sourceVersion sourceAssumptions)
    (targetTheorem : CertifiedTheorem targetVersion targetAssumptions) where
  evidenceArtifact : VersionId
  targetPropositionExact : targetTheorem.proposition =
    translation.mapProposition sourceTheorem.proposition
  encodeProof : source.ProofObject sourceTheorem.proposition →
    target.ProofObject targetTheorem.proposition
  decodeProof : target.ProofObject targetTheorem.proposition →
    source.ProofObject sourceTheorem.proposition
  sourceProofRoundTrip : ∀ proofObject,
    decodeProof (encodeProof proofObject) = proofObject
  certifiedProofExact : ∀ sourceAssumptionsHold targetAssumptionsHold,
    encodeProof (sourceTheorem.proofObject sourceAssumptionsHold) =
      targetTheorem.proofObject targetAssumptionsHold

/-- Syntactic status requires a durable, nonempty external evidence inventory. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/Derivation/Variantf5304fd3c472bbd035b7f183afafd1d8bd52da39318860c6b90e638eee1d6936.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/Derivation/Variantf5304fd3c472bbd035b7f183afafd1d8bd52da39318860c6b90e638eee1d6936.lean#L317).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `41cd029be2cacea36e5b3716963b31ff5d717fb5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
