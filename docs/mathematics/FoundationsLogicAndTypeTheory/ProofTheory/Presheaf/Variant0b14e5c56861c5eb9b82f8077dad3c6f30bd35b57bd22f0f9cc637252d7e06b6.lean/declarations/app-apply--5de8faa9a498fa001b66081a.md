## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ca460fd3-70d9-9d43-54ee-f31c5cae1076`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 149–158.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma app_apply (d : M.Derivation' φ') {X : Dᵒᵖ} (b : R.obj X) :
    (d.app X).d b = d.d b := rfl

section

variable (d : ∀ (X : Dᵒᵖ), (M.obj X).Derivation (φ'.app X))

/-- Given a morphism of presheaves of commutative rings `φ'`, this is the
in derivation `M.Derivation' φ'` that is given by a compatible family of derivations
with values in the modules `M.obj X` for all `X`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/Presheaf/Variant0b14e5c56861c5eb9b82f8077dad3c6f30bd35b57bd22f0f9cc637252d7e06b6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/Presheaf/Variant0b14e5c56861c5eb9b82f8077dad3c6f30bd35b57bd22f0f9cc637252d7e06b6.lean#L149).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `df75f7318a0696a5ab1220ad92134ef1b781d417` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
