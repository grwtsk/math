## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:eb8b24b9e539238552455ff31e9c8ccb3b1480ffc61ff72b37d66558dcf1078a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def postcomp (f : M ⟶ N) : N.Derivation φ where
  d := (f.app _).hom.toAddMonoidHom.comp d.d
  d_map {X Y} g x := by simpa using naturality_apply f g (d.d x)
  d_app {X} a := by
    dsimp
    erw [d_app]
    rw [map_zero]

/-- The universal property that a derivation `d : M.Derivation φ` must
satisfy so that the presheaf of modules `M` can be considered as the presheaf of
(relative) differentials of a presheaf of commutative rings `φ : S ⟶ F.op ⋙ R`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/Presheaf/Variant3b6824d3d08dc3fc720ff9a7e56602fd0a31973df66c40a55dfb36d2f766c36a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/Presheaf/Variant3b6824d3d08dc3fc720ff9a7e56602fd0a31973df66c40a55dfb36d2f766c36a.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3a6795c05ab1a9d1f0676b40d881dc45c08362d3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
