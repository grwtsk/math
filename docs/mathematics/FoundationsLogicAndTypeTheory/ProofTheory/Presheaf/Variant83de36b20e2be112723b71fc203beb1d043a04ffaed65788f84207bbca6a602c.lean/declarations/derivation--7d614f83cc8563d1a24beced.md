## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8a8889e3f18987096acd7d5fb1aa0f33473911657bfbb25ccc961d85a031f6d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 65–80.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Derivation where
  /-- the underlying additive map `R.obj X →+ M.obj X` of a derivation -/
  d {X : Dᵒᵖ} : R.obj X →+ M.obj X
  d_mul {X : Dᵒᵖ} (a b : R.obj X) : d (a * b) = a • d b + b • d a := by cat_disch
  d_map {X Y : Dᵒᵖ} (f : X ⟶ Y) (x : R.obj X) :
    d (R.map f x) = M.map f (d x) := by cat_disch
  d_app {X : Cᵒᵖ} (a : S.obj X) : d (φ.app X a) = 0 := by cat_disch

namespace Derivation

-- Note: `d_app` cannot be a simp lemma because `dsimp` would
-- simplify the composition of functors `R ⋙ forget₂ _ _`
attribute [simp] d_mul d_map

variable {M N φ}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/Presheaf/Variant83de36b20e2be112723b71fc203beb1d043a04ffaed65788f84207bbca6a602c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/Presheaf/Variant83de36b20e2be112723b71fc203beb1d043a04ffaed65788f84207bbca6a602c.lean#L65).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a523d59b7c91120450ed1474a7d7a1b96d9e51a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
