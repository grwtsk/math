## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5f01e7cac613fc216c44a0676900cc2d746901eb94143ade3d6ad3bbfac93c30`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 36–49.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def graphConsequenceTheoryArtifact
    {Input : Type uInput} {Witness : Type uWitness}
    {Coordinate : Type uCoordinate} {Edge : Type uMaterializedEdge}
    (profile : IntervalProfile Input Witness)
    (specification : SieveSpecification Coordinate)
    (graph : CoordinateGraph .Materialized Coordinate Edge) : VersionId :=
  VersionId.composite (eraseArtifactVersion profile.version)
    (VersionId.composite (eraseArtifactVersion specification.version)
      (eraseArtifactVersion graph.version))

/--
A graph proposition retains endpoint metadata, but its opaque `Prop` semantics
is conservatively assigned universal coordinate support.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/FCRSFullDerivation/Variant51c00dfa30f646277abd6362163b5b8b161a2bd1f21450dba91e7cc601ffa784.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/FCRSFullDerivation/Variant51c00dfa30f646277abd6362163b5b8b161a2bd1f21450dba91e7cc601ffa784.lean#L36).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f52cb44ef4293b47f08c80fb785a9d8f6e197db7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
