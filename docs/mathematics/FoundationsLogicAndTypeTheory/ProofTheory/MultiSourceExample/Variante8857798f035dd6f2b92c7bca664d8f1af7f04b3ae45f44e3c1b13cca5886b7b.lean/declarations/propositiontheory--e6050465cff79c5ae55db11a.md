## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9c6bfb00871c9c7180251a01962eb51ffbd4a459e2b8a073c6f1bba8e3034b00`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 34–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def propositionTheory (Object : Type) : Theory where
  Object := Object
  Proposition := Prop
  Holds := id
  ProofObject := fun proposition => PLift proposition
  proofObjectSound := fun proof => proof.down
  reifyProofObject := fun proof => ⟨proof⟩
  propositionSupport := fun _ => .universal
  propositionProperty := fun proposition _ => proposition

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/MultiSourceExample/Variante8857798f035dd6f2b92c7bca664d8f1af7f04b3ae45f44e3c1b13cca5886b7b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/MultiSourceExample/Variante8857798f035dd6f2b92c7bca664d8f1af7f04b3ae45f44e3c1b13cca5886b7b.lean#L34).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac2afd2a94950a8c5ac07d817908762231a5f4cc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
