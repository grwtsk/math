## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8b36eb38d8d65ba9a656cd9243aca91c55ee876f1285416898f5fb1296a8047f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 227–240.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Bracket (LeftInvariantDerivation I G) (LeftInvariantDerivation I G) where
  bracket X Y :=
    ⟨⁅(X : Derivation 𝕜 C^∞⟮I, G; 𝕜⟯ C^∞⟮I, G; 𝕜⟯), Y⁆, fun g => by
      ext f
      have hX := Derivation.congr_fun (left_invariant' g X) (Y f)
      have hY := Derivation.congr_fun (left_invariant' g Y) (X f)
      rw [hfdifferential_apply, fdifferential_apply, Derivation.evalAt_apply] at hX hY ⊢
      rw [comp_L] at hX hY
      rw [Derivation.commutator_apply, ContMDiffMap.coe_sub, Pi.sub_apply, coe_derivation]
      rw [coe_derivation] at hX hY ⊢
      rw [hX, hY]
      rfl⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/LeftInvariantDerivation/Variant6bc9dfdd3a57cb55bbc718f1d508892ab59a7a159718f002c95aa195036aff1a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ProofTheory/LeftInvariantDerivation/Variant6bc9dfdd3a57cb55bbc718f1d508892ab59a7a159718f002c95aa195036aff1a.lean#L227).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `373c5b752b9aa65aaf13874e084127eb2aa7c28e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
