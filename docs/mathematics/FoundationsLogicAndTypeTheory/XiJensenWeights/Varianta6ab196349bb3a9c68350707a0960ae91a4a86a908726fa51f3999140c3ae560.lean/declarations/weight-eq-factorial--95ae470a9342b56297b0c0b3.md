## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5b99878b-fd39-4a68-4d38-b8756fe77276`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 30–41.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem weight_eq_factorial {n k : ℕ} (hk : k ≤ n) :
    weight n k = ((2 * n).factorial : ℝ) /
      (((2 * n - 2 * k).factorial : ℝ) * (2 * (n : ℝ)) ^ (2 * k)) := by
  have hf : ((2 * n - 2 * k).factorial : ℝ) ≠ 0 := by positivity
  have h := congrArg (fun a : ℕ => (a : ℝ))
    (Nat.factorial_mul_descFactorial (show 2 * k ≤ 2 * n by omega))
  simp only [Nat.cast_mul] at h
  unfold weight
  rw [← h]
  field_simp

/-- The leading weight retains its exact nonzero factorial normalization. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/XiJensenWeights/Varianta6ab196349bb3a9c68350707a0960ae91a4a86a908726fa51f3999140c3ae560.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/XiJensenWeights/Varianta6ab196349bb3a9c68350707a0960ae91a4a86a908726fa51f3999140c3ae560.lean#L30).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2b6e4923b3ba46a904bb17c43a0b5b8ec2f80a8c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
