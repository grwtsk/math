## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:62e2431d58622d89001ad7f1a215935161212653589d1658909dc8579fe766c9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 334–342.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def sigmaSumDistrib {ι} (α β : ι → Type*) :
    (Σ i, α i ⊕ β i) ≃ (Σ i, α i) ⊕ (Σ i, β i) :=
  ⟨fun p => p.2.map (Sigma.mk p.1) (Sigma.mk p.1),
    Sum.elim (Sigma.map id fun _ => Sum.inl) (Sigma.map id fun _ => Sum.inr), fun p => by
    rcases p with ⟨i, a | b⟩ <;> rfl, fun p => by rcases p with (⟨i, a⟩ | ⟨i, b⟩) <;> rfl⟩

/-- A type indexed by  disjoint sums of types is equivalent to the sum of the sums. Compare with
`Equiv.sigmaSumDistrib` which has the sums as the output type. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Sum/Variant941f31813d7a7e2fd9d285bbccf42eccec7498b7379d64c49652c2269ad9f316.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Sum/Variant941f31813d7a7e2fd9d285bbccf42eccec7498b7379d64c49652c2269ad9f316.lean#L334).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5a4972bd90000423db62023f5ffddf29afef7531` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
