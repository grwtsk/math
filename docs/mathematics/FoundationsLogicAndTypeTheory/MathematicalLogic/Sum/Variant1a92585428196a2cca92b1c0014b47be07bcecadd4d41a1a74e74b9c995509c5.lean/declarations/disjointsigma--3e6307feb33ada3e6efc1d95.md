## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3967de0482e1b423eac3551ed57851235c60a784b795d15352a52766f0606b45`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 197–201.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def disjointSigma (M : ι → Matroid α) (h : Pairwise (Disjoint on fun i ↦ (M i).E)) :
    Matroid α :=
  (Matroid.sigma (fun i ↦ (M i).restrictSubtype (M i).E)).mapEmbedding
    (Function.Embedding.sigmaSet h)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Sum/Variant1a92585428196a2cca92b1c0014b47be07bcecadd4d41a1a74e74b9c995509c5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Sum/Variant1a92585428196a2cca92b1c0014b47be07bcecadd4d41a1a74e74b9c995509c5.lean#L197).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9c2f8c90275251f9b5bdbfa261aee2efef0d9c91` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
