## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6a57c89b-6e3a-3194-d68e-b31403f87e76`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 536–560.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma MDifferentiableWithinAt.sum_section_of_locallyFinite
    (ht : LocallyFinite fun i ↦ {x : B | t i x ≠ 0})
    (ht' : ∀ i, MDiffAt[u] (T% (t i ·)) x₀) :
    MDiffAt[u] (T% (fun x ↦ ∑' i, (t i x))) x₀ := by
  obtain ⟨u', hu', hfin⟩ := ht x₀
  -- All sections `t i` but a finite set `s` vanish near `x₀`: choose a neighbourhood `u` of `x₀`
  -- and a finite set `s` of sections which don't vanish.
  let s := {i | ((fun i ↦ {x | t i x ≠ 0}) i ∩ u').Nonempty}
  have := hfin.fintype
  have : MDiffAt[u ∩ u'] (T% (fun x ↦ ∑ i ∈ s, (t i x))) x₀ :=

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/MDifferentiable/Variant757a53e79e78cfc452224fd761a3b92ce94dcd90907a13194cd242303140189d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/MDifferentiable/Variant757a53e79e78cfc452224fd761a3b92ce94dcd90907a13194cd242303140189d.lean#L536).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1dbddb9c92d0b28a17ea483b67f12d4fb1ab9031` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
