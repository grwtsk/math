## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0379abc59d52a736fe3b14892c4b1d80d1891c0b5f43c2a15e08ca20b72e4da1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 53–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Units (α : Type u) [Monoid α] where
  /-- The underlying value in the base `Monoid`. -/
  val : α
  /-- The inverse value of `val` in the base `Monoid`. -/
  inv : α
  /-- `inv` is the right inverse of `val` in the base `Monoid`. -/
  val_inv : val * inv = 1
  /-- `inv` is the left inverse of `val` in the base `Monoid`. -/
  inv_val : inv * val = 1
#align units Units
#align units.val Units.val
#align units.inv Units.inv
#align units.val_inv Units.val_inv
#align units.inv_val Units.inv_val

postfix:1024 "ˣ" => Units

-- We don't provide notation for the additive version, because its use is somewhat rare.
/-- Units of an `AddMonoid`, bundled version.

An element of an `AddMonoid` is a unit if it has a two-sided additive inverse.
This version bundles the inverse element so that it can be computed.
For a predicate see `isAddUnit`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Units/Variant0413b02ef9f0b9304e53713d9bac9adccbd7b0444809a538d9202ec3a83db038.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Units/Variant0413b02ef9f0b9304e53713d9bac9adccbd7b0444809a538d9202ec3a83db038.lean#L53).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d1e6f0ca0aa1726c564c4812e096fc5896550357` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
