## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2cbbe93a-15f2-f548-e85e-f05f6a6e9e6e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–152.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem formPerm_subsingleton (s : Cycle α) (h : Subsingleton s) : formPerm s h.nodup = 1 := by
  induction' s using Quot.inductionOn with s
  simp only [formPerm_coe, mk_eq_coe]
  simp only [length_subsingleton_iff, length_coe, mk_eq_coe] at h
  obtain - | ⟨hd, tl⟩ := s
  · simp
  · simp only [length_eq_zero_iff, add_le_iff_nonpos_left, List.length, nonpos_iff_eq_zero] at h
    simp [h]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Concrete/Variant3b9d9270cc3d69fe03df149a873ae2900a28fb79820b98c1fa79a4a780cd043e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Concrete/Variant3b9d9270cc3d69fe03df149a873ae2900a28fb79820b98c1fa79a4a780cd043e.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `06b8bae76257c7caee1081235525ebd26450cdc6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
