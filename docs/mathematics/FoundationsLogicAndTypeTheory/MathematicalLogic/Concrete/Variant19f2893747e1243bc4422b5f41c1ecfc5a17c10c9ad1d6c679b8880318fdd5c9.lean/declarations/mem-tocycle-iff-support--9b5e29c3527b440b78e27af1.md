## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f5aa09a7-9abf-d37d-c086-fd5a877c2e11`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 393–405.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_toCycle_iff_support (f : Perm α) (hf : f.IsCycle) : x ∈ f.toCycle hf ↔ f x ≠ x := by
  constructor
  · have ⟨l, hl⟩ := exists_toCycle_toList f hf
    simp only [hl, Cycle.mem_coe_iff, ne_eq]
    intro h
    have ⟨h1, h2⟩ := mem_toList_iff.mp h
    exact ((isCycle_iff_sameCycle (mem_support.mp h2)).mp (y := x) hf).mp h1
  · intro h
    simp only [toCycle_eq_toList f hf x h, Cycle.mem_coe_iff, toList, mem_iterate, iterate_eq_pow]
    use 0
    exact ⟨by simpa, by simp⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Concrete/Variant19f2893747e1243bc4422b5f41c1ecfc5a17c10c9ad1d6c679b8880318fdd5c9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Concrete/Variant19f2893747e1243bc4422b5f41c1ecfc5a17c10c9ad1d6c679b8880318fdd5c9.lean#L393).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7551ce1829b3bfead94ce5f8325fa18d18ebb515` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
