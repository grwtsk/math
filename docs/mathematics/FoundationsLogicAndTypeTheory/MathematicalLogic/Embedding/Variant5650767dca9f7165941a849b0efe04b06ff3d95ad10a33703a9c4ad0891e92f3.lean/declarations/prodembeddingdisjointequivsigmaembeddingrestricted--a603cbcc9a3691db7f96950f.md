## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2650c8a21c75fe13cd3067903a6177762c518bee71cff812942a7b03a6da2f95`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–86.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def prodEmbeddingDisjointEquivSigmaEmbeddingRestricted {α β γ : Type*} :
    { f : (α ↪ γ) × (β ↪ γ) // Disjoint (Set.range f.1) (Set.range f.2) } ≃
      Σ f : α ↪ γ, β ↪ ↥(Set.range f)ᶜ :=
  (subtypeProdEquivSigmaSubtype fun (a : α ↪ γ) (b : β ↪ _) =>
        Disjoint (Set.range a) (Set.range b)).trans <|
    Equiv.sigmaCongrRight fun a =>
      (subtypeEquivProp <| by
            ext f
            rw [← Set.range_subset_iff, Set.subset_compl_iff_disjoint_right, disjoint_comm]).trans
        (codRestrict _ _)

/-- A combination of the above results, allowing us to turn one embedding over a sum type
into two dependent embeddings, the second of which avoids any members of the range
of the first. This is helpful for constructing larger embeddings out of smaller ones. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Embedding/Variant5650767dca9f7165941a849b0efe04b06ff3d95ad10a33703a9c4ad0891e92f3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Embedding/Variant5650767dca9f7165941a849b0efe04b06ff3d95ad10a33703a9c4ad0891e92f3.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f0913d24d011339d530158edf413c675331a93d1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
