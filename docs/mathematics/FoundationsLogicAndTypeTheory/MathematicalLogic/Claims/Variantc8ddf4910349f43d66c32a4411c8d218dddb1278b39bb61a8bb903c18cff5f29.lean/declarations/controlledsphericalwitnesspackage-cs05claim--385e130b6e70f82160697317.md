## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:35045f87-100a-4659-ead8-3f79ea3f46d3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 227–234.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ControlledSphericalWitnessPackage.cs05Claim
    {S : RealizationSystem.{uObj, uHom}}
    {M : ControlledPlaneModel.{uObj, uHom, vObj, vHom, uData} S}
    {SM : ControlledSphericalModel S M}
    (W : ControlledSphericalWitnessPackage S M SM) : CS05Claim W :=
  W.selectedVertexCompatibility

/-- Selected-carrier compactness discharges the branch-relative CS-06 claim. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Claims/Variantc8ddf4910349f43d66c32a4411c8d218dddb1278b39bb61a8bb903c18cff5f29.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Claims/Variantc8ddf4910349f43d66c32a4411c8d218dddb1278b39bb61a8bb903c18cff5f29.lean#L227).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `df12ebcd950ec40ec4a54236d0679bb99f5fa5dd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
