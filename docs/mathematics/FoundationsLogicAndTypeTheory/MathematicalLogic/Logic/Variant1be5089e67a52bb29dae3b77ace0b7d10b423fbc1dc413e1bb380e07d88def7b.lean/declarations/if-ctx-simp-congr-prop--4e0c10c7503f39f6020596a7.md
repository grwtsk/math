## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bcc5f0fc-c8a5-00d5-da17-05f7cf8a0931`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 398–404.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem if_ctx_simp_congr_prop {b c x y u v : Prop} [Decidable b] (h_c : b ↔ c) (h_t : c → (x ↔ u))
    -- FIXME: after https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/1867 is fixed,
    -- this should be changed back to:
    -- (h_e : ¬c → (y ↔ v)) : ite b x y ↔ ite c (h := decidable_of_decidable_of_iff h_c) u v :=
    (h_e : ¬c → (y ↔ v)) : ite b x y ↔ @ite _ c (decidable_of_decidable_of_iff h_c) u v :=
  if_ctx_congr_prop (dec_c := decidable_of_decidable_of_iff h_c) h_c h_t h_e

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Logic/Variant1be5089e67a52bb29dae3b77ace0b7d10b423fbc1dc413e1bb380e07d88def7b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Logic/Variant1be5089e67a52bb29dae3b77ace0b7d10b423fbc1dc413e1bb380e07d88def7b.lean#L398).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `64d685ebc939acc1947b1735460f92033e858d10` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
