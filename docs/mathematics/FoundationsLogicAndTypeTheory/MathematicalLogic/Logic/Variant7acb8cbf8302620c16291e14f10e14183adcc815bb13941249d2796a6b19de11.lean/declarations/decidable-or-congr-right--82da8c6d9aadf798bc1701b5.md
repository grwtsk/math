## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e5dde9b2-431a-27af-aac9-e23cc52d2379`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 657–663.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Decidable.or_congr_right' [Decidable a] (h : ¬a → (b ↔ c)) : a ∨ b ↔ a ∨ c := by
  rw [or_iff_not_imp_left, or_iff_not_imp_left]; exact imp_congr_right h

/-- Transfer decidability of `a` to decidability of `b`, if the propositions are equivalent.
**Important**: this function should be used instead of `rw` on `decidable b`, because the
kernel will get stuck reducing the usage of `propext` otherwise,
and `dec_trivial` will not work. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Logic/Variant7acb8cbf8302620c16291e14f10e14183adcc815bb13941249d2796a6b19de11.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Logic/Variant7acb8cbf8302620c16291e14f10e14183adcc815bb13941249d2796a6b19de11.lean#L657).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `96fcef5206ebe43f41d4492cd7e5e8b4719a940a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
