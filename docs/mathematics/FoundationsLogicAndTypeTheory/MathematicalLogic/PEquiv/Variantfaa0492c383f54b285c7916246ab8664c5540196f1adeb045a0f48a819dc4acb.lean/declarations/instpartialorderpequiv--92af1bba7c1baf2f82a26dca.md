## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:18bf202b8d404882ef92f74074bf8e5d29e41929832ea7c8cfb759673f1ed119`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 422–433.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instPartialOrderPEquiv : PartialOrder (α ≃. β) where
  le f g := ∀ (a : α) (b : β), b ∈ f a → b ∈ g a
  le_refl _ _ _ := id
  le_trans f g h fg gh a b := gh a b ∘ fg a b
  le_antisymm f g fg gf :=
    ext
      (by
        intro a
        cases' h : g a with b
        · exact eq_none_iff_forall_not_mem.2 fun b hb => Option.not_mem_none b <| h ▸ fg a b hb
        · exact gf _ _ h)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/PEquiv/Variantfaa0492c383f54b285c7916246ab8664c5540196f1adeb045a0f48a819dc4acb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/PEquiv/Variantfaa0492c383f54b285c7916246ab8664c5540196f1adeb045a0f48a819dc4acb.lean#L422).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5626d197306255aea4887c963514dc9a80922f13` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
