## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `elab` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:85f2465abdf727aec25d0f0dc43d67b905d36185828ac54e5796a72785794bfc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
elab (name := mfldSetTac) "mfld_set_tac" : tactic => withMainContext do
  let g ← getMainGoal
  let goalTy := (← instantiateMVars (← g.getDecl).type).getAppFnArgs
  match goalTy with
  | (``Eq, #[_ty, _e₁, _e₂]) =>
    evalTactic (← `(tactic| (
      apply Set.ext; intro my_y
      constructor <;>
        · intro h_my_y
          try simp only [*, mfld_simps] at h_my_y
          try simp only [*, mfld_simps])))
  | (``Subset, #[_ty, _inst, _e₁, _e₂]) =>
    evalTactic (← `(tactic| (
      intro my_y h_my_y
      try simp only [*, mfld_simps] at h_my_y
      try simp only [*, mfld_simps])))
  | _ => throwError "goal should be an equality or an inclusion"

attribute [mfld_simps] and_true eq_self_iff_true Function.comp_apply

end Tactic.MfldSetTac

open Function Set

variable {α : Type*} {β : Type*} {γ : Type*} {δ : Type*}

/-- Local equivalence between subsets `source` and `target` of `α` and `β` respectively. The
(global) maps `toFun : α → β` and `invFun : β → α` map `source` to `target` and conversely, and are
inverse to each other there. The values of `toFun` outside of `source` and of `invFun` outside of
`target` are irrelevant. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/PartialEquiv/Variant01fa208ca843f8cada4ed3461c4f67f802931c470c359b124b2cc021aee96f89.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/PartialEquiv/Variant01fa208ca843f8cada4ed3461c4f67f802931c470c359b124b2cc021aee96f89.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e99803f897768479fd5c06f5783f664d775ec87d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
