## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f1fb91fd-3956-93da-aa9c-a3b176f730f0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 212–230.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem observational_defect_compose
    {Input : Type u} {Observation : Type v}
    [PseudoMetricSpace Observation]
    {direct middle summarized : Input → Observation}
    {firstBudget secondBudget : Input → ℝ}
    (first : ObservationalDefectWithin direct middle firstBudget)
    (second : ObservationalDefectWithin middle summarized secondBudget) :
    ObservationalDefectWithin direct summarized
      (fun input => firstBudget input + secondBudget input) := by
  intro input
  calc
    dist (direct input) (summarized input) ≤
        dist (direct input) (middle input) +
          dist (middle input) (summarized input) :=
      dist_triangle _ _ _
    _ ≤ firstBudget input + secondBudget input :=
      add_le_add (first input) (second input)

/-- A zero observational budget forces zero observational distance. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/InterpreterExactness/Variant449999532a37c55a38ea56301b6dddfc43c44e3f64fbd58d28d2f7ddf5f29e18.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/InterpreterExactness/Variant449999532a37c55a38ea56301b6dddfc43c44e3f64fbd58d28d2f7ddf5f29e18.lean#L212).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e311c7482c7450f00f4077bce7bb4bd182dc65ed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
