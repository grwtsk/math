## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8c3ca4ff-80cb-7c15-93ae-43eb45391bf4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 550–557.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isUnit_mk {a : M} : IsUnit (Associates.mk a) ↔ IsUnit a :=
  calc
    IsUnit (Associates.mk a) ↔ a ~ᵤ 1 := by
      rw [isUnit_iff_eq_one, one_eq_mk_one, mk_eq_mk_iff_associated]
    _ ↔ IsUnit a := associated_one_iff_isUnit

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Associated/Variant184b9c160159d0579048c083664a9bbe62335ccdaf292d1b8201e5f190736899.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Associated/Variant184b9c160159d0579048c083664a9bbe62335ccdaf292d1b8201e5f190736899.lean#L550).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e2949c48a2fe8cc0edbe4b98abcd771248425e03` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
