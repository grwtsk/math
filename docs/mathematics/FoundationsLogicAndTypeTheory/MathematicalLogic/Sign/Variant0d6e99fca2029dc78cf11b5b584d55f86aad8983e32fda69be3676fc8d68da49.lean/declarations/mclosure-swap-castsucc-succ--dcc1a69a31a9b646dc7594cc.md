## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:80c3d163-8b10-6434-2b39-0e61a65eaabe`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 133–154.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mclosure_swap_castSucc_succ (n : ℕ) :
    Submonoid.closure (Set.range fun i : Fin n ↦ swap i.castSucc i.succ) = ⊤ := by
  apply top_unique

  rintro _ ⟨i, j, ne, rfl⟩
  wlog lt : i < j generalizing i j
  · rw [swap_comm]; exact this _ _ ne.symm (ne.lt_or_gt.resolve_left lt)
  induction j using Fin.induction with
  | zero => cases lt
  | succ j ih =>
    have mem : swap j.castSucc j.succ ∈ Submonoid.closure
      (Set.range fun (i : Fin n) ↦ swap i.castSucc i.succ) := Submonoid.subset_closure ⟨_, rfl⟩
    obtain rfl | lts := (Fin.le_castSucc_iff.mpr lt).eq_or_lt
    · exact mem
    rw [swap_comm, ← swap_mul_swap_mul_swap (y := Fin.castSucc j) lts.ne lt.ne]
    exact mul_mem (mul_mem mem <| ih lts.ne lts) mem

/-- Like `swap_induction_on`, but with the composition on the right of `f`.

An induction principle for permutations. If `motive` holds for the identity permutation, and
is preserved under composition with a non-trivial swap, then `motive` holds for all permutations. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Sign/Variant0d6e99fca2029dc78cf11b5b584d55f86aad8983e32fda69be3676fc8d68da49.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Sign/Variant0d6e99fca2029dc78cf11b5b584d55f86aad8983e32fda69be3676fc8d68da49.lean#L133).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `78c5c6732f9c48a4db6c180e171215eea347839d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
