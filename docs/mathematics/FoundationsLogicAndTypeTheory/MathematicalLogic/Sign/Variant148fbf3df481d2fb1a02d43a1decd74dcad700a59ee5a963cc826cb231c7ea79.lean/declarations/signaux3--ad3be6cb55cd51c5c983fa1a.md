## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:67cd826e57ea1bb3c94722ddff80407e722c6c1e5a03ebfc77525923d8a4b308`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 329–334.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def signAux3 [Finite α] (f : Perm α) {s : Multiset α} : (∀ x, x ∈ s) → ℤˣ :=
  Quotient.hrecOn s (fun l _ => signAux2 l f) fun l₁ l₂ h ↦ by
    rcases Finite.exists_equiv_fin α with ⟨n, ⟨e⟩⟩
    refine Function.hfunext (forall_congr fun _ ↦ propext h.mem_iff) fun h₁ h₂ _ ↦ ?_
    rw [← signAux_eq_signAux2 _ _ e fun _ _ => h₁ _, ← signAux_eq_signAux2 _ _ e fun _ _ => h₂ _]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Sign/Variant148fbf3df481d2fb1a02d43a1decd74dcad700a59ee5a963cc826cb231c7ea79.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Sign/Variant148fbf3df481d2fb1a02d43a1decd74dcad700a59ee5a963cc826cb231c7ea79.lean#L329).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a4dc3c2703d805168a0b8fb8791b69f61096c532` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
