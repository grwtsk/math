## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:043d3bf8b9090f783950b7fb6fa1ac22728a99a7f80aa024d7f15c27b12eab11`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–54.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def modSwap [DecidableEq α] (i j : α) : Setoid (Perm α) :=
  ⟨fun σ τ => σ = τ ∨ σ = swap i j * τ, fun σ => Or.inl (refl σ), fun {σ τ} h =>
    Or.casesOn h (fun h => Or.inl h.symm) fun h => Or.inr (by rw [h, swap_mul_self_mul]),
    fun {σ τ υ} hστ hτυ => by
    cases' hστ with hστ hστ <;> cases' hτυ with hτυ hτυ <;> try rw [hστ, hτυ, swap_mul_self_mul] <;>
    simp [hστ, hτυ] -- porting note: should close goals, but doesn't
    · simp [hστ, hτυ]
    · simp [hστ, hτυ]
    · simp [hστ, hτυ]⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Sign/Variant644bbb5aff82b87de9bb040d24753408c3d9431b982beb28b1c7dd758bc63400.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Sign/Variant644bbb5aff82b87de9bb040d24753408c3d9431b982beb28b1c7dd758bc63400.lean#L44).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `05ae132b86102a2cde2ffbc4acd150637e8d8e20` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
