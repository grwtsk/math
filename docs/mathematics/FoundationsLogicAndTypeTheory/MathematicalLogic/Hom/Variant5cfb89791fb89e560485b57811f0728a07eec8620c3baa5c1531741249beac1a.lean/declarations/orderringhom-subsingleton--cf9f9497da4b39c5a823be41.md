## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e5ff6784f236714811efa94d8959016eb24ed5aed4a70a53854e2b9491ec0766`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 23–39.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance OrderRingHom.subsingleton [Field α] [LinearOrder α]
    [Field β] [LinearOrder β] [IsStrictOrderedRing β] [Archimedean β] :
    Subsingleton (α →+*o β) :=
  ⟨fun f g => by
    ext x
    by_contra! h' : f x ≠ g x
    wlog h : f x < g x with h₂
    · exact h₂ g f x (Ne.symm h') (h'.lt_or_lt.resolve_left h)
    obtain ⟨q, hf, hg⟩ := exists_rat_btwn h
    rw [← map_ratCast f] at hf
    rw [← map_ratCast g] at hg
    exact
      (lt_asymm ((OrderHomClass.mono g).reflect_lt hg) <|
          (OrderHomClass.mono f).reflect_lt hf).elim⟩

/-- There is at most one ordered ring isomorphism between a linear ordered field and an archimedean
linear ordered field. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Hom/Variant5cfb89791fb89e560485b57811f0728a07eec8620c3baa5c1531741249beac1a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Hom/Variant5cfb89791fb89e560485b57811f0728a07eec8620c3baa5c1531741249beac1a.lean#L23).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a506df64004a1c417d19ad0dcbd71f13950644f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
