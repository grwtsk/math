## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9e8b57dc-4684-43d3-0ed6-962e80d444a3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 141–158.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem computed_support_replay_target
    (providers : Provider → CertifiedProofRoute Artifact Revision Claim Target)
    (inventory withdrawnProviders : Finset Provider) (withdrawnClaims : Finset Claim)
    {current future : SourceSnapshot Artifact Revision}
    (agreement : SnapshotAgreesOn
      (eligibleReadUnion providers inventory withdrawnProviders withdrawnClaims current)
      current future) {claim : Claim}
    (supported : claim ∈ supportedClaims (fun provider ↦ (providers provider).route)
      (eligibleProviders providers inventory withdrawnProviders withdrawnClaims current)) :
    Target future claim :=
  grounded_replay_target providers inventory withdrawnProviders withdrawnClaims agreement
    ((mem_supportedClaims_iff _ _ claim).mp supported)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Locality/FiniteRuleTransport__SourceOccurrenced249bdfb5ebf2b5834b17c59.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Locality/FiniteRuleTransport.lean#L141).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e3b7396e50342f63b9b5df2b1cb162de4e305a5b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
