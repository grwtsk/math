## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:309743a6-8ea4-3c9d-6998-01c3b1897986`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 576–588.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem bind_dom {f : Part α} {g : α → Part β} : (f.bind g).Dom ↔ ∃ h : f.Dom, (g (f.get h)).Dom :=
  Iff.rfl

section Instances

/-!
We define several instances for constants and operations on `Part α` inherited from `α`.

This section could be moved to a separate file to avoid the import of
`Mathlib/Algebra/Notation/Defs.lean`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Part/Variant64888cbb8dd3d8933cb61918927d720a9e8122e409e3a5cbea4b54da2e2764df.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Part/Variant64888cbb8dd3d8933cb61918927d720a9e8122e409e3a5cbea4b54da2e2764df.lean#L576).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `26e0b8cc5fdaafe547d3146c13c8e5543d767ead` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
