## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5675263e-0835-7707-2662-cb61a3df1b95`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 625–643.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem bind_le {α} (x : Part α) (f : α → Part β) (y : Part β) :
    x >>= f ≤ y ↔ ∀ a, a ∈ x → f a ≤ y := by
  constructor <;> intro h
  · intro a h' b
    have h := h b
    simp only [and_imp, exists_prop, bind_eq_bind, mem_bind_iff, exists_imp] at h
    apply h _ h'
  · intro b h'
    simp only [exists_prop, bind_eq_bind, mem_bind_iff] at h'
    rcases h' with ⟨a, h₀, h₁⟩
    apply h _ h₀ _ h₁
#align part.bind_le Part.bind_le

/-- `restrict p o h` replaces the domain of `o` with `p`, and is well defined when
  `p` implies `o` is defined. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Part/Variantb2f9a4f661f7e909a0e7ba512c7f82bab61ecaacb726f600c4bbd66daf9037ea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Part/Variantb2f9a4f661f7e909a0e7ba512c7f82bab61ecaacb726f600c4bbd66daf9037ea.lean#L625).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7fbcc2d308a2c25aac965329c0bb94793db1b7da` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
