## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cce443ac-b90a-ce7d-cea9-cdb3b679c487`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 246–268.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ofComplex_conj (c : ℂ) : ofComplex (conj c) = involute (ofComplex c) :=
  CliffordAlgebraComplex.equiv.injective <| by
    rw [equiv_apply, equiv_apply, toComplex_involute, toComplex_ofComplex, toComplex_ofComplex]
#align clifford_algebra_complex.of_complex_conj CliffordAlgebraComplex.ofComplex_conj

-- this name is too short for us to want it visible after `open CliffordAlgebraComplex`
--attribute [protected] Q -- Porting note: removed

end CliffordAlgebraComplex

/-! ### The clifford algebra isomorphic to the quaternions -/


namespace CliffordAlgebraQuaternion

open scoped Quaternion

open QuaternionAlgebra

variable {R : Type*} [CommRing R] (c₁ c₂ : R)

/-- `Q c₁ c₂` is a quadratic form over `R × R` such that `CliffordAlgebra (Q c₁ c₂)` is isomorphic
as an `R`-algebra to `ℍ[R,c₁,c₂]`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Equivs/Variantcff3de8c202ed6517014cdbafd66b81511fc8bb87374d1b5178ac45a2a84fa51.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Equivs/Variantcff3de8c202ed6517014cdbafd66b81511fc8bb87374d1b5178ac45a2a84fa51.lean#L246).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a65ea0d047b84f7c1ea409024bfbf24fdda4c019` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
