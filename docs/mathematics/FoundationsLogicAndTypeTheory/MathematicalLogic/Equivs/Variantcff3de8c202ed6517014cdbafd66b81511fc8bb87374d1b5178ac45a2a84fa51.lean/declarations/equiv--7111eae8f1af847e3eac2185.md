## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9f7318d66ee96506713b29f4ef7a992514e73d29acfbbf29f7c15fa8cd819012`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 119–136.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def equiv : CliffordAlgebra (0 : QuadraticForm R Unit) ≃ₐ[R] R :=
  AlgEquiv.ofAlgHom
    (CliffordAlgebra.lift (0 : QuadraticForm R Unit) <|
      ⟨0, fun m : Unit => (zero_mul (0 : R)).trans (algebraMap R _).map_zero.symm⟩)
    (Algebra.ofId R _) (by ext x; exact AlgHom.commutes _ x)
    (by ext : 1; rw [ι_eq_zero, LinearMap.comp_zero, LinearMap.comp_zero])
#align clifford_algebra_ring.equiv CliffordAlgebraRing.equiv

end CliffordAlgebraRing

/-! ### The clifford algebra isomorphic to the complex numbers -/


namespace CliffordAlgebraComplex

open scoped ComplexConjugate

/-- The quadratic form sending elements to the negation of their square. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Equivs/Variantcff3de8c202ed6517014cdbafd66b81511fc8bb87374d1b5178ac45a2a84fa51.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Equivs/Variantcff3de8c202ed6517014cdbafd66b81511fc8bb87374d1b5178ac45a2a84fa51.lean#L119).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a65ea0d047b84f7c1ea409024bfbf24fdda4c019` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
