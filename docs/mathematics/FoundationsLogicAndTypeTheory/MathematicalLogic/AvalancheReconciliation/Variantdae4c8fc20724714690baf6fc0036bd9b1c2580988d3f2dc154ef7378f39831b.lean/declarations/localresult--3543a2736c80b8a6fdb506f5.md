## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e5e73d0c470c864c95fc1ec7b1499e7a898dac921ad191e5580ab0f19517602e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 349–359.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def localResult
    {partition : GlobalAvalanchePartition tree}
    (system : PartitionGlobalLocalRelaxationSystem partition)
    (node : tree.Node)
    (initial : G.Coord → ℝ) :
    (tree.region node).LocalCoord → ℝ :=
  system.localReference node +
    system.localOperator node
      (restrictSignal (tree.region node) initial - system.localReference node)

/-- GLT-01 simultaneously specializes to every selected partition region. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/AvalancheReconciliation/Variantdae4c8fc20724714690baf6fc0036bd9b1c2580988d3f2dc154ef7378f39831b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/AvalancheReconciliation/Variantdae4c8fc20724714690baf6fc0036bd9b1c2580988d3f2dc154ef7378f39831b.lean#L349).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9e85d1315ff6f942b61c41018bbe6c2a6694f3e3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
