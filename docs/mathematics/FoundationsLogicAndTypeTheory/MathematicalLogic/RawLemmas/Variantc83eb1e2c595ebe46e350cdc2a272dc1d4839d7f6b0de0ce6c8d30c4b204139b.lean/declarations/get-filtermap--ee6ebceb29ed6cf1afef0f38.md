## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7c4cf07a-a925-2bc2-224a-37f1c8c80af9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 4672–4679.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem get_filterMap [EquivBEq α] [LawfulHashable α]
    {f : α → β → Option γ} {k : α} (h : m.1.WF) {h'} :
    Const.get (m.filterMap f) k h' =
      (f (m.getKey k (contains_of_contains_filterMap m h h'))
        (Const.get m k (contains_of_contains_filterMap m h h'))).get
          (isSome_apply_of_contains_filterMap m h h') := by
  simp_to_model [filterMap, getKey, Const.get] using List.getValue_filterMap

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/RawLemmas/Variantc83eb1e2c595ebe46e350cdc2a272dc1d4839d7f6b0de0ce6c8d30c4b204139b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/RawLemmas/Variantc83eb1e2c595ebe46e350cdc2a272dc1d4839d7f6b0de0ce6c8d30c4b204139b.lean#L4672).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `88edaba28e5ebf2aa594debeac940d2e56bf11ae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
