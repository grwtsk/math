## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2a2f13c1-8c94-a2f9-f07a-133a6676f7f8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 264–274.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem certified_supported_to_terminal {Target : SourceSnapshot Artifact Revision → Claim → Prop}
    (providers : Provider → CertifiedProofRoute Artifact Revision Claim Target)
    (inventory withdrawnProviders : Finset Provider) (withdrawnClaims : Finset Claim)
    (current : SourceSnapshot Artifact Revision) (claim : Claim)
    (supported : claim ∈ supportedClaims (fun provider ↦ (providers provider).route)
      (eligibleProviders providers inventory withdrawnProviders withdrawnClaims current)) :
    TerminalCap current (Target current claim) :=
  ⟨certified_supported_target providers inventory withdrawnProviders withdrawnClaims
    current claim supported⟩

/-- Whole-claim withdrawal excludes every alternative provider for that claim. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Inference/FiniteRuleSystems__SourceOccurrenceae44fb0262f430d52afbbdcd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Logic/Inference/FiniteRuleSystems.lean#L264).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a257229bd43026937b34cc93486075286e2ab0fe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
