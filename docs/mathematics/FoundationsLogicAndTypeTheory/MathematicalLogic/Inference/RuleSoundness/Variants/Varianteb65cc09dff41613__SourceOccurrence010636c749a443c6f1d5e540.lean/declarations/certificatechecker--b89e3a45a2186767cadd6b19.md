## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a0fd1780d6d86c4e54b759b9f41ff670a0b83d9f9b415e47ad35ca27c2fe4ea4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 78–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure CertificateChecker (Snapshot : Type u) (Certificate : Type v)
    (Judgment : Type w) (Meaning : Snapshot → Judgment → Prop) where
  check : Snapshot → Certificate → DecisionResult
  conclusion : Certificate → Judgment
  accept_sound : ∀ snapshot certificate,
    check snapshot certificate = .accept →
      Meaning snapshot (conclusion certificate)

/-- A certificate is informative for an exact judgment only when the checker
accepts it and its declared conclusion is that judgment. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Inference/RuleSoundness/Variants/Varianteb65cc09dff41613__SourceOccurrence010636c749a443c6f1d5e540.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Inference/RuleSoundness.lean#L78).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4153791eb7a4143cd72ed997202c8bea64266d2e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
