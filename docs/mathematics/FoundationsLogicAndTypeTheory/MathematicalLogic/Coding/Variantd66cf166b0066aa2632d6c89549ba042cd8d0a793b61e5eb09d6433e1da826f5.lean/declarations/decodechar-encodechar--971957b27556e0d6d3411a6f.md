## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:474202cc-d4d9-8cf9-0c32-1bf4e540bc03`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 116–125.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] theorem decodeChar_encodeChar (x) : decodeChar (encodeChar x) = x := by
  ext; simp only [decodeChar, encodeChar]
  split
  · simp only [Char.ofNatAux, Char.toNat]; rfl
  · have : ¬ x.toNat - (Char.maxSurrogate + 1 - Char.minSurrogate) < Char.minSurrogate := by
      cases x; grind [Char.toNat]
    have : Char.maxSurrogate + 1 - Char.minSurrogate ≤ x.toNat := by grind
    simp [Char.ofNatAux, *]; rfl

/-- Encode `Option (Fin n)` into `Fin (n+1)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Coding/Variantd66cf166b0066aa2632d6c89549ba042cd8d0a793b61e5eb09d6433e1da826f5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Coding/Variantd66cf166b0066aa2632d6c89549ba042cd8d0a793b61e5eb09d6433e1da826f5.lean#L116).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5d20ed0d417ba2531877641fe383a99c6c49b73b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
