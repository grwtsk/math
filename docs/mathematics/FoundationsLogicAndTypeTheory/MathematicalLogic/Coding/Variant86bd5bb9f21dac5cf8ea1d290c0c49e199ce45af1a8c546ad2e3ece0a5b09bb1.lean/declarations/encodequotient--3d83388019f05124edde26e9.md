## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f312acb73855488b323c0a7dc8f08ea8d8deefbbef3d52f8beaebd44b67091f2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 506–513.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def encodeQuotient (s : Setoid (Fin n)) [DecidableRel s.r] (x : Quotient s) :
    Fin (Fin.countP fun i => getRepr s i = i) :=
  encodeSubtype _ <| Quotient.liftOn x (fun i => ⟨getRepr s i, getRepr_getRepr s i⟩) <| by
    intro _ _ h
    simp only [Subtype.mk.injEq]
    exact getRepr_eq_getRepr_of_equiv s h

/-- Decode `Quotient s` from `Fin m` where `s` is a decidable setoid on `Fin n`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Coding/Variant86bd5bb9f21dac5cf8ea1d290c0c49e199ce45af1a8c546ad2e3ece0a5b09bb1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Coding/Variant86bd5bb9f21dac5cf8ea1d290c0c49e199ce45af1a8c546ad2e3ece0a5b09bb1.lean#L506).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `34842f544b53c9ed6b375df6fce249942bd7ac12` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
