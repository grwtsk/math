## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:11fbe4ae060f31cc5968c39f9ad980895081a5b71fb9153e928a4ac0aa646b46`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 572–600.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance : AddCommGroup W.Point where
  nsmul := nsmulRec
  zsmul := zsmulRec
  zero_add _ := by
    classical
    apply (toAffineAddEquiv W).injective
    simp only [map_add, toAffineAddEquiv_apply, toAffineLift_zero, zero_add]
  add_zero _ := by
    classical
    apply (toAffineAddEquiv W).injective
    simp only [map_add, toAffineAddEquiv_apply, toAffineLift_zero, add_zero]
  neg_add_cancel P := by
    classical
    apply (toAffineAddEquiv W).injective
    simp only [map_add, toAffineAddEquiv_apply, toAffineLift_neg, neg_add_cancel, toAffineLift_zero]
  add_comm _ _ := by
    classical
    apply (toAffineAddEquiv W).injective
    simp only [map_add, add_comm]
  add_assoc _ _ _ := by
    classical
    apply (toAffineAddEquiv W).injective
    simp only [map_add, add_assoc]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Point/Varianta19936e26296edfde6ef0ce781c000941f6273299dd99a62292cc5df09c0294c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Point/Varianta19936e26296edfde6ef0ce781c000941f6273299dd99a62292cc5df09c0294c.lean#L572).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bdff5e56c91360a54f35df53b8ad8c01b9fcd4a1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
