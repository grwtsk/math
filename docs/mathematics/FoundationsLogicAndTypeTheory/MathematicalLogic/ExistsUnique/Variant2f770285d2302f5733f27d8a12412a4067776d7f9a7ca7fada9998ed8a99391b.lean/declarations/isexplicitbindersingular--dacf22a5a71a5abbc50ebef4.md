## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fbf7b42f53cb3634e7c513acafb47b568e9d3ca25e0489d2ea3b044693d9f9d0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 28–42.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
meta def isExplicitBinderSingular (xs : TSyntax ``explicitBinders) : Bool :=
  match xs with
  | `(explicitBinders| $_:binderIdent $[: $_]?) => true
  | `(explicitBinders| ($_:binderIdent : $_)) => true
  | _ => false

open TSyntax.Compat in
/--
`∃! x : α, p x` means that there exists a unique `x` in `α` such that `p x`.
This is notation for `ExistsUnique (fun (x : α) ↦ p x)`.

This notation does not allow multiple binders like `∃! (x : α) (y : β), p x y`
as a shorthand for `∃! (x : α), ∃! (y : β), p x y` since it is liable to be misunderstood.
Often, the intended meaning is instead `∃! q : α × β, p q.1 q.2`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/ExistsUnique/Variant2f770285d2302f5733f27d8a12412a4067776d7f9a7ca7fada9998ed8a99391b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/ExistsUnique/Variant2f770285d2302f5733f27d8a12412a4067776d7f9a7ca7fada9998ed8a99391b.lean#L28).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `75053fb087909647a7f2dc1d7078e9bd574b9bff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
