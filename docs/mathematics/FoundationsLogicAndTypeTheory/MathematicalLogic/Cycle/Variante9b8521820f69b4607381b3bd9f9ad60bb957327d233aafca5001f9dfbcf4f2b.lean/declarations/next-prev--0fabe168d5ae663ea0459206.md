## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:50d0d7a7-452f-c581-4745-c0e39fd68358`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 885–896.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
nonrec theorem next_prev (s : Cycle α) : ∀ (hs : Nodup s) (x : α) (hx : x ∈ s),
    s.next hs (s.prev hs x hx) (prev_mem s hs x hx) = x :=
  Quotient.inductionOn' s next_prev
#align cycle.next_prev Cycle.next_prev

end Decidable

/-- We define a representation of concrete cycles, available when viewing them in a goal state or
via `#eval`, when over representable types. For example, the cycle `(2 1 4 3)` will be shown
as `c[2, 1, 4, 3]`. Two equal cycles may be printed differently if their internal representation
is different.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Cycle/Variante9b8521820f69b4607381b3bd9f9ad60bb957327d233aafca5001f9dfbcf4f2b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Cycle/Variante9b8521820f69b4607381b3bd9f9ad60bb957327d233aafca5001f9dfbcf4f2b.lean#L885).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `968f548761284dc1e32e3166d8b3a4ffe6fcea69` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
