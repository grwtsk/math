## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a4ffe659-e4bb-7c63-3953-a38174449bb0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 858–863.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
nonrec theorem prev_reverse_eq_next' (s : Cycle α) (hs : Nodup s.reverse) (x : α)
    (hx : x ∈ s.reverse) :
    s.reverse.prev hs x hx = s.next (nodup_reverse_iff.mp hs) x (mem_reverse_iff.mp hx) :=
  prev_reverse_eq_next s (nodup_reverse_iff.mp hs) x (mem_reverse_iff.mp hx)

--Porting note: removed `simp` and added `next_reverse_eq_prev'` with `simp` attribute
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Cycle/Variant43d7a7e0642f56f414ae36624cd069401d19077c1f292d398460d4e369fd6cc3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Cycle/Variant43d7a7e0642f56f414ae36624cd069401d19077c1f292d398460d4e369fd6cc3.lean#L858).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ff1407b42ba1c0ae1bbe9ee2c4c076236142c712` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
