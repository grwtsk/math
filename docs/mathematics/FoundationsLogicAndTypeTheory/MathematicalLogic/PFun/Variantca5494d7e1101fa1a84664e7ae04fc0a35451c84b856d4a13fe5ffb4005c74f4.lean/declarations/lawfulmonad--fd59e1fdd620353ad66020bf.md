## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f983a1e0c996240f0c9bcc8bd85006bbbd7debc1a7d366af580774832d2c1e12`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 228–234.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance lawfulMonad : LawfulMonad (PFun α) := LawfulMonad.mk'
  (bind_pure_comp := fun f x => funext fun a => Part.bind_some_eq_map _ _)
  (id_map := fun f => by funext a; dsimp [Functor.map, PFun.map]; cases f a; rfl)
  (pure_bind := fun x f => funext fun a => Part.bind_some _ (f x))
  (bind_assoc := fun f g k => funext fun a => (f a).bind_assoc (fun b => g b a) fun b => k b a)
#align pfun.is_lawful_monad PFun.lawfulMonad

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/PFun/Variantca5494d7e1101fa1a84664e7ae04fc0a35451c84b856d4a13fe5ffb4005c74f4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/PFun/Variantca5494d7e1101fa1a84664e7ae04fc0a35451c84b856d4a13fe5ffb4005c74f4.lean#L228).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4bd2825be72e64cf08fdbc48520df16c11ef7e7d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
