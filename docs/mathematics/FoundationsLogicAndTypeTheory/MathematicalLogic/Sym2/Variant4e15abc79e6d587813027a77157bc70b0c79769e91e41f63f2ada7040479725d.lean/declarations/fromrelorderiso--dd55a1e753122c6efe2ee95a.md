## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d12f499720f47e9c7c2fe4e41f7c7e480cef6db0ffd5832c923209366c02f3c1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 742–750.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def fromRelOrderIso : { r : α → α → Prop // Std.Symm r } ≃o Set (Sym2 α) where
  toFun r := fromRel r.prop
  invFun s := ⟨ToRel s, toRel_symm s⟩
  left_inv r := by simp [toRel_fromRel]
  right_inv s := by simp [fromRel_toRel]
  map_rel_iff' {r₁ r₂} := by simpa using! fromRel_mono_iff ..

/-- `fromRel` induces an order embedding from symmetric relations to `Sym2` sets. -/
@[deprecated fromRelOrderIso (since := "2026-03-11")]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Sym2/Variant4e15abc79e6d587813027a77157bc70b0c79769e91e41f63f2ada7040479725d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Sym2/Variant4e15abc79e6d587813027a77157bc70b0c79769e91e41f63f2ada7040479725d.lean#L742).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bc45b0ddd54bb415b2b927ec44300938cdbab63b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
