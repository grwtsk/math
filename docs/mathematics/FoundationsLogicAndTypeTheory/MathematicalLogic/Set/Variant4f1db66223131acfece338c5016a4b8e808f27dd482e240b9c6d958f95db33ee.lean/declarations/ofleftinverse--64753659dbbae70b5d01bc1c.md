## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c5dead7a1575a88dc5ed2a46cb91dd56b25de6544dc49d85116a291aa70f466c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 583–598.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofLeftInverse {α β : Sort _} (f : α → β) (f_inv : Nonempty α → β → α)
    (hf : ∀ h : Nonempty α, LeftInverse (f_inv h) f) :
    α ≃ range f where
  toFun a := ⟨f a, a, rfl⟩
  invFun b := f_inv (nonempty_of_exists b.2) b
  left_inv a := hf ⟨a⟩ a
  right_inv := fun ⟨b, a, ha⟩ =>
    Subtype.eq <| show f (f_inv ⟨a⟩ b) = b from Eq.trans (congr_arg f <| ha ▸ hf _ a) ha
#align equiv.of_left_inverse Equiv.ofLeftInverse
#align equiv.of_left_inverse_apply_coe Equiv.ofLeftInverse_apply_coe
#align equiv.of_left_inverse_symm_apply Equiv.ofLeftInverse_symm_apply

/-- If `f : α → β` has a left-inverse, then `α` is computably equivalent to the range of `f`.

Note that if `α` is empty, no such `f_inv` exists and so this definition can't be used, unlike
the stronger but less convenient `ofLeftInverse`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Set/Variant4f1db66223131acfece338c5016a4b8e808f27dd482e240b9c6d958f95db33ee.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Set/Variant4f1db66223131acfece338c5016a4b8e808f27dd482e240b9c6d958f95db33ee.lean#L583).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `527038b2b336bf97df8e461ee4220c1cd8d9ca14` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
