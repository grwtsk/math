## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7892c1706058d3f618c6345629a7ebce0c95ee4709b44e6686f3669df48a7cc9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 194–210.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def image {α β : Type*} (e : α ≃ β) (s : Set α) :
    s ≃ e '' s where
  toFun x := ⟨e x.1, by simp⟩
  invFun y :=
    ⟨e.symm y.1, by
      rcases y with ⟨-, ⟨a, ⟨m, rfl⟩⟩⟩
      simpa using m⟩
  left_inv x := by simp
  right_inv y := by simp
#align equiv.image Equiv.image
#align equiv.image_symm_apply_coe Equiv.image_symm_apply_coe
#align equiv.image_apply_coe Equiv.image_apply_coe

--Porting note: Removed attribute @[simps apply symm_apply]
/-- `univ α` is equivalent to `α`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Set/Variant302c5773f0ce3690a7be51b6423cb29222c2a3f07aa0425e82aae6b74599272c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Set/Variant302c5773f0ce3690a7be51b6423cb29222c2a3f07aa0425e82aae6b74599272c.lean#L194).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `854d136bde8223995aa6c586afb59cbcfb53c628` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
