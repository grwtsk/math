## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:df8170abce4234fbdc6fc28a7a021e55440f551a4753b77ac83ca2b6c94d422a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 885–901.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instField : Field R⟦Γ⟧ where
  inv_zero := by simp [inv_def]
  mul_inv_cancel x x0 := by
    have h :=
      SummableFamily.one_sub_self_mul_hsum_powers
        (unit_aux x (inv_mul_cancel₀ (leadingCoeff_ne_zero.mpr x0)) _ (neg_add_cancel x.order))
    rw [sub_sub_cancel] at h
    rw [inv_def, ← mul_assoc, mul_comm x, h]
  nnqsmul := (· • ·)
  qsmul := (· • ·)
  nnqsmul_def q x := by ext; simp [← single_zero_nnratCast, NNRat.smul_def]
  qsmul_def q x := by ext; simp [← single_zero_ratCast, Rat.smul_def]
  nnratCast_def q := by
    simp [← single_zero_nnratCast, ← single_zero_natCast, NNRat.cast_def]
  ratCast_def q := by
    simp [← single_zero_ratCast, ← single_zero_intCast, ← single_zero_natCast, Rat.cast_def]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Summable/Variant081ab86ca9ad08160dcc7ca48030ce8f32d01bf60c046ba293ca68649c62807d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Summable/Variant081ab86ca9ad08160dcc7ca48030ce8f32d01bf60c046ba293ca68649c62807d.lean#L885).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `682ee3b5347fbcc173c8471955ed7031006956e2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
