## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bb4d4261-9f11-4680-1823-c00a0911d032`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 659–669.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dom_fintype [Finite α] (f : α → σ) : Primrec f :=
  let ⟨l, _, m⟩ := Finite.exists_univ_list α
  option_some_iff.1 <| by
    haveI := decidableEqOfEncodable α
    refine ((list_getElem?₁ (l.map f)).comp (list_idxOf₁ l)).of_eq fun a => ?_
    rw [List.getElem?_map, List.getElem?_idxOf (m a), Option.map_some]

-- Porting note: These are new lemmas
-- I added it because it actually simplified the proofs
-- and because I couldn't understand the original proof
/-- A function is `PrimrecBounded` if its size is bounded by a primitive recursive function -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Primrec/Variant0abfdccdc49d8d69ba6fd7792ebd5da17fa7a11fad7a19067ab990ed786c96d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Primrec/Variant0abfdccdc49d8d69ba6fd7792ebd5da17fa7a11fad7a19067ab990ed786c96d7.lean#L659).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aa29e01f0d1a686ffad25e687375d46bcadcfeb7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
