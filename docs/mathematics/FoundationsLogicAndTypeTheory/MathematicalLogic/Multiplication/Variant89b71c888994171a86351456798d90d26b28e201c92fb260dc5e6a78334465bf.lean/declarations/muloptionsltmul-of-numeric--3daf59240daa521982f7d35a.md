## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1fa05453-222f-fca8-7f7d-72d29236c221`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 370–392.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- A condition just enough to deduce P3, which will always be used with `x'` being a left
  option of `x₂`. When `y₁` is a left option of `y₂`, it can be deduced from induction hypotheses
  `IH24 x₁ x₂ y₂`, `IH4 x₁ x₂ y₂`, and `(x₂ * y₂).Numeric` (`ih3_of_ih`); when `y₁` is
  not necessarily an option of `y₂`, it follows from the induction hypothesis for P3 (with `x₂`
  replaced by a left option `x'`) after the `main` theorem (P124) is established, and is used to
  prove P3 in full (`P3_of_lt_of_lt`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Multiplication/Variant89b71c888994171a86351456798d90d26b28e201c92fb260dc5e6a78334465bf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Multiplication/Variant89b71c888994171a86351456798d90d26b28e201c92fb260dc5e6a78334465bf.lean#L370).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `34dec25f964853a34aa6a75b2e028953923aded2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
