## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:29240a54-a041-e277-b0cb-15f3acc3ad0e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 324–330.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma numeric_of_ih (ih' : ∀ a, ArgsRel a (Args.P24 x₁ x₂ y) → P124 a) :
    (x₁ * y).Numeric ∧ (x₂ * y).Numeric := by
  constructor <;> refine ih' (Args.P1 _ _) (TransGen.single ?_)
  · exact (cutExpand_add_right {y}).2 <| (cutExpand_add_left {x₁}).2 cutExpand_zero
  · exact (cutExpand_add_right {x₂, y}).2 cutExpand_zero

/-- Symmetry properties of `IH24`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Multiplication/Variant8d97badbc3ae0cf360a334a9b6ca8449e6f00b936284edf226777dbad172ba33.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Multiplication/Variant8d97badbc3ae0cf360a334a9b6ca8449e6f00b936284edf226777dbad172ba33.lean#L324).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7f3427722cfbb35fc0546f9e12da3ac18023e775` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
