## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:702c8e7e01da66c9c41cefbe2522aedc2282d7d0cf851c41113d2f3c40bbf551`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 32–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def validPacketGradeEquiv
    (C : FilesystemMatrixCodec Snapshot r) :
    C.ValidPacketType ≃ Σ k, C.ValidPacketFiber k where
  toFun p := ⟨p.1.rows, ⟨p, rfl⟩⟩
  invFun graded := graded.2.1
  left_inv p := rfl
  right_inv graded := by
    rcases graded with ⟨k, p, hp⟩
    subst k
    rfl

/-- The lossless snapshot code with the packet row count exposed as a grade. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Grading/Variant9ef65a875ca4d71c47c5c801addc3c278be30d0d692a3e63e9dbc1d98a9ab181.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Grading/Variant9ef65a875ca4d71c47c5c801addc3c278be30d0d692a3e63e9dbc1d98a9ab181.lean#L32).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dc7656dfc0c4cb83393e27599732498e797f0365` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
