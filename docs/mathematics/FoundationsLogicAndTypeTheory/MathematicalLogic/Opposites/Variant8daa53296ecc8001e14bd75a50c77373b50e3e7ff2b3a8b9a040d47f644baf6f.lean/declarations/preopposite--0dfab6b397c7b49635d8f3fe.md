## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:51e5e5cf1e8ef2cbf86471ca19e3f29bb369f252b1298d83c56722ac9694106e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 59–67.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure PreOpposite (α : Type u) : Type u where
  /-- The element of `PreOpposite α` that represents `x : α`. -/ op' ::
  /-- The element of `α` represented by `x : PreOpposite α`. -/ unop' : α

/-- Multiplicative opposite of a type. This type inherits all additive structures on `α` and
reverses left and right in multiplication.-/
@[to_additive
      "Additive opposite of a type. This type inherits all multiplicative structures on `α` and
      reverses left and right in addition."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Opposites/Variant8daa53296ecc8001e14bd75a50c77373b50e3e7ff2b3a8b9a040d47f644baf6f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Opposites/Variant8daa53296ecc8001e14bd75a50c77373b50e3e7ff2b3a8b9a040d47f644baf6f.lean#L59).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a8c8aba9a6b0a78b8a952b44450519e923cd849` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
