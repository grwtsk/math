## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8171078e-655e-da5b-770f-b595ecaa81f7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 539–543.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_image_iff (f : α → β) (x : Set α) (P : β → Prop) :
    (∃ a : f '' x, P a) ↔ ∃ a : x, P (f a) :=
  ⟨fun ⟨a, h⟩ => ⟨⟨_, a.prop.choose_spec.1⟩, a.prop.choose_spec.2.symm ▸ h⟩, fun ⟨a, h⟩ =>
    ⟨⟨_, _, a.prop, rfl⟩, h⟩⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Image/Variant18c986ebc5a3a711df4f93a4ad7b749f285849e83c048544db3c0d01dafbaa47.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Image/Variant18c986ebc5a3a711df4f93a4ad7b749f285849e83c048544db3c0d01dafbaa47.lean#L539).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `30af0b82b2fed14cb95764375d0b943cd8ff4725` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
