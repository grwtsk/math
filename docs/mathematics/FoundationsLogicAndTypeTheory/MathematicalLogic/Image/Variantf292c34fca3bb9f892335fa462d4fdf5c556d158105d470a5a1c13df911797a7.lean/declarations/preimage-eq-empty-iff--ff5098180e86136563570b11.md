## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0be1f1cf-3fc0-6b2f-ed94-e83ef5f7abf9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1372–1388.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem preimage_eq_empty_iff {s : Set β} : f ⁻¹' s = ∅ ↔ Disjoint s (range f) :=
  ⟨fun h => by
    simp only [eq_empty_iff_forall_notMem, disjoint_iff_inter_eq_empty, not_exists, mem_inter_iff,
      not_and, mem_range, mem_preimage] at h ⊢
    intro y hy x hx
    rw [← hx] at hy
    exact h x hy,
  preimage_eq_empty⟩

end Set

end Disjoint

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Image/Variantf292c34fca3bb9f892335fa462d4fdf5c556d158105d470a5a1c13df911797a7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Image/Variantf292c34fca3bb9f892335fa462d4fdf5c556d158105d470a5a1c13df911797a7.lean#L1372).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a055e8fb749e19d52975af484fcb5a4dfb24fd4c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
