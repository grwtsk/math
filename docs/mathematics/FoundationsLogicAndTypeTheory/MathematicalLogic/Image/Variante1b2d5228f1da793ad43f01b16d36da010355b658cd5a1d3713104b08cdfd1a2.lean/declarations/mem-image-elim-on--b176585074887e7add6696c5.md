## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0e37e8a9-d32f-8dfc-2a15-99b23aa50336`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 258–264.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_image_elim_on {f : α → β} {s : Set α} {C : β → Prop} {y : β} (h_y : y ∈ f '' s)
    (h : ∀ x : α, x ∈ s → C (f x)) : C y :=
  mem_image_elim h h_y
#align set.mem_image_elim_on Set.mem_image_elim_on

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Image/Variante1b2d5228f1da793ad43f01b16d36da010355b658cd5a1d3713104b08cdfd1a2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Image/Variante1b2d5228f1da793ad43f01b16d36da010355b658cd5a1d3713104b08cdfd1a2.lean#L258).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `de9820c0fa706d6e02f220d23df3b2d5da9a66e4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
