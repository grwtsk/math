## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b772f6b98dfca2966b303b954f8eccf6764ab1d04a13078565aa78e5246f8413`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 47–56.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def HNNExtension.con (G : Type*) [Group G] (A B : Subgroup G) (φ : A ≃* B) :
    Con (G ∗ Multiplicative ℤ) :=
  conGen (fun x y => ∃ (a : A),
    x = inr (ofAdd 1) * inl (a : G) ∧
    y = inl (φ a : G) * inr (ofAdd 1))

/-- The HNN Extension of a group `G`, `HNNExtension G A B φ`. Given a group `G`, subgroups `A` and
`B` and an isomorphism `φ` of `A` and `B`, we adjoin a letter `t` to `G`, such that for
any `a ∈ A`, the conjugate of `of a` by `t` is `of (φ a)`, where `of` is the canonical
map from `G` into the `HNNExtension`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/HNNExtension/Variant793a3dd6f9f47e272d6f5b8fae5ddb90272307cc7948260ffb675755bb886156.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/HNNExtension/Variant793a3dd6f9f47e272d6f5b8fae5ddb90272307cc7948260ffb675755bb886156.lean#L47).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2d27507a32a8fdf470f3ab7ed7f4a9c7e7c3f898` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
