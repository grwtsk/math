## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:747552e9d3de9792326f58c67c779d8e78adf349966b7101ad248d7e84efca42`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 185–191.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance TransversalPair.nonempty : Nonempty (TransversalPair G A B) := by
  choose t ht using fun u ↦ (toSubgroup A B u).exists_isComplement_right 1
  exact ⟨⟨t, fun i ↦ (ht i).1⟩⟩

/-- A reduced word is a `head`, which is an element of `G`, followed by the product list of pairs.
There should also be no sequences of the form `t^u * g * t^-u`, where `g` is in
`toSubgroup A B u` This is a less strict condition than required for `NormalWord`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/HNNExtension/Varianteea71b84d18b560d22c7907730a1e4c1160904760e650be1d5624d7d02344d3b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/HNNExtension/Varianteea71b84d18b560d22c7907730a1e4c1160904760e650be1d5624d7d02344d3b.lean#L185).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `caf84a812ad79352b5951af0d067db389bb80433` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
