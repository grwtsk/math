## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d3ba090f56317106fdebccfb7537f8e24d635d595ec64d66d058ff8311328e75`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 276–293.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def cons (g : G) (u : ℤˣ) (w : NormalWord d) (h1 : w.head ∈ d.set u)
    (h2 : ∀ u' ∈ Option.map Prod.fst w.toList.head?, w.head ∈ toSubgroup A B u → u = u') :
    NormalWord d :=
  { head := g,
    toList := (u, w.head) :: w.toList,
    mem_set := by
      intro u' g' h'
      simp only [List.mem_cons, Prod.mk.injEq] at h'
      rcases h' with ⟨rfl, rfl⟩ | h'
      · exact h1
      · exact w.mem_set _ _ h'
    chain := by
      refine List.isChain_cons.2 ⟨?_, w.chain⟩
      rintro ⟨u', g'⟩ hu' hw1
      exact h2 _ (by simp_all) hw1 }

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/HNNExtension/Variantaa07ebaf262362ddf9c38cc250585af7a2c18b3f3f445b9098322097feb8c67a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/HNNExtension/Variantaa07ebaf262362ddf9c38cc250585af7a2c18b3f3f445b9098322097feb8c67a.lean#L276).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a01288bc39d0afd4d2b3230c62eff275de3ce01` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
