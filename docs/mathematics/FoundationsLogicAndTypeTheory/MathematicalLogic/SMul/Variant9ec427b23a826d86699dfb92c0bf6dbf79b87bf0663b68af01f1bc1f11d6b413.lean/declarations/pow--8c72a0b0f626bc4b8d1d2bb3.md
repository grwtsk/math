## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b98cb6a6-d6e3-1a20-f077-303331783560`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 160–167.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pow (n : ℕ) (ra : IsSMulRegular M a) : IsSMulRegular M (a ^ n) := by
  induction' n with n hn
  · rw [pow_zero]; simp only [one]
  · rw [pow_succ]
    exact (ra.smul_iff (a ^ n)).mpr hn
#align is_smul_regular.pow IsSMulRegular.pow

/-- An element `a` is `M`-regular if and only if a positive power of `a` is `M`-regular. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/SMul/Variant9ec427b23a826d86699dfb92c0bf6dbf79b87bf0663b68af01f1bc1f11d6b413.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/SMul/Variant9ec427b23a826d86699dfb92c0bf6dbf79b87bf0663b68af01f1bc1f11d6b413.lean#L160).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f3b6559d24133f1471072e4a9e0446cbcdb9c337` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
