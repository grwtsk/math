## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9b7de66f56f58da2b95db04ce960036d0d4ba1b6c5e0884289c5f6670dae266e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 566–576.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [Zero α] [Zero β] [SMul α β] [NoZeroSMulDivisors α β] :
    NoZeroSMulDivisors (Set α) (Set β) :=
  ⟨fun {s t} h ↦ by
    by_contra' H
    have hst : (s • t).Nonempty := h.symm.subst zero_nonempty
    rw [Ne.def, ← hst.of_smul_left.subset_zero_iff, Ne.def,
      ← hst.of_smul_right.subset_zero_iff] at H
    simp only [not_subset, mem_zero] at H
    obtain ⟨⟨a, hs, ha⟩, b, ht, hb⟩ := H
    exact (eq_zero_or_eq_zero_of_smul_eq_zero <| h.subset <| smul_mem_smul hs ht).elim ha hb⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/SMul/Variantf6caaee322390f58301f958525c382d902beaab2205124d8ae364d33c5d98a81.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/SMul/Variantf6caaee322390f58301f958525c382d902beaab2205124d8ae364d33c5d98a81.lean#L566).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `599241feca37bc5bd1ca7b6cdb0c89c519f6c59f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
