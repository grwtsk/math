## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b2d5d1f6-61eb-27a8-1999-137d15344f53`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 446–456.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] theorem executeRawCoverage_rejects_zero_samples
    (invocation : RawCoverageInvocation) (cell : CellSupport)
    (validSupport : checkRawCellSupport invocation.request.support = .ok cell)
    (noExact : invocation.request.exactCoverage = none)
    (zero : invocation.request.samples = 0) :
    executeRawCoverage invocation = .error .invalidSampleCount :=
  coverageResult_rejects_zero_samples invocation.request cell validSupport
    noExact zero

/-- Complete foreign coverage invocation, retaining region shape, tagged
numeric support, JavaScript sample-count shape, and callback outcomes. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Correspondence/Variant97e26f29130f5e1eceef50bb2888c8d9b71904b2d3939474084d49543e080d06.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Correspondence/Variant97e26f29130f5e1eceef50bb2888c8d9b71904b2d3939474084d49543e080d06.lean#L446).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e726e2511a9c193210be8ebc59372d3615c907e4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
