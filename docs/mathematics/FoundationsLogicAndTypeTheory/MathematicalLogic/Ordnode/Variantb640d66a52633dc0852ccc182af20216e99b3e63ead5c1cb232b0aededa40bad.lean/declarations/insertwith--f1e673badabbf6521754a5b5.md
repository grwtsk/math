## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4516280a5dc62eb04f1da5b94d911df61f59f696cfbb83c6806aa354ce466fac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 848–866.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def insertWith (f : α → α) (x : α) : Ordnode α → Ordnode α
  | nil => ι x
  | node sz l y r =>
    match cmpLE x y with
    | Ordering.lt => balanceL (insertWith f x l) y r
    | Ordering.eq => node sz l (f y) r
    | Ordering.gt => balanceR l y (insertWith f x r)

/-- O(log n). Modify an element in the set with the given function,
doing nothing if the key is not found.
Note that the element returned by `f` must be equivalent to `x`.

    adjustWith f 0 {1, 2, 3} = {1, 2, 3}
    adjustWith f 1 {1, 2, 3} = {f 1, 2, 3}

Using a preorder on `ℕ × ℕ` that only compares the first coordinate:

    adjustWith f (1, 1) {(0, 1), (1, 2)} = {(0, 1), f (1, 2)}
    adjustWith f (3, 1) {(0, 1), (1, 2)} = {(0, 1), (1, 2)} -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Ordnode/Variantb640d66a52633dc0852ccc182af20216e99b3e63ead5c1cb232b0aededa40bad.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Ordnode/Variantb640d66a52633dc0852ccc182af20216e99b3e63ead5c1cb232b0aededa40bad.lean#L848).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c6e3f915c87687bca4ee51bc70ce0d44f5f09270` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
