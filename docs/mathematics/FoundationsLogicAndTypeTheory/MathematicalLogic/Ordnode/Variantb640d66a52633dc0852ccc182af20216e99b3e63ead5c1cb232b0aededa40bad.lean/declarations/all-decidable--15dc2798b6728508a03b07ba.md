## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4d386c90032e2e81cccce259e11076a48177a18ca605b81093499de7889efb30`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 307–317.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance All.decidable {P : α → Prop} : (t : Ordnode α) → [DecidablePred P] → Decidable (All P t)
  | nil => isTrue trivial
  | node _ l m r =>
    have : Decidable (All P l) := All.decidable l
    have : Decidable (All P r) := All.decidable r
    inferInstanceAs <| Decidable (All P l ∧ P m ∧ All P r)

/-- O(n). Does any element of the map satisfy property `P`?

     Any (fun x ↦ x < 2) {1, 2, 3} = True
     Any (fun x ↦ x < 2) {2, 3, 5} = False -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Ordnode/Variantb640d66a52633dc0852ccc182af20216e99b3e63ead5c1cb232b0aededa40bad.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Ordnode/Variantb640d66a52633dc0852ccc182af20216e99b3e63ead5c1cb232b0aededa40bad.lean#L307).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c6e3f915c87687bca4ee51bc70ce0d44f5f09270` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
