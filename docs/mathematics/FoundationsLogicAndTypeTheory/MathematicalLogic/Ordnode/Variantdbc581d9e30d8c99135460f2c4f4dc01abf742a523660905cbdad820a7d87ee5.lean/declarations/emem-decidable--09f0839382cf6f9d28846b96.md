## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a1add28431832b86daea32444510f892929d5d6cadb78b882a0317fda42810ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 382–405.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
instance Emem.decidable (x : α) [DecidableEq α] (t : Ordnode α) : Decidable (Emem x t) :=

/-- O(n). Approximate membership in the set, that is, whether some element in the
set is equivalent to this one in the preorder. This is useful primarily for stating
correctness properties; use `∈` for a version that actually uses the BST property
of the tree.

```
Amem 2 {1, 2, 3} = true
Amem 4 {1, 2, 3} = false
```

To see the difference with `Emem`, we need a preorder that is not a partial order.
For example, suppose we compare pairs of numbers using only their first coordinate. Then:
-- TODO: Verify below example
```
Emem (0, 1) {(0, 0), (1, 2)} = false
Amem (0, 1) {(0, 0), (1, 2)} = true
(0, 1) ∈ {(0, 0), (1, 2)} = true
```

The `∈` relation is equivalent to `Amem` as long as the `Ordnode` is well formed,
and should always be used instead of `Amem`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Ordnode/Variantdbc581d9e30d8c99135460f2c4f4dc01abf742a523660905cbdad820a7d87ee5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Ordnode/Variantdbc581d9e30d8c99135460f2c4f4dc01abf742a523660905cbdad820a7d87ee5.lean#L382).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `22dd577583faffd5d22288e97e76369f34286493` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
