## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:451a59a3-a340-a251-0b2d-1b8a13aadf86`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 896–906.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem LiftRel.trans (R : α → α → Prop) (H : Transitive R) : Transitive (LiftRel R) :=
  fun _ _ _ ⟨l1, r1⟩ ⟨l2, r2⟩ =>
  ⟨fun {_} a1 =>
    let ⟨_, b2, ab⟩ := l1 a1
    let ⟨c, c3, bc⟩ := l2 b2
    ⟨c, c3, H ab bc⟩,
    fun {_} c3 =>
    let ⟨_, b2, bc⟩ := r2 c3
    let ⟨a, a1, ab⟩ := r1 b2
    ⟨a, a1, H ab bc⟩⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Computation/Variantf218677c889553e1c44ffbe72ccb9f718a01fa8c693b605804c7e776027e1791.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Computation/Variantf218677c889553e1c44ffbe72ccb9f718a01fa8c693b605804c7e776027e1791.lean#L896).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ebe8d97b4ddb957ba5f058f8a84862604c0ad3d1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
