## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d3e77a44-ce94-c995-2835-b15b40f8a7e0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1226–1232.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem liftRel_congr {R : α → β → Prop} {ca ca' : Computation α} {cb cb' : Computation β}
    (ha : ca ~ ca') (hb : cb ~ cb') : LiftRel R ca cb ↔ LiftRel R ca' cb' :=
  and_congr
    (forall_congr' fun _ => imp_congr (ha _) <| exists_congr fun _ => and_congr (hb _) Iff.rfl)
    (forall_congr' fun _ => imp_congr (hb _) <| exists_congr fun _ => and_congr (ha _) Iff.rfl)
#align computation.lift_gcongr Computation.liftRel_congr

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Computation/Variant02750af67c0b90993dcf2fc4a483f39d43147bfa5a5549a9f591a72728b299be.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Computation/Variant02750af67c0b90993dcf2fc4a483f39d43147bfa5a5549a9f591a72728b299be.lean#L1226).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f3090b10a49d03b4cc4569cbe1374c466ccfaab5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
