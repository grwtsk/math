## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ba6a36e0-d197-a4b8-4bd0-28d83554bcb9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 180–187.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma detp_eq_of_row_eq {p q : n} (hpq : p ≠ q) (hrow : A.row p = A.row q)
    (s : ℤˣ := 1) (t : ℤˣ := -1) : A.detp s = A.detp t := by
  have : A.detp 1 = A.detp (-1) := sum_equiv (.mulRight <| swap p q) (by simp [hpq])
    fun _ _ ↦ prod_equiv (swap p q) (by simp) (by aesop (add simp row))
  obtain rfl | rfl := Int.units_eq_one_or s <;>
  obtain rfl | rfl := Int.units_eq_one_or t <;>
  first | rfl | rw [this]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/SemiringInverse/Variant8cd3bf6ceff4afb5d32f3679def5312b3ba12ce2644ecd7d382e77a0fb128fba.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/SemiringInverse/Variant8cd3bf6ceff4afb5d32f3679def5312b3ba12ce2644ecd7d382e77a0fb128fba.lean#L180).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aabc647d2f943a3db8da0cc3ca693e58493dc58b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
