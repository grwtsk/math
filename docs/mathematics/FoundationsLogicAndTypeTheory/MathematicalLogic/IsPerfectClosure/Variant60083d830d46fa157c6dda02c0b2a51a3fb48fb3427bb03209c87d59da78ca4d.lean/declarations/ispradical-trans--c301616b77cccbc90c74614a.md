## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:863b1b08-28c8-a2c2-483b-46a9fd9f5528`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 177–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsPRadical.trans [IsPRadical i p] [IsPRadical f p] :
    IsPRadical (f.comp i) p where
  pow_mem' x := by
    obtain ⟨n, y, hy⟩ := pow_mem f p x
    obtain ⟨m, z, hz⟩ := pow_mem i p y
    exact ⟨n + m, z, by rw [RingHom.comp_apply, hz, map_pow, hy, pow_add, pow_mul]⟩
  ker_le' x h := by
    rw [RingHom.mem_ker, RingHom.comp_apply, ← RingHom.mem_ker] at h
    simpa only [← Ideal.mem_comap, comap_pNilradical] using ker_le f p h

/-- If `i : K →+* L` is a `p`-radical ring homomorphism, then it makes `L` a perfect closure
of `K`, if `L` is perfect.
In this case the kernel of `i` is equal to the `p`-nilradical of `K`
(see `IsPerfectClosure.ker_eq`).

Our definition makes it synonymous to `IsPRadical` if `PerfectRing L p` is present. A caveat is
that you need to write `[PerfectRing L p] [IsPerfectClosure i p]`. This is similar to
`PerfectRing` which has `ExpChar` as a prerequisite. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/IsPerfectClosure/Variant60083d830d46fa157c6dda02c0b2a51a3fb48fb3427bb03209c87d59da78ca4d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/IsPerfectClosure/Variant60083d830d46fa157c6dda02c0b2a51a3fb48fb3427bb03209c87d59da78ca4d.lean#L177).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aee1e920dcf4be19326fb72d198c8bd4e6cc0ae1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
