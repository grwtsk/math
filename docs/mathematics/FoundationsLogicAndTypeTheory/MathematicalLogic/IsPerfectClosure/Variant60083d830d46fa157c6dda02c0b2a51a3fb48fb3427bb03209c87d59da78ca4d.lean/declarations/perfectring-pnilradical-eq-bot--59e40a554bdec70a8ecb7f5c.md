## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:09ddfbd8-fd05-0ad1-4104-48af88a826c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 130–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem PerfectRing.pNilradical_eq_bot (R : Type*) [CommSemiring R] (p : ℕ) [ExpChar R p]
    [PerfectRing R p] : pNilradical R p = ⊥ :=
  pNilradical_eq_bot_of_frobenius_inj R p (injective_frobenius R p)

section IsPerfectClosure

variable {K L M N : Type*}

section CommSemiring

variable [CommSemiring K] [CommSemiring L] [CommSemiring M]
  (i : K →+* L) (j : K →+* M) (f : L →+* M) (p : ℕ)

/-- If `i : K →+* L` is a ring homomorphism of characteristic `p` rings, then it is called
`p`-radical if the following conditions are satisfied:

- For any element `x` of `L` there is `n : ℕ` such that `x ^ (p ^ n)` is contained in `K`.
- The kernel of `i` is contained in the `p`-nilradical of `K`.

It is a generalization of purely inseparable extension for fields. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/IsPerfectClosure/Variant60083d830d46fa157c6dda02c0b2a51a3fb48fb3427bb03209c87d59da78ca4d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/IsPerfectClosure/Variant60083d830d46fa157c6dda02c0b2a51a3fb48fb3427bb03209c87d59da78ca4d.lean#L130).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aee1e920dcf4be19326fb72d198c8bd4e6cc0ae1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
