## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b5b502515d4efe8a00c77dcf1ea2099826c98398ce96bc11808e7e6b1bef2e1a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–107.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Attempts to generate a `Nontrivial α` hypothesis.

The tactic first checks to see that there is not already a `Nontrivial α` instance
before trying to synthesize one using other techniques.

If the goal is an (in)equality, the type `α` is inferred from the goal.
Otherwise, the type needs to be specified in the tactic invocation, as `nontriviality α`.

The `nontriviality` tactic will first look for strict inequalities amongst the hypotheses,
and use these to derive the `Nontrivial` instance directly.

Otherwise, it will perform a case split on `Subsingleton α ∨ Nontrivial α`, and attempt to discharge
the `Subsingleton` goal using `simp [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ, nontriviality]`, where `[h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` is
a list of additional `simp` lemmas that can be passed to `nontriviality` using the syntax
`nontriviality α using h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ`.

```

  nontriviality -- There is now a `Nontrivial R` hypothesis available.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Core/Variant766259f6d9b1dbf481284e103bcbb383a2341cf3414d3308516bede0f639585d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Core/Variant766259f6d9b1dbf481284e103bcbb383a2341cf3414d3308516bede0f639585d.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f40a8712d19a792ab4b513f8f41b2d28f37e02fe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
