## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:02387a52e2bfa1bdf2606bcd3c12b31bfaca8c47e5ad703cac3ff6f7203bc5f3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2073–2095.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def rec
    (f : (a : α) → motive (Quotient.mk s a))
    (h : (a b : α) → (p : a ≈ b) → Eq.ndrec (f a) (Quotient.sound p) = f b)
    (q : Quotient s)
    : motive q :=
  Quot.rec f h q

/--
A dependent recursion principle for `Quotient`. It is analogous to the
[recursor](lean-manual://section/recursors) for a structure, and can be used when the resulting type
is not necessarily a proposition.

While it is very general, this recursor can be tricky to use. The following simpler alternatives may
be easier to use:

 * `Quotient.lift` is useful for defining non-dependent functions.
 * `Quotient.ind` is useful for proving theorems about quotients.
 * `Quotient.recOnSubsingleton` can be used whenever the target type is a `Subsingleton`.
 * `Quotient.hrecOn` uses heterogeneous equality instead of rewriting with `Quotient.sound`.

`Quotient.rec` is a version of this recursor that takes the quotient parameter last.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Core/Varianta427efee8bddaa213003c7eae599a6f9db359b30e10b312e997a29580bad0cf9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Core/Varianta427efee8bddaa213003c7eae599a6f9db359b30e10b312e997a29580bad0cf9.lean#L2073).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1fab3e725a3b89d0f36bba9b929c61cb1a68b3c4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
