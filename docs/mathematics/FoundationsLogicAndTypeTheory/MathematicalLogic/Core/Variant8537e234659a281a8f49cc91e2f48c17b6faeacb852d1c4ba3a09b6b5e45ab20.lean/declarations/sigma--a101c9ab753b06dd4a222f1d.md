## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1504c1f7e8e60118530eeb6fc922414483b6d498c355c2b83dee57d03c9a110e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 266–300.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Sigma {α : Type u} (β : α → Type v) where
  /--
  Constructs a dependent pair.

  Using this constructor in a context in which the type is not known usually requires a type
  ascription to determine `β`. This is because the desired relationship between the two values can't
  generally be determined automatically.
  -/
  mk ::
  /--
  The first component of a dependent pair.
  -/
  fst : α
  /--
  The second component of a dependent pair. Its type depends on the first component.
  -/
  snd : β fst

attribute [unbox] Sigma

/--
Fully universe-polymorphic dependent pairs, in which the second element's type depends on the value
of the first element and both types are allowed to be propositions. The type `PSigma β` is typically
written `Σ' a : α, β a` or `(a : α) ×' β a`.

In practice, this generality leads to universe level constraints that are difficult to solve, so
`PSigma` is rarely used in manually-written code. It is usually only used in automation that
constructs pairs of arbitrary types.

To pair a value with a proof that a predicate holds for it, use `Subtype`. To demonstrate that a
value exists that satisfies a predicate, use `Exists`. A dependent pair with a proposition as its
first component is not typically useful due to proof irrelevance: there's no point in depending on a
specific proof because all proofs are equal anyway.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Core/Variant8537e234659a281a8f49cc91e2f48c17b6faeacb852d1c4ba3a09b6b5e45ab20.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Core/Variant8537e234659a281a8f49cc91e2f48c17b6faeacb852d1c4ba3a09b6b5e45ab20.lean#L266).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c00f44d589c186526ee811958ab745a2b1078de6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
