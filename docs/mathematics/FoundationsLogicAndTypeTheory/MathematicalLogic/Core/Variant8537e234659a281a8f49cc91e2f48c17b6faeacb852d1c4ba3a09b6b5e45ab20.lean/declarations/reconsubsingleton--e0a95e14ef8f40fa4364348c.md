## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a97af131b04acb186baa0d283b0e8faef150db4adb2d53e907e716b883419cf6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2105–2119.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected abbrev recOnSubsingleton
    [h : (a : α) → Subsingleton (motive (Quotient.mk s a))]
    (q : Quotient s)
    (f : (a : α) → motive (Quotient.mk s a))
    : motive q :=
  Quot.recOnSubsingleton (h := h) q f

/--
A dependent recursion principle for `Quotient` that uses [heterogeneous
equality](lean-manual://section/HEq), analogous to a [recursor](lean-manual://section/recursors) for
a structure.

`Quotient.recOn` is a version of this recursor that uses `Eq` instead of `HEq`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Core/Variant8537e234659a281a8f49cc91e2f48c17b6faeacb852d1c4ba3a09b6b5e45ab20.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Core/Variant8537e234659a281a8f49cc91e2f48c17b6faeacb852d1c4ba3a09b6b5e45ab20.lean#L2105).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c00f44d589c186526ee811958ab745a2b1078de6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
