## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:94025b0c-6de2-fbbc-a980-4d39dc90ddd1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 315–329.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem boundaryClass_eq_zero_of_extends
    (B : TangentialExtensionBoundary certificate Obstruction)
    (h : B.extendsAcrossTrace) : B.boundaryClass = 0 :=
  B.extends_iff_vanishes.mp h

end TangentialExtensionBoundary

/--
The product-framed belt sphere and the resulting reverse surgery.

This is additional evidence, not a consequence of the abstract surgery
operation alone.  In the classical model the belt embedding has dimensions
`(q - 1, p + 1)` and dual surgery restores the original manifold relative to
the exterior.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Core/Varianta0788c80c7a60804a7a22fb187473f15883e115c34d18a7afdb5c9079e3ee9f3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Core/Varianta0788c80c7a60804a7a22fb187473f15883e115c34d18a7afdb5c9079e3ee9f3.lean#L315).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4a71178157f432c03afb416a36e1ac691a893a55` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
