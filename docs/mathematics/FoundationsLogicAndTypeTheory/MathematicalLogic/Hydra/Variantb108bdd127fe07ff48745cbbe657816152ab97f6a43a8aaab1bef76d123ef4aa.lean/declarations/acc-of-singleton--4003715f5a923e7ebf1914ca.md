## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ae101f13-2a99-eaeb-68fd-80d521327b0c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 165–175.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem acc_of_singleton [Std.Irrefl r] {s : Multiset α} (hs : ∀ a ∈ s, Acc (CutExpand r) {a}) :
    Acc (CutExpand r) s := by
  induction s using Multiset.induction with
  | empty => exact Acc.intro 0 fun s h ↦ (not_cutExpand_zero s h).elim
  | cons a s ihs =>
    rw [← s.singleton_add a]
    rw [forall_mem_cons] at hs
    exact (hs.1.prod_gameAdd <| ihs fun a ha ↦ hs.2 a ha).of_fibration _ (cutExpand_fibration r)

/-- A singleton `{a}` is accessible under `CutExpand r` if `a` is accessible under `r`,
  assuming `r` is irreflexive. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Hydra/Variantb108bdd127fe07ff48745cbbe657816152ab97f6a43a8aaab1bef76d123ef4aa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Hydra/Variantb108bdd127fe07ff48745cbbe657816152ab97f6a43a8aaab1bef76d123ef4aa.lean#L165).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7c28aadca9d8496de326ed625e8a7da060bd4e54` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
