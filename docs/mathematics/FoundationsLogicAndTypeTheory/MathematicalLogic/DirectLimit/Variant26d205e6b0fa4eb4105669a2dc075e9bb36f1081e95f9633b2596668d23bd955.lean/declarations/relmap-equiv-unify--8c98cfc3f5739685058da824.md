## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4b388639-66c6-bf24-81ff-075a38b9e285`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 214–220.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem relMap_equiv_unify {n : ℕ} (R : L.Relations n) (x : Fin n → Σˣ f) (i : ι)
    (hi : i ∈ upperBounds (range (Sigma.fst ∘ x))) :
    RelMap R x = RelMap R (unify f x i hi) :=
  relMap_unify_equiv G f R x (Classical.choose (Finite.bddAbove_range fun a => (x a).1)) i _ hi

/-- The direct limit `setoid` respects the structure `sigmaStructure`, so quotienting by it
  gives rise to a valid structure. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/DirectLimit/Variant26d205e6b0fa4eb4105669a2dc075e9bb36f1081e95f9633b2596668d23bd955.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/DirectLimit/Variant26d205e6b0fa4eb4105669a2dc075e9bb36f1081e95f9633b2596668d23bd955.lean#L214).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `665bb197c4fd955fb43a7c0e13287472d455a730` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
