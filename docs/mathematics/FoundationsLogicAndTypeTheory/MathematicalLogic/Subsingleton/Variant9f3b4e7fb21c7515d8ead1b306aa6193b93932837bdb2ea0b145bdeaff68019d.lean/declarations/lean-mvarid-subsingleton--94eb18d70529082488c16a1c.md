## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:64ac2d158b63c7feecb06ff620b727f3180af03063574aebbb51c75d70be2286`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–134.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

namespace Mathlib.Tactic

/--
The `subsingleton` tactic tries to prove a goal of the form `x = y` or `HEq x y`
using the fact that the types involved are *subsingletons*
(a type with exactly zero or one terms).
To a first approximation, it does `apply Subsingleton.elim`.
As a nicety, `subsingleton` first runs the `intros` tactic.

- If the goal is an equality, it either closes the goal or fails.
- `subsingleton [inst1, inst2, ...]` can be used to add additional `Subsingleton` instances
  to the local context. This can be more flexible than
  `have := inst1; have := inst2; ...; subsingleton` since the tactic does not require that
  all placeholders be solved for.

Techniques the `subsingleton` tactic can apply:
- proof irrelevance
- heterogeneous proof irrelevance (via `proof_irrel_heq`)
- using `Subsingleton` (via `Subsingleton.elim`)
- proving `BEq` instances are equal if they are both lawful (via `lawful_beq_subsingleton`)

### Properties

The tactic is careful not to accidentally specialize `Sort _` to `Prop`,
avoiding the following surprising behavior of `apply Subsingleton.elim`:
```lean
example (α : Sort _) (x y : α) : x = y := by apply Subsingleton.elim
```
The reason this `example` goes through is that
it applies the `∀ (p : Prop), Subsingleton p` instance,
specializing the universe level metavariable in `Sort _` to `0`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Subsingleton/Variant9f3b4e7fb21c7515d8ead1b306aa6193b93932837bdb2ea0b145bdeaff68019d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Subsingleton/Variant9f3b4e7fb21c7515d8ead1b306aa6193b93932837bdb2ea0b145bdeaff68019d.lean#L62).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
