## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fe9b836d-16f4-fa13-b232-9bf23c2eb455`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 106–120.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem stale_slots_counterexample :
    ∃ before after : Packed Nat Nat,
      before.dictionary.length = after.dictionary.length ∧
      before.references = after.references ∧
      Valid before ∧ Valid after ∧
      unpack before = some [(11, 7), (12, 8)] ∧
      unpack after = some [(11, 8), (12, 7)] ∧
      unpack before ≠ unpack after := by
  refine ⟨⟨[7, 8], [(11, 0), (12, 1)]⟩, ⟨[8, 7], [(11, 0), (12, 1)]⟩,

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/FiniteSequences/DictionaryRevision__SourceOccurrenceaca87234f3b7037a7f107897.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Logic/FiniteSequences/DictionaryRevision.lean#L106).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dde26c2acdad67f4422d40f96551275941224051` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
