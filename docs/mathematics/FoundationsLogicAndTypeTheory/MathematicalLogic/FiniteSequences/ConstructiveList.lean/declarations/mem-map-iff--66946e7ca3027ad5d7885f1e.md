## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c5f43206-f629-16be-083c-a8a7f6b5d3cd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 101–124.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_map_iff {b : β} {f : α → β} {xs : List α} :
    b ∈ xs.map f ↔ ∃ a, a ∈ xs ∧ f a = b := by
  induction xs with
  | nil =>
      constructor
      · intro member
        cases member
      · intro member
        obtain ⟨a, impossible, _same⟩ := member
        cases impossible
  | cons a xs ih =>
      constructor
      · intro member
        cases member with
        | head => exact ⟨a, List.Mem.head xs, rfl⟩
        | tail _ member =>
            obtain ⟨x, old, same⟩ := ih.mp member
            exact ⟨x, List.Mem.tail a old, same⟩
      · intro member
        obtain ⟨x, old, same⟩ := member
        cases old with
        | head => cases same; exact List.Mem.head (xs.map f)
        | tail _ old => exact List.Mem.tail (f a) (ih.mpr ⟨x, old, same⟩)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/FiniteSequences/ConstructiveList.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/FiniteSequences/ConstructiveList.lean#L101).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dcf215013572aef296345cce70a270690c10770a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
