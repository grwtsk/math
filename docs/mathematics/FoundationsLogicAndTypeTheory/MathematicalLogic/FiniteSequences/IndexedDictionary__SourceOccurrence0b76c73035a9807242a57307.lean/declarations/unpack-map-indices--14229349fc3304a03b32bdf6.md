## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dde23758-28fc-c9d6-e945-66dec09fe2d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–108.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem unpack_map_indices (dictionary : List Payload)
    (entries : List (Key × Payload))
    (h : ∀ entry ∈ entries, entry.2 ∈ dictionary) :
    (entries.map (fun entry => (entry.1, dictionary.idxOf entry.2))).mapM
      (decodeReference dictionary) = some entries := by
  induction entries with
  | nil => rfl
  | cons entry entries ih =>
    have hentry : entry.2 ∈ dictionary := h entry (List.mem_cons_self ..)
    have htail : ∀ e ∈ entries, e.2 ∈ dictionary :=
      fun e he => h e (List.mem_cons_of_mem _ he)
    simp [List.mapM_cons, decodeReference_index_of_mem dictionary entry.1 entry.2 hentry,
      ih htail]

/-- Exact round trip: source keys, payloads, multiplicity, and order all survive. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/FiniteSequences/IndexedDictionary__SourceOccurrence0b76c73035a9807242a57307.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/FiniteSequences/IndexedDictionary.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ecf0105e1883c7074d68264248ef1cea613e480c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
