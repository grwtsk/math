## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6748d03a-3e68-97f4-c812-014d5e10ae32`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 814–825.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem range_eq_top_of_surjective (f : R →+* S) (hf : Function.Surjective f) :
    f.range = (⊤ : Subring S) :=
  range_eq_top.2 hf

@[deprecated (since := "2024-11-11")] alias range_top_of_surjective := range_eq_top_of_surjective

section eqLocus

variable {S : Type v} [Semiring S]

/-- The subring of elements `x : R` such that `f x = g x`, i.e.,
  the equalizer of f and g as a subring of R -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantc36eab7655719b3af230d236f007b7849b6f9eb8b1dfea78414a87262c252aba.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantc36eab7655719b3af230d236f007b7849b6f9eb8b1dfea78414a87262c252aba.lean#L814).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `26203b4a63e35d3f0779f2efe43b3559db3f204d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
