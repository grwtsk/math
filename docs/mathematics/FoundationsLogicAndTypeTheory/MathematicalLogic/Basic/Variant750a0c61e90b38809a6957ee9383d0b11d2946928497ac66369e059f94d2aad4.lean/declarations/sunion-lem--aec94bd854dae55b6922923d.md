## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:84bb3235-61da-f329-20d5-f1a5e9e38f2a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 433–450.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sUnion_lem {α β : Type u} (A : α → PSet) (B : β → PSet) (αβ : ∀ a, ∃ b, Equiv (A a) (B b)) :
    ∀ a, ∃ b, Equiv ((sUnion ⟨α, A⟩).Func a) ((sUnion ⟨β, B⟩).Func b)
  | ⟨a, c⟩ => by
    let ⟨b, hb⟩ := αβ a
    induction ea : A a with | _ γ Γ
    induction eb : B b with | _ δ Δ
    rw [ea, eb] at hb
    obtain ⟨γδ, δγ⟩ := hb
    let c : (A a).Type := c
    let ⟨d, hd⟩ := γδ (by rwa [ea] at c)
    use ⟨b, Eq.ndrec d (Eq.symm eb)⟩
    change PSet.Equiv ((A a).Func c) ((B b).Func (Eq.ndrec d eb.symm))
    match A a, B b, ea, eb, c, d, hd with
    | _, _, rfl, rfl, _, _, hd => exact hd

/-- The union operator, the collection of elements of elements of a ZFC set. Uses `⋃₀` notation,
scoped under the `ZFSet` namespace.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant750a0c61e90b38809a6957ee9383d0b11d2946928497ac66369e059f94d2aad4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant750a0c61e90b38809a6957ee9383d0b11d2946928497ac66369e059f94d2aad4.lean#L433).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `72394d313f57fea6043736884947c9c575c9851e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
