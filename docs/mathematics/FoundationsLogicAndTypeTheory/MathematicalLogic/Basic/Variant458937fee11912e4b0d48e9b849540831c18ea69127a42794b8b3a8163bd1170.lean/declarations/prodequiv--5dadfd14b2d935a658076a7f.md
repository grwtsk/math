## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9dd1ad8a262acf97aa8c1f8b1146d88e86a1b82f9462f31e14cf4fe243c843d4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 685–692.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def prodEquiv (s : NonUnitalSubring R) (t : NonUnitalSubring S) : s.prod t ≃+* s × t :=
  { Equiv.Set.prod (s : Set R) (t : Set S) with
    map_mul' := fun _ _ => rfl
    map_add' := fun _ _ => rfl }

/-- The underlying set of a non-empty directed Sup of `NonUnitalSubring`s is just a union of the
`NonUnitalSubring`s. Note that this fails without the directedness assumption (the union of two
`NonUnitalSubring`s is typically not a `NonUnitalSubring`) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant458937fee11912e4b0d48e9b849540831c18ea69127a42794b8b3a8163bd1170.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant458937fee11912e4b0d48e9b849540831c18ea69127a42794b8b3a8163bd1170.lean#L685).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `51f43b7ee3ee4812328721cab6dbe0d7bb3b43d0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
