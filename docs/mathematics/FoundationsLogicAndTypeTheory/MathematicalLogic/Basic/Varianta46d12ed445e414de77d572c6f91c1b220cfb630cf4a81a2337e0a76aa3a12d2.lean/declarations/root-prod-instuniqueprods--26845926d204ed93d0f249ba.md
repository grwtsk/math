## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:081b77af4bc262c0012616e3f8c57d3d9555a5eb19ccde38b4697e059717ff0c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 450–460.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[to_additive] instance _root_.Prod.instUniqueProds [UniqueProds G] [UniqueProds H] :
    UniqueProds (G × H) := by
  have : ∀ b, UniqueProds (I G H b) := Bool.rec ?_ ?_
  · exact of_injective_mulHom (downMulHom H) down_injective ‹_›
  · refine of_injective_mulHom (Prod.upMulHom G H) (fun x y he => Prod.ext ?_ ?_)
      (UniqueProds.instForall <| I G H) <;> apply up_injective
    exacts [congr_fun he false, congr_fun he true]
  · exact of_injective_mulHom (downMulHom G) down_injective ‹_›

end UniqueProds

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Varianta46d12ed445e414de77d572c6f91c1b220cfb630cf4a81a2337e0a76aa3a12d2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Varianta46d12ed445e414de77d572c6f91c1b220cfb630cf4a81a2337e0a76aa3a12d2.lean#L450).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `15b3375ff0df90c69ac361cf1919ca9ccf60b9e1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
