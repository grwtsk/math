## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d985ea45-12d1-51eb-3eba-c7837f0ee149`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 259–273.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pmap_eq_some_iff {hf} {y : β} :
    pmap f x hf = some y ↔ ∃ (a : α) (H : x = some a), f a (hf a H) = y := by
  rcases x with (_|x)
  · simp only [not_mem_none, exists_false, pmap, not_false_iff, exists_prop_of_false]
  · constructor
    · intro h
      simp only [pmap, Option.some_inj] at h
      refine ⟨x, rfl, h⟩
    · rintro ⟨a, H, rfl⟩
      simp only [mem_def, Option.some_inj] at H
      simp only [H, pmap]
#align option.pmap_eq_some_iff Option.pmap_eq_some_iff

-- Porting note: Can't simp tag this anymore because `join` and `pmap` simplify
-- @[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantb3f6d0e59d961329db6976b3a653c47c68790df3a6a100c74bc2436145aea05e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantb3f6d0e59d961329db6976b3a653c47c68790df3a6a100c74bc2436145aea05e.lean#L259).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `26ff16f49f3a8512719f470555698d0451a216a0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
