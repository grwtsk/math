## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7af143752124017d6abacd8bb678a2d33bb918db1dad6f08c43471aa4653adb4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1013–1025.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def associatesEquivOfUniqueUnits : Associates α ≃* α where
  toFun := Associates.out
  invFun := Associates.mk
  left_inv := Associates.mk_out
  right_inv _ := (Associates.out_mk _).trans <| normalize_eq _
  map_mul' := Associates.out_mul

end UniqueUnit

variable [CommRing α] [NormalizedGCDMonoid α]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant8906dc0ef3a68fb525c66626163e5de1cf95d57884a5a6cde9b64d550cb6f5ed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant8906dc0ef3a68fb525c66626163e5de1cf95d57884a5a6cde9b64d550cb6f5ed.lean#L1013).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b496921362123a127f10ba3de7ae3fbf9e5290b9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
