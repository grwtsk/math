## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a64eb6c1-afb8-6c63-5b78-6375ac8357a5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 930–934.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_Iic_Iio_of_subset_of_subset {s : Set α} (ho : Iio a ⊆ s) (hc : s ⊆ Iic a) :
    s ∈ ({Iic a, Iio a} : Set (Set α)) :=
  @mem_Ici_Ioi_of_subset_of_subset αᵒᵈ _ a s ho hc
#align set.mem_Iic_Iio_of_subset_of_subset Set.mem_Iic_Iio_of_subset_of_subset

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant7be99c69f41b3bc22936070b93f7a99b0bc68dd3485a3d23bc387de2070da945.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant7be99c69f41b3bc22936070b93f7a99b0bc68dd3485a3d23bc387de2070da945.lean#L930).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `619c8b648301f612408f28b6d64959fbfaa5539c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
