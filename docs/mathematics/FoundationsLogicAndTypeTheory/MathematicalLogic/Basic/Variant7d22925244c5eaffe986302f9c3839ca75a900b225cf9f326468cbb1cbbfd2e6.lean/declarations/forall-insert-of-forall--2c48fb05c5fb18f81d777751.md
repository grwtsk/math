## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9d52cd1b-2bfd-7535-effc-557bf0ca2e2e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1249–1255.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem forall_insert_of_forall {P : α → Prop} {a : α} {s : Set α} (H : ∀ x, x ∈ s → P x) (ha : P a)
    (x) (h : x ∈ insert a s) : P x :=
  h.elim (fun e => e.symm ▸ ha) (H _)
#align set.forall_insert_of_forall Set.forall_insert_of_forall

/- Porting note: ∃ x ∈ insert a s, P x is parsed as ∃ x, x ∈ insert a s ∧ P x,
 where in Lean3 it was parsed as `∃ x, ∃ (h : x ∈ insert a s), P x` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant7d22925244c5eaffe986302f9c3839ca75a900b225cf9f326468cbb1cbbfd2e6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant7d22925244c5eaffe986302f9c3839ca75a900b225cf9f326468cbb1cbbfd2e6.lean#L1249).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3791d4ac08face2cfbaf545c00d66b5e0bd896db` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
