## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e183b4ad32b4bc8a70dcc8d4b41060e396b9f45234a3bb6a347aa59a6a1a6dec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 360–366.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def subtypeSigmaEquiv {α} (p : α → Type v) (q : α → Prop) : { y : Sigma p // q y.1 } ≃ Σ x :
    Subtype q, p x.1 :=
  ⟨fun x => ⟨⟨x.1.1, x.2⟩, x.1.2⟩, fun x => ⟨⟨x.1.1, x.2⟩, x.1.2⟩, fun _ => rfl,
    fun _ => rfl⟩

/-- A sigma type over a subtype is equivalent to the sigma set over the original type,
if the fiber is empty outside of the subset -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantaebd222a014dbea5faba58fe8f80b4c26808cd6003e2cff4889821e2c5d071be.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantaebd222a014dbea5faba58fe8f80b4c26808cd6003e2cff4889821e2c5d071be.lean#L360).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `94261d9af251a015efc523739fa0a047efe9a94d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
