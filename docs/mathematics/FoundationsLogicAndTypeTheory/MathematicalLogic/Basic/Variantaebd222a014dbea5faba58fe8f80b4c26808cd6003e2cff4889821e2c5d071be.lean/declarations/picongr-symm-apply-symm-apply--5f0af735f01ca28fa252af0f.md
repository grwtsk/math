## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c287481-e75b-9549-e29a-a581e60669be`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 945–954.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem piCongr'_symm_apply_symm_apply (f : ∀ b, Z b) (b : β) :
    (h₁.piCongr' h₂).symm f (h₁.symm b) = (h₂ b).symm (f b) := by
  simp [piCongr', piCongr_apply_apply]

end

variable {α : Type*} {β : Type*} {f : α → β}

/-- A family of equivalences `∀ a, γ₁ a ≃ γ₂ a` generates an equivalence between the product
over the fibers of a function `f : α → β` on index types. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantaebd222a014dbea5faba58fe8f80b4c26808cd6003e2cff4889821e2c5d071be.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantaebd222a014dbea5faba58fe8f80b4c26808cd6003e2cff4889821e2c5d071be.lean#L945).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `94261d9af251a015efc523739fa0a047efe9a94d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
