## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ae0fb9e3b5853c9c86e21e2cf18c334eef135bd5a7f64c9d2e88d0ad7083040f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 712–722.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def gi : GaloisInsertion (@closure R _) (↑) where
  choice s _ := closure s
  gc _ _ := closure_le
  le_l_u _ := subset_closure
  choice_eq _ _ := rfl
#align non_unital_subsemiring.gi NonUnitalSubsemiring.gi

variable {R}
variable {F : Type*} [NonUnitalRingHomClass F R S]

/-- Closure of a non-unital subsemiring `S` equals `S`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant5f00f7425b48e47f30f4fea26657ab054a42050789e4f58e011cb478c7c75bbd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant5f00f7425b48e47f30f4fea26657ab054a42050789e4f58e011cb478c7c75bbd.lean#L712).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cf29df66698b4479158a7e4b8fbb8602c6d60df0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
