## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b62da22b5961abb207645f3a7986d3fec99819e69189f6171d7dcf0c8aa41d3a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 498–507.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev ReflectsLimits (F : C ⥤ D) :=
  ReflectsLimitsOfSize.{v₂, v₂} F

-- This should be used with explicit universe variables.
/-- A functor `F : C ⥤ D` reflects colimits if
whenever the image of a cocone over some `K : J ⥤ C` under `F` is a colimit cocone in `D`,
the cocone was already a colimit cocone in `C`.
Note that we do not assume a priori that `D` actually has any colimits.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantd5647f200797498c14abdd470500d5146aa4b70ffc941fe0fc65897cbba1b0fb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantd5647f200797498c14abdd470500d5146aa4b70ffc941fe0fc65897cbba1b0fb.lean#L498).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `21df45487c2d8a99162d7867f9050856863f14a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
