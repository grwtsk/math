## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:47b7e773ab28646c7a4b426eac8c6c4a020871a06f8003c24094a393d1ee41b9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 367–373.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def arrowCongrLeft {α : Sort u} {β : Sort v} {γ : Sort w} [Inhabited γ] (e : α ↪ β) :
    (α → γ) ↪ β → γ :=
  ⟨fun f => extend e f default, fun f₁ f₂ h =>
    funext fun x => by simpa only [e.injective.extend_apply] using congr_fun h (e x)⟩
#align function.embedding.arrow_congr_left Function.Embedding.arrowCongrLeft

/-- Restrict both domain and codomain of an embedding. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant2b89e589ee66d64f7a94f04d4dcd807b08a4e9564972eae274b8088c6a2bce32.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant2b89e589ee66d64f7a94f04d4dcd807b08a4e9564972eae274b8088c6a2bce32.lean#L367).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `28475ff9dc119f4d9e359b8e4444e22b9ad97217` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
