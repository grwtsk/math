## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:da7df094bc5511a0a1e1598c1965831f5676836c6d5184de25a2d928d4761942`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 211–220.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure RelEmbedding {α β : Type*} (r : α → α → Prop) (s : β → β → Prop) extends α ↪ β where
  /-- Elements are related iff they are related after apply a `RelEmbedding` -/
  map_rel_iff' : ∀ {a b}, s (toEmbedding a) (toEmbedding b) ↔ r a b
#align rel_embedding RelEmbedding

/-- A relation embedding with respect to a given pair of relations `r` and `s`
is an embedding `f : α ↪ β` such that `r a b ↔ s (f a) (f b)`. -/
infixl:25 " ↪r " => RelEmbedding

/-- The induced relation on a subtype is an embedding under the natural inclusion. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant286bd3cec2fe2107841d5de479461b1c3e3030eba1560d6b4c3a4bc6729cd5bb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant286bd3cec2fe2107841d5de479461b1c3e3030eba1560d6b4c3a4bc6729cd5bb.lean#L211).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb40f73a614171fb03f32ee7f47b2abbe02c63c2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
