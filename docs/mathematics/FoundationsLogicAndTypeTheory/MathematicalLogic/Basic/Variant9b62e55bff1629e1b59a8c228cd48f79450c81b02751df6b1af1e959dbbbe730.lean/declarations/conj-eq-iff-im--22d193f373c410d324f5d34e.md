## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5e3e6c43-1f4d-5adf-619d-8fc15861d526`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 586–594.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem conj_eq_iff_im {z : ℂ} : conj z = z ↔ z.im = 0 :=
  ⟨fun h => add_self_eq_zero.mp (neg_eq_iff_add_eq_zero.mp (congr_arg im h)), fun h =>
    ext rfl (neg_eq_iff_add_eq_zero.mpr (add_self_eq_zero.mpr h))⟩
#align complex.conj_eq_iff_im Complex.conj_eq_iff_im

-- `simpNF` complains about this being provable by `IsROrC.star_def` even
-- though it's not imported by this file.
-- Porting note: linter `simpNF` not found

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant9b62e55bff1629e1b59a8c228cd48f79450c81b02751df6b1af1e959dbbbe730.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant9b62e55bff1629e1b59a8c228cd48f79450c81b02751df6b1af1e959dbbbe730.lean#L586).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `db28a6adb957e834869f76e0c9fef938a2d00f21` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
