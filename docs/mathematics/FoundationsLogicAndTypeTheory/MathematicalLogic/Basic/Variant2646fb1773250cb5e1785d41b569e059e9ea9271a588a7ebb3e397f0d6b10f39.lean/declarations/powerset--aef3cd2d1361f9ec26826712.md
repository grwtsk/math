## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bd7cf22cf07d983da4d530e1a5558c0117c1d5d07eb61f45d67a789a9bcaf08f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 996–1010.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def powerset : ZFSet → ZFSet :=
  Resp.eval 1
    ⟨PSet.powerset, fun ⟨_, A⟩ ⟨_, B⟩ ⟨αβ, βα⟩ =>
      ⟨fun p =>
        ⟨{ b | ∃ a, p a ∧ Equiv (A a) (B b) }, fun ⟨a, pa⟩ =>
          let ⟨b, ab⟩ := αβ a
          ⟨⟨b, a, pa, ab⟩, ab⟩,
          fun ⟨_, a, pa, ab⟩ => ⟨⟨a, pa⟩, ab⟩⟩,
        fun q =>
        ⟨{ a | ∃ b, q b ∧ Equiv (A a) (B b) }, fun ⟨_, b, qb, ab⟩ => ⟨⟨b, qb⟩, ab⟩, fun ⟨b, qb⟩ =>
          let ⟨a, ab⟩ := βα b
          ⟨⟨a, b, qb, ab⟩, ab⟩⟩⟩⟩
#align Set.powerset ZFSet.powerset

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant2646fb1773250cb5e1785d41b569e059e9ea9271a588a7ebb3e397f0d6b10f39.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant2646fb1773250cb5e1785d41b569e059e9ea9271a588a7ebb3e397f0d6b10f39.lean#L996).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4bb41f5caedd0896a8cf8104dc9be2de61dc5ebc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
