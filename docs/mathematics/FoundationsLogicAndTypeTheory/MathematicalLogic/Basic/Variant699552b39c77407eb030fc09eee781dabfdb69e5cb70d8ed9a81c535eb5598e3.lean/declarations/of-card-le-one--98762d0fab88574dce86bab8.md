## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2f8f3caa-6f54-4c1f-a4e8-3cd40c24f72d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 91–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem of_card_le_one (hA : A.Nonempty) (hB : B.Nonempty) (hA1 : #A ≤ 1) (hB1 : #B ≤ 1) :
    ∃ a ∈ A, ∃ b ∈ B, UniqueMul A B a b := by
  rw [Finset.card_le_one_iff] at hA1 hB1
  obtain ⟨a, ha⟩ := hA; obtain ⟨b, hb⟩ := hB
  exact ⟨a, ha, b, hb, fun _ _ ha' hb' _ ↦ ⟨hA1 ha' ha, hB1 hb' hb⟩⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant699552b39c77407eb030fc09eee781dabfdb69e5cb70d8ed9a81c535eb5598e3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant699552b39c77407eb030fc09eee781dabfdb69e5cb70d8ed9a81c535eb5598e3.lean#L91).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `afd4bc8fc72ad3c204f81773e6c78e1b71f3b917` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
