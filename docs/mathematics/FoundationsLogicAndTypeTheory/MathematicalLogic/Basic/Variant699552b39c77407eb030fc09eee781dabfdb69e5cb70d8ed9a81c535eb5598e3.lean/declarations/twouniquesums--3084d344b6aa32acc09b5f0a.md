## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:00d5109e59b7f722532b9bbfb24f8ce25f3a9ea8d57e8058cb5b9ea15b7403fc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 250–258.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class TwoUniqueSums (G) [Add G] : Prop where
/-- For `A B` two finite sets whose product has cardinality at least 2,
  we can find at least two unique pairs. -/
  uniqueAdd_of_one_lt_card : ∀ {A B : Finset G}, 1 < #A * #B →
    ∃ p1 ∈ A ×ˢ B, ∃ p2 ∈ A ×ˢ B, p1 ≠ p2 ∧ UniqueAdd A B p1.1 p1.2 ∧ UniqueAdd A B p2.1 p2.2

/-- Let `G` be a Type with multiplication. `TwoUniqueProds G` asserts that any two non-empty
finite subsets of `G`, at least one of which is not a singleton, possesses at least two pairs
of elements satisfying the `UniqueMul` property. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant699552b39c77407eb030fc09eee781dabfdb69e5cb70d8ed9a81c535eb5598e3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant699552b39c77407eb030fc09eee781dabfdb69e5cb70d8ed9a81c535eb5598e3.lean#L250).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `afd4bc8fc72ad3c204f81773e6c78e1b71f3b917` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
