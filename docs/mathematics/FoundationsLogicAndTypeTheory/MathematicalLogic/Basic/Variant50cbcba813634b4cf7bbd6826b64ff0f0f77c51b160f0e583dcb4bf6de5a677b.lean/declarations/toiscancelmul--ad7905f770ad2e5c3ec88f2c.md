## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e68ec6a3-af62-4962-2e42-fdd87d727302`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 351–362.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[to_additive] theorem toIsCancelMul [UniqueProds G] : IsCancelMul G where
  mul_left_cancel := toIsLeftCancelMul.mul_left_cancel
  mul_right_cancel _ _ _ h :=
    op_injective <| toIsLeftCancelMul.mul_left_cancel _ <| unop_injective h

/-! Two theorems in [Andrzej Strojnowski, *A note on u.p. groups*][Strojnowski1980] -/

/-- `UniqueProds G` says that for any two nonempty `Finset`s `A` and `B` in `G`, `A × B`
  contains a unique pair with the `UniqueMul` property. Strojnowski showed that if `G` is
  a group, then we only need to check this when `A = B`.
  Here we generalize the result to cancellative semigroups.
  Non-cancellative counterexample: the AddMonoid `{0,1}` with 1+1=1. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant50cbcba813634b4cf7bbd6826b64ff0f0f77c51b160f0e583dcb4bf6de5a677b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant50cbcba813634b4cf7bbd6826b64ff0f0f77c51b160f0e583dcb4bf6de5a677b.lean#L351).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3af3a13d0165afd4873fbef728cf13bc78dc12fd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
