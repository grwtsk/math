## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:baa46f92-b867-d4b1-c3cf-89bced554644`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 714–720.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem cast_trans {α β γ : Type u} {r : α → α → Prop} {s : β → β → Prop}
    {t : γ → γ → Prop} (h₁ : α = β) (h₁' : β = γ) (h₂ : r ≍ s) (h₂' : s ≍ t) :
    (RelIso.cast h₁ h₂).trans (RelIso.cast h₁' h₂') = RelIso.cast (h₁.trans h₁') (h₂.trans h₂') :=
  ext fun x => by subst h₁; rfl

/-- A relation isomorphism is also a relation isomorphism between dual relations. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant63d44123279fe5a118eba96e4961663c7a6073ae10d6194dcd55c42d1cd9df13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant63d44123279fe5a118eba96e4961663c7a6073ae10d6194dcd55c42d1cd9df13.lean#L714).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `311540d0db8cb2155ba005e59cea661a8ae0004b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
