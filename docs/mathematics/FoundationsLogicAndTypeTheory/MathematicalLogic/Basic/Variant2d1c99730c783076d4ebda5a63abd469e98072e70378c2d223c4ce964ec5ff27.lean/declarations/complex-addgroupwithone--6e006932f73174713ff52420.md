## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:59d5a4996ae10ee84b0b7aebb5ef5944f3e0e3660036df8e675837571160701f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 413–431.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Complex.addGroupWithOne : AddGroupWithOne ℂ :=
  { Complex.addCommGroup with
    natCast := fun n => ⟨n, 0⟩
    natCast_zero := by
      ext <;> simp [Nat.cast, AddMonoidWithOne.natCast_zero]
    natCast_succ := fun _ => by ext <;> simp [Nat.cast, AddMonoidWithOne.natCast_succ]
    intCast := fun n => ⟨n, 0⟩
    intCast_ofNat := fun _ => by ext <;> rfl
    intCast_negSucc := fun n => by
      ext
      · simp [AddGroupWithOne.intCast_negSucc]
        show -(1: ℝ) + (-n) = -(↑(n + 1))
        simp [Nat.cast_add, add_comm]
      · simp [AddGroupWithOne.intCast_negSucc]
        show im ⟨n, 0⟩ = 0
        rfl
    one := 1 }

-- Porting note: proof needed modifications and rewritten fields
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant2d1c99730c783076d4ebda5a63abd469e98072e70378c2d223c4ce964ec5ff27.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant2d1c99730c783076d4ebda5a63abd469e98072e70378c2d223c4ce964ec5ff27.lean#L413).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8bd1286488b7b9fc73a9ca5796151cdd6dc400d7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
