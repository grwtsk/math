## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4edf3fd8-48cd-6fe9-16e1-796a51356eee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 68–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma ne_and_eq_iff_right {a b c : α} (h : b ≠ c) : a ≠ b ∧ a = c ↔ a = c :=
  and_iff_right_of_imp (fun h2 => h2.symm ▸ h.symm)

/-- Wrapper for adding elementary propositions to the type class systems.
Warning: this can easily be abused. See the rest of this docstring for details.

Certain propositions should not be treated as a class globally,
but sometimes it is very convenient to be able to use the type class system
in specific circumstances.

For example, `ZMod p` is a field if and only if `p` is a prime number.
In order to be able to find this field instance automatically by type class search,
we have to turn `p.prime` into an instance implicit assumption.

On the other hand, making `Nat.prime` a class would require a major refactoring of the library,
and it is questionable whether making `Nat.prime` a class is desirable at all.
The compromise is to add the assumption `[Fact p.prime]` to `ZMod.field`.

In particular, this class is not intended for turning the type class system
into an automated theorem prover for first order logic. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant86e03ce6c0fed7a4286d286be3db68a8dfb2563c7bf8bf0df644ae5376fd81fc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant86e03ce6c0fed7a4286d286be3db68a8dfb2563c7bf8bf0df644ae5376fd81fc.lean#L68).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac8393f46c7de3396e22382b15ad58ede775b4e2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
