## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c000b690-ae93-512a-92b6-d6ad36d7d791`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 297–302.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem toSubmonoid_mono : Monotone (fun s : Subring R => s.toSubmonoid) :=
  toSubmonoid_strictMono.monotone
#align subring.to_submonoid_mono Subring.toSubmonoid_mono

/-- Construct a `Subring R` from a set `s`, a submonoid `sm`, and an additive
subgroup `sa` such that `x ∈ s ↔ x ∈ sm ↔ x ∈ sa`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Varianta906e4862220090ea916a80e0aa72aa22fa736b1233b4eebe6662bd007e84e1f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Varianta906e4862220090ea916a80e0aa72aa22fa736b1233b4eebe6662bd007e84e1f.lean#L297).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `431dba68fd5824183f6ec9c077ed7e5c0364c5f4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
