## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1caffc079bfdf036561ba5c28d638470362fab6d8f44af782ba4120f3ad55be2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 860–868.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class HasUncurry (α : Type*) (β : outParam (Type*)) (γ : outParam (Type*)) where
  /-- Uncurrying operator. The most generic use is to recursively uncurry. For instance
  `f : α → β → γ → δ` will be turned into `↿f : α × β × γ → δ`. One can also add instances
  for bundled maps.-/
  uncurry : α → β → γ
#align function.has_uncurry Function.HasUncurry

notation:arg "↿" x:arg => HasUncurry.uncurry x

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant19b08924d3aeaa98ab53e63642bf70c259291e9ce68dab5836008bcdb9bde595.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant19b08924d3aeaa98ab53e63642bf70c259291e9ce68dab5836008bcdb9bde595.lean#L860).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `20e7575024a71bfc4ea4dda2317f5160f412262a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
