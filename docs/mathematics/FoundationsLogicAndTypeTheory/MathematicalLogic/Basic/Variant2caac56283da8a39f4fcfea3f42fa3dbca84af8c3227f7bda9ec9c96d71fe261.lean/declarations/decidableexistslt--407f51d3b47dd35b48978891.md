## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:57451c54703b28779ed49401eb65d3b81bad82263d2fd2f021e4f0f180e3355a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 933–940.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance decidableExistsLT {P : ℕ → Prop} [h : DecidablePred P] :
    DecidablePred fun n => ∃ m : ℕ, m < n ∧ P m
  | 0 => isFalse (by simp)
  | n + 1 =>
    @decidable_of_decidable_of_iff _ _ (@instDecidableOr _ _ (decidableExistsLT n) (h n))
      (by simp only [lt_succ_iff_lt_or_eq, or_and_right, exists_or, exists_eq_left]; apply Iff.refl)
#align nat.decidable_exists_lt Nat.decidableExistsLT

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant2caac56283da8a39f4fcfea3f42fa3dbca84af8c3227f7bda9ec9c96d71fe261.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant2caac56283da8a39f4fcfea3f42fa3dbca84af8c3227f7bda9ec9c96d71fe261.lean#L933).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cf4f33438c96f0f307a86aa754bae33cc7517887` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
