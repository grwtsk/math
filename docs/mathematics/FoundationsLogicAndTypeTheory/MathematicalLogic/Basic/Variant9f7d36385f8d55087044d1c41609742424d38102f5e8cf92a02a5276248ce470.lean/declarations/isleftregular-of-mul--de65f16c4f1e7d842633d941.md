## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8a831bef-1671-0f9f-a0fd-34057c405fd6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 132–138.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsLeftRegular.of_mul (ab : IsLeftRegular (a * b)) : IsLeftRegular b :=
  Function.Injective.of_comp (f := (a * ·)) (by rwa [comp_mul_left a b])

/-- An element is left-regular if and only if multiplying it on the left by a left-regular element
is left-regular. -/
@[to_additive (attr := simp) "An element is add-left-regular if and only if adding to it on the left
an add-left-regular element is add-left-regular."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant9f7d36385f8d55087044d1c41609742424d38102f5e8cf92a02a5276248ce470.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant9f7d36385f8d55087044d1c41609742424d38102f5e8cf92a02a5276248ce470.lean#L132).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3dc0f775361ae196ba17d54d7f7ddbb1599cb240` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
