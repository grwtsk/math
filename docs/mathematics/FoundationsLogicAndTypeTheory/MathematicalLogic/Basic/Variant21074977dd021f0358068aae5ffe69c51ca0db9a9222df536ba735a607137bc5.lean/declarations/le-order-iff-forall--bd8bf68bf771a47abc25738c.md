## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c2db59dd-b1f0-da24-552d-1ea35fb5a98b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 547–554.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem le_order_iff_forall [Zero Γ] {x : R⟦Γ⟧} {i : Γ} (h : x ≠ 0) :
    i ≤ x.order ↔ ∀ j < i, x.coeff j = 0 where
  mp hi j hj := coeff_eq_zero_of_lt_order (hj.trans_le hi)
  mpr H := by
    contrapose! h
    have := H _ h
    rwa [coeff_order_eq_zero] at this

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant21074977dd021f0358068aae5ffe69c51ca0db9a9222df536ba735a607137bc5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant21074977dd021f0358068aae5ffe69c51ca0db9a9222df536ba735a607137bc5.lean#L547).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
