## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:84709f630de24b2ba46a4bf759bd3870d8d4a34a9ccedc3aa04fcbd200c093c2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 179–193.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toIterate [PartialOrder Γ'] (x : R⟦Γ ×ₗ Γ'⟧) : R⟦Γ'⟧⟦Γ⟧ where
  coeff := fun g => {
    coeff := fun g' => coeff x (g, g')
    isPWO_support' := Set.PartiallyWellOrderedOn.fiberProdLex x.isPWO_support' g
  }
  isPWO_support' := by
    have h₁ : (Function.support fun g => HahnSeries.mk (fun g' => x.coeff (g, g'))
        (Set.PartiallyWellOrderedOn.fiberProdLex x.isPWO_support' g)) = Function.support
        fun g => fun g' => x.coeff (g, g') := by
      simp only [Function.support, ne_eq, mk_eq_zero]
    rw [h₁, Function.support_fun_curry x.coeff]
    exact Set.PartiallyWellOrderedOn.imageProdLex x.isPWO_support'

/-- The equivalence between iterated Hahn series and Hahn series on the lex product. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant21074977dd021f0358068aae5ffe69c51ca0db9a9222df536ba735a607137bc5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant21074977dd021f0358068aae5ffe69c51ca0db9a9222df536ba735a607137bc5.lean#L179).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9dbce948c0f6f66cc8d29bef2c916a4755f4cc87` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
