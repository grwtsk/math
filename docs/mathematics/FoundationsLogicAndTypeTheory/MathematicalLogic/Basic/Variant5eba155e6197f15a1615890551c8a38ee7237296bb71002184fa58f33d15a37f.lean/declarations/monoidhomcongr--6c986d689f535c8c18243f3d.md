## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d8fb728013c2f50db0e4a019623c308787fca03cedd9260627c91b337076066b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 89–108.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def monoidHomCongr {M N P Q} [MulOneClass M] [MulOneClass N] [CommMonoid P] [CommMonoid Q]
    (f : M ≃* N) (g : P ≃* Q) : (M →* P) ≃* (N →* Q) where
  toFun h := g.toMonoidHom.comp (h.comp f.symm.toMonoidHom)
  invFun k := g.symm.toMonoidHom.comp (k.comp f.toMonoidHom)
  left_inv h := by ext; simp
  right_inv k := by ext; simp
  map_mul' h k := by ext; simp

/-- A family of multiplicative equivalences `Π j, (Ms j ≃* Ns j)` generates a
multiplicative equivalence between `Π j, Ms j` and `Π j, Ns j`.

This is the `MulEquiv` version of `Equiv.piCongrRight`, and the dependent version of
`MulEquiv.arrowCongr`.

@[to_additive (attr := simps apply)
  "A family of additive equivalences `Π j, (Ms j ≃+ Ns j)`
  generates an additive equivalence between `Π j, Ms j` and `Π j, Ns j`.

  This is the `AddEquiv` version of `Equiv.piCongrRight`, and the dependent version of
  `AddEquiv.arrowCongr`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant5eba155e6197f15a1615890551c8a38ee7237296bb71002184fa58f33d15a37f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant5eba155e6197f15a1615890551c8a38ee7237296bb71002184fa58f33d15a37f.lean#L89).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f99afcdda0c5af4eac76c642493c1e4d89ec975e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
