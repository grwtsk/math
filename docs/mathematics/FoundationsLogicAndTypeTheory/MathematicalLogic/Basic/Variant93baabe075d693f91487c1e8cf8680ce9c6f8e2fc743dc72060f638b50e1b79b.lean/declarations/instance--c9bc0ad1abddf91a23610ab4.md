## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:731165134d8c4aeb2bddc6c13f6ad35f1b1714144942cc7c8f7d0aa87dbc5745`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 291–308.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) GroupWithZero.toDivisionMonoid : DivisionMonoid G₀ :=
  { ‹GroupWithZero G₀› with
    inv := Inv.inv,
    inv_inv := fun a => by
      by_cases h : a = 0
      · simp [h]
      · exact left_inv_eq_right_inv (inv_mul_cancel₀ <| inv_ne_zero h) (inv_mul_cancel₀ h)
        ,
    mul_inv_rev := fun a b => by
      by_cases ha : a = 0
      · simp [ha]
      by_cases hb : b = 0
      · simp [hb]
      apply inv_eq_of_mul
      simp [mul_assoc, ha, hb],
    inv_eq_of_mul := fun _ _ => inv_eq_of_mul }

-- see Note [lower instance priority]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant93baabe075d693f91487c1e8cf8680ce9c6f8e2fc743dc72060f638b50e1b79b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant93baabe075d693f91487c1e8cf8680ce9c6f8e2fc743dc72060f638b50e1b79b.lean#L291).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c39c9fcb4e9dcd52805533e5626a83106a8b6a8f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
