## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4106d058b04970cf0a9bb810841707ab76407a2916d43f8b6242d24c57c47681`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 473–483.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofMonotone [Std.Trichotomous r] [Std.Asymm s] (f : α → β) (H : ∀ a b, r a b → s (f a) (f b)) :
    r ↪r s := by
  haveI := @Std.Asymm.irrefl β s _
  refine ⟨⟨f, fun a b e => ?_⟩, @fun a b => ⟨fun h => ?_, H _ _⟩⟩
  · apply Std.Trichotomous.trichotomous (r := r) a b
    · exact fun h => irrefl (r := s) (f a) (by simpa [e] using H _ _ h)
    · exact fun h => irrefl (r := s) (f b) (by simpa [e] using H _ _ h)
  · refine Not.imp_symm (Std.Trichotomous.trichotomous a b · fun h' ↦ asymm (H _ _ h') h) ?_
    exact (irrefl _ <| · ▸ h)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant325cf59e0283754f3e467a57d137ce81f7bcd07aa77b10ca0edcd7fc9a086f17.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant325cf59e0283754f3e467a57d137ce81f7bcd07aa77b10ca0edcd7fc9a086f17.lean#L473).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `63108fa81f950b555e12044aba9a2599a0b5cd4a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
