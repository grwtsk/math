## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f96cf1f69a575eeda5c33ec6387a852f9ba4d6a0c6a9ad8898538b40d1cc3717`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1364–1384.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) : StrongNormalizedGCDMonoid G₀ where
  normUnit x := if h : x = 0 then 1 else (Units.mk0 x h)⁻¹
  normUnit_zero := dite_eq_left rfl
  normUnit_mul {x y} x0 y0 := Units.ext <| by simp [x0, y0, mul_comm]
  normUnit_coe_units u := by simp
  gcd a b := if a = 0 ∧ b = 0 then 0 else 1
  lcm a b := if a = 0 ∨ b = 0 then 0 else 1
  gcd_dvd_left a b := by simp +contextual
  gcd_dvd_right a b := by simp +contextual
  dvd_gcd {a b c} hac hab := by simp_all
  gcd_mul_lcm a b := by
    split_ifs <;> simp_all [Associated.comm]
  lcm_zero_left _ := ite_eq_left (Or.inl rfl)
  lcm_zero_right _ := ite_eq_left (Or.inr rfl)
  -- `split_ifs` wants to split `normalize`, so handle the cases manually
  normalize_gcd a b :=
    if h : a = 0 ∧ b = 0 then by simp [ite_eq_left h] else by simp [ite_eq_right h]
  normalize_lcm a b :=
    if h : a = 0 ∨ b = 0 then by simp [ite_eq_left h] else by simp [ite_eq_right h]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantd25d0648ca3de5e235e22d9b5e85635e5da2e1bec2b07d5af01d0ce7ae1bb8a0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantd25d0648ca3de5e235e22d9b5e85635e5da2e1bec2b07d5af01d0ce7ae1bb8a0.lean#L1364).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1f975a898c9caaaf40b3737fcbeb2a9ea6490c79` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
