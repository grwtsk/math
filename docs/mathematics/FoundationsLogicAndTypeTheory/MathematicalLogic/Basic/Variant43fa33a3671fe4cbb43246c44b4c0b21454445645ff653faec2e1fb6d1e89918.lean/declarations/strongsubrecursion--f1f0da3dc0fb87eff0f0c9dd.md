## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3b76441a7cda6fa678e7c014a9255bfa281380ce672483973c0a5e2f4e92d378`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 546–560.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def strongSubRecursion {P : ℕ → ℕ → Sort*} (H : ∀ a b, (∀ x y, x < a → y < b → P x y) → P a b) :
    ∀ n m : ℕ, P n m
  | n, m => H n m fun x y _ _ => strongSubRecursion H x y
#align nat.strong_sub_recursion Nat.strongSubRecursion

-- Porting note:
-- we can't put this on the definition itself because of
-- https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/1900
attribute [elab_as_elim] strongSubRecursion

/-- Given `P : ℕ → ℕ → Sort*`, if we have `P i 0` and `P 0 i` for all `i : ℕ`,
and for any `x y : ℕ` we can extend `P` from `(x,y+1)` and `(x+1,y)` to `(x+1,y+1)`
then we have `P n m` for all `n m : ℕ`.
Note that for non-`Prop` output it is preferable to use the equation compiler directly if possible,
since this produces equation lemmas. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant43fa33a3671fe4cbb43246c44b4c0b21454445645ff653faec2e1fb6d1e89918.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant43fa33a3671fe4cbb43246c44b4c0b21454445645ff653faec2e1fb6d1e89918.lean#L546).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `098ebfc22e883c6693f8a11bd08dca22b9a9302f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
