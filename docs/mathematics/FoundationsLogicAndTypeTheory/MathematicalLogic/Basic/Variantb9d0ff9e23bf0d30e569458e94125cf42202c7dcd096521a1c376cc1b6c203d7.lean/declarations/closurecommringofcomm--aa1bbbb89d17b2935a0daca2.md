## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:793dddb5357317ce774f35bc10dd45059e6f68ccaf2baa2f547c4b189ee358cb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 983–1000.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def closureCommRingOfComm {s : Set R} (hcomm : ∀ a ∈ s, ∀ b ∈ s, a * b = b * a) :
    CommRing (closure s) :=
  { (closure s).toRing with
    mul_comm := fun x y => by
      ext
      simp only [Subring.coe_mul]
      refine'
        closure_induction₂ x.prop y.prop hcomm (fun x => by simp only [mul_zero, zero_mul])
          (fun x => by simp only [mul_zero, zero_mul]) (fun x => by simp only [mul_one, one_mul])
          (fun x => by simp only [mul_one, one_mul])
          (fun x y hxy => by simp only [mul_neg, neg_mul, hxy])
          (fun x y hxy => by simp only [mul_neg, neg_mul, hxy])
          (fun x₁ x₂ y h₁ h₂ => by simp only [add_mul, mul_add, h₁, h₂])
          (fun x₁ x₂ y h₁ h₂ => by simp only [add_mul, mul_add, h₁, h₂])
          (fun x₁ x₂ y h₁ h₂ => by rw [← mul_assoc, ← h₁, mul_assoc x₁ y x₂, ← h₂, mul_assoc])
          fun x₁ x₂ y h₁ h₂ => by rw [← mul_assoc, h₁, mul_assoc, h₂, ← mul_assoc] }
#align subring.closure_comm_ring_of_comm Subring.closureCommRingOfComm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantb9d0ff9e23bf0d30e569458e94125cf42202c7dcd096521a1c376cc1b6c203d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantb9d0ff9e23bf0d30e569458e94125cf42202c7dcd096521a1c376cc1b6c203d7.lean#L983).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a7e91e6a598bac845be6974d92a6d9ab37dda03` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
