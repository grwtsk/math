## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6067776908479329bcc85212a60efc965d54239df4eb6e061f23b1ded0a279dc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1303–1310.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def subringCongr (h : s = t) : s ≃+* t :=
  { Equiv.setCongr <| congr_arg _ h with
    map_mul' := fun _ _ => rfl
    map_add' := fun _ _ => rfl }
#align ring_equiv.subring_congr RingEquiv.subringCongr

/-- Restrict a ring homomorphism with a left inverse to a ring isomorphism to its
`RingHom.range`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantb9d0ff9e23bf0d30e569458e94125cf42202c7dcd096521a1c376cc1b6c203d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantb9d0ff9e23bf0d30e569458e94125cf42202c7dcd096521a1c376cc1b6c203d7.lean#L1303).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a7e91e6a598bac845be6974d92a6d9ab37dda03` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
