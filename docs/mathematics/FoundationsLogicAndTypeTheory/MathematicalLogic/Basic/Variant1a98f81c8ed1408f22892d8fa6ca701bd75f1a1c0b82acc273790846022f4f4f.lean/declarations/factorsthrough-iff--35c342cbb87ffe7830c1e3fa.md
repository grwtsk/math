## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cff53015-ffca-4e7e-0659-a95df6f33a16`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 897–901.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma factorsThrough_iff (g : α → γ) [Nonempty γ] : g.FactorsThrough f ↔ ∃ (e : β → γ), g = e ∘ f :=
  ⟨fun hf => ⟨extend f g (const β (Classical.arbitrary γ)),
      funext (fun x => by simp only [comp_apply, hf.extend_apply])⟩,
  fun h _ _ hf => by rw [Classical.choose_spec h, comp_apply, comp_apply, hf]⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant1a98f81c8ed1408f22892d8fa6ca701bd75f1a1c0b82acc273790846022f4f4f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variant1a98f81c8ed1408f22892d8fa6ca701bd75f1a1c0b82acc273790846022f4f4f.lean#L897).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `232af472750295a454209a697754955e009c7428` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
