## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8bc318a9843b512c6bd78255d0735e7c8af70bbc58b20fd890a12dd6801f6939`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 37–53.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def listEquivLazyList (α : Type*) : List α ≃ LazyList α where
  toFun := LazyList.ofList
  invFun := LazyList.toList
  right_inv := by
    intro xs
    induction' xs using LazyList.rec with _ _ _ _ ih
    · rfl
    · simpa only [toList, ofList, cons.injEq, true_and]
    · rw [Thunk.get, ih]
  left_inv := by
    intro xs
    induction xs
    · rfl
    · simpa [ofList, toList]
#align lazy_list.list_equiv_lazy_list LazyList.listEquivLazyList

-- Porting note: Added a name to make the recursion work.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantf857e4aaef8e0f07738a01ee3a62cd5af85c2aa13b3e0855e9c007dcf2b0f957.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Basic/Variantf857e4aaef8e0f07738a01ee3a62cd5af85c2aa13b3e0855e9c007dcf2b0f957.lean#L37).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ca431d3a54edb12f731ec4395881ddb13b225b50` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
