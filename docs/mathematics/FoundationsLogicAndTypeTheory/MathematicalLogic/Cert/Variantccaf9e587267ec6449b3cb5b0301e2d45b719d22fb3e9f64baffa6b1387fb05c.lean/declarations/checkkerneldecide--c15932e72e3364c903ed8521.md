## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:35f2296a6cec6cbe418dec5c3b5ad5966a40dc44ca6714f4dc4aec38cf29d09c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 78–90.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def checkKernelDecide {u : Level} (α : Q(Type u)) : MetaM Unit := do
  have _cr : Q(CommRing $α) := ← synthInstanceQ q(CommRing $α)
  -- `Decidable` of the single equality rather than `DecidableEq`: a ring where equality
  -- is only decidable against zero should pass
  let some inst ← synthInstance? q(Decidable (((1 : ℤ) : $α) = 0))
    | throwError "equality with zero in the element type is not decidable{indentExpr α}"
  -- check if the equality reduced to a concrete false
  unless (Kernel.whnf (← getEnv) (← getLCtx) inst).toOption.any
      (·.isAppOf ``Decidable.isFalse) do
    throwError "equality in the element type does not reduce in the kernel{indentExpr α}"

/-- Prove the certificate condition `c` by a kernel-checked `decide`, with `name` naming
the condition in errors. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Cert/Variantccaf9e587267ec6449b3cb5b0301e2d45b719d22fb3e9f64baffa6b1387fb05c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Cert/Variantccaf9e587267ec6449b3cb5b0301e2d45b719d22fb3e9f64baffa6b1387fb05c.lean#L78).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ffcdbfde99b11389744b58363860ae652fa6f34` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
