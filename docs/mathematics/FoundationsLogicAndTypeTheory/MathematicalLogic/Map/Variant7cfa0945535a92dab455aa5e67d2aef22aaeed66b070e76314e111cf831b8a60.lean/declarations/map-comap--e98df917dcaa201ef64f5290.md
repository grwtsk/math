## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:63eff4a5-26d5-e4c1-83be-df78232729ca`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 472–479.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma map_comap {f : α → β} (h_range : N.E ⊆ range f) (hf : InjOn f (f ⁻¹' N.E)) :
    (N.comap f).map f hf = N := by
  refine ext_indep (by simpa [image_preimage_eq_iff]) ?_
  simp only [map_ground, comap_ground_eq, map_indep_iff, comap_indep_iff, forall_subset_image_iff]
  refine fun I hI ↦ ⟨fun ⟨I₀, ⟨hI₀, _⟩, hII₀⟩ ↦ ?_, fun h ↦ ⟨_, ⟨h, hf.mono hI⟩, rfl⟩⟩
  suffices h : I₀ ⊆ f ⁻¹' N.E by rw [InjOn.image_eq_image_iff hf hI h] at hII₀; rwa [hII₀]
  exact (subset_preimage_image f I₀).trans <| preimage_mono (f := f) hI₀.subset_ground

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Map/Variant7cfa0945535a92dab455aa5e67d2aef22aaeed66b070e76314e111cf831b8a60.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Map/Variant7cfa0945535a92dab455aa5e67d2aef22aaeed66b070e76314e111cf831b8a60.lean#L472).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2814bae8f8b0eac12adefb1c323b106ff93910c2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
