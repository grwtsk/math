## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:78f1acbf-a687-0cec-7ad4-3585645b6ff3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 370–375.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma closure_latticeClosure (s : Set α) : closure (latticeClosure s) = closure s :=
  le_antisymm (closure_le.2 latticeClosure_subset_closure) (closure_mono subset_latticeClosure)

/-- An induction principle for closure membership. If `p` holds for `⊥` and all elements of `s`, and
is preserved under suprema and complement, then `p` holds for all elements of the closure of `s`. -/
@[elab_as_elim]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/BooleanSubalgebra/Variant384ac00c27dbe687ce308415f2e10d70bc176de9c29ee7233d5dbc7be419e6be.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/BooleanSubalgebra/Variant384ac00c27dbe687ce308415f2e10d70bc176de9c29ee7233d5dbc7be419e6be.lean#L370).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `45fc4d57d3432abb17cb6a4137ed0d996e7bbc6c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
