## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:df7f5cb983affaf1f497597741d25a66ba581661f284b57f5ef0f860d3b420c8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 38–54.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ReplayLedger {Artifact : Type u} {Revision : Type v} {Claim : Type w}
    {Effect : Type x} {Grant : Type y} {Surface : Type z}
    (policy : ControllerPolicy (SourceSnapshot Artifact Revision) Claim Effect Grant Surface) where
  base : RevisionLedger policy
  replayArchive : List (ReplayArchivedClaim policy.statement)

section Admission

variable {Artifact : Type u} {Revision : Type v} {Claim : Type w}
  {Effect : Type x} {Grant : Type y} {Surface : Type z}
  [DecidableEq Claim]

local notation "Policy" =>
  ControllerPolicy (SourceSnapshot Artifact Revision) Claim Effect Grant Surface

/-- Every appended object is checked, every admitted claim is represented, and
all prerequisites are old verified claims or independently proved batch claims. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Certificates/AnchoredBatchVerification__SourceOccurrenced6e36faffda4f3eb7e1d39ed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Certificates/AnchoredBatchVerification.lean#L38).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ab7168cc31e1614279ce9ac3b74bd3d7696b34ba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
