## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5e15702b3dd744e1e1a698e9d87713148441bc23c12b0ca913ebafdd1cfd3e89`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 74–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ReplayLedger.admit (schema : DependencySchema Artifact Claim) (policy : Policy)
    (ledger : ReplayLedger policy) (admission : ReplayAdmission schema policy ledger) :
    ReplayLedger policy where
  base := {
    snapshot := ledger.base.snapshot
    pending := ledger.base.pending \ admission.claims
    verified := ledger.base.verified ∪ admission.claims
    issued := ledger.base.issued
    archive := ledger.base.archive
    receipts := ledger.base.receipts
    corrections := ledger.base.corrections }
  replayArchive := ledger.replayArchive ++ admission.records

/-- Each checked object is actually accepted at the unchanged current snapshot. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Certificates/AnchoredBatchVerification__SourceOccurrenced6e36faffda4f3eb7e1d39ed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Certificates/AnchoredBatchVerification.lean#L74).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ab7168cc31e1614279ce9ac3b74bd3d7696b34ba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
