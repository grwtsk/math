## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c94ac72-f2b7-00af-664c-5bd662967ba1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 109–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma predAbove_rev_left (p : Fin n) (i : Fin (n + 1)) :
    p.rev.predAbove i = (p.predAbove i.rev).rev := by
  obtain h | h := (rev i).succ_le_or_le_castSucc p
  · rw [predAbove_of_succ_le _ _ h, rev_pred,
      predAbove_of_le_castSucc _ _ (rev_succ _ ▸ (le_rev_iff.mpr h)), castPred_inj, rev_rev]
  · rw [predAbove_of_le_castSucc _ _ h, rev_castPred,
      predAbove_of_succ_le _ _ (rev_castSucc _ ▸ (rev_le_iff.mpr h)), pred_inj, rev_rev]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Rev/Variant01ae78cbfa80f206bfcd508e8cb4c3454a2ac8bc3374f56f7656d73c86f11d44.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Rev/Variant01ae78cbfa80f206bfcd508e8cb4c3454a2ac8bc3374f56f7656d73c86f11d44.lean#L109).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f70676de4ef874dbbd29022cbb1c89c0046d9b1c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
