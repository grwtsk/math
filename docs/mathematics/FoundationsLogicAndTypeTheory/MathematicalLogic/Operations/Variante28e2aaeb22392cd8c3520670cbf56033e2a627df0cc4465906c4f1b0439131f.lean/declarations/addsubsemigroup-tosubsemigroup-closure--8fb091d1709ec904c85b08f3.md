## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:da77d4ce-c2c5-7bf6-d71d-a8a519fb796f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 112–128.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem AddSubsemigroup.toSubsemigroup'_closure (S : Set (Additive M)) :
    AddSubsemigroup.toSubsemigroup' (AddSubsemigroup.closure S) =
      Subsemigroup.closure (Additive.ofMul ⁻¹' S) :=
  le_antisymm
    (AddSubsemigroup.toSubsemigroup'.le_symm_apply.1 <|
      AddSubsemigroup.closure_le.2 (Subsemigroup.subset_closure (M := M)))
    (Subsemigroup.closure_le.2 <| AddSubsemigroup.subset_closure (M := Additive M))

end

variable {A : Type*} [Add A]

/-- Additive subsemigroups of an additive semigroup `A` are isomorphic to
multiplicative subsemigroups of `Multiplicative A`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Operations/Variante28e2aaeb22392cd8c3520670cbf56033e2a627df0cc4465906c4f1b0439131f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Operations/Variante28e2aaeb22392cd8c3520670cbf56033e2a627df0cc4465906c4f1b0439131f.lean#L112).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27d2ebb5ac69629a914e13be4d3618fc60e96baa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
