## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1d39911d-365c-0be3-6e20-cb1be3066811`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 843–848.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma right_distrib_of_nonneg_of_ne_top {x : EReal} (hx_nonneg : 0 ≤ x)
    (hx_ne_top : x ≠ ⊤) (y z : EReal) :
    (y + z) * x = y * x + z * x := by
  simpa only [EReal.mul_comm] using left_distrib_of_nonneg_of_ne_top hx_nonneg hx_ne_top y z

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Operations/Variant6c3bbf7860a04abd3c5cad7e5b5d301d2fe350746ceff23a6901d79adce00c35.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Operations/Variant6c3bbf7860a04abd3c5cad7e5b5d301d2fe350746ceff23a6901d79adce00c35.lean#L843).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `de8f6d4ac43a66f5e5b4e0aaf583da465b90c2aa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
