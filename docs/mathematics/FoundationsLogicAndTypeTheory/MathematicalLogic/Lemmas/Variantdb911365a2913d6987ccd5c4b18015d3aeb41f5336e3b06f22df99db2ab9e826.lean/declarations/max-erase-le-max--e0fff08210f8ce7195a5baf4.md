## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0e9149a9-6fbb-9ff8-6f66-c444f01b065c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1792–1798.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem max?_erase_le_max? [TransCmp cmp] (h : t.WF) {k km kme} :
    (hkme : (t.erase k |>.max?) = some kme) →
    (hkm : (t.max?.get <|
      isSome_max?_of_isSome_max?_erase h <| hkme ▸ Option.isSome_some) = km) →
    cmp kme km |>.isLE :=
  TreeMap.Raw.maxKey?_erase_le_maxKey? h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Lemmas/Variantdb911365a2913d6987ccd5c4b18015d3aeb41f5336e3b06f22df99db2ab9e826.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Lemmas/Variantdb911365a2913d6987ccd5c4b18015d3aeb41f5336e3b06f22df99db2ab9e826.lean#L1792).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `88473b62fb0212be85f1300ff151ce437fb36282` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
