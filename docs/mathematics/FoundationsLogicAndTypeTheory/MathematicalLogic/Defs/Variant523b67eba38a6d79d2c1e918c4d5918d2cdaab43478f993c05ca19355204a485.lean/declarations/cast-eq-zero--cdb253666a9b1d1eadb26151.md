## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3de0692a-1e89-24b3-5c25-74e9d2f36922`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 66–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma cast_eq_zero : (p : R) = 0 := (cast_eq_zero_iff R p p).2 dvd_rfl

-- TODO: This lemma needs to be `@[simp]` for confluence in the presence of `CharP.cast_eq_zero` and
-- `Nat.cast_ofNat`, but with `no_index` on its entire LHS, it matches literally every expression so
-- is too expensive. If https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/2867 is fixed in a performant way, this can be made `@[simp]`.
--
-- @[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant523b67eba38a6d79d2c1e918c4d5918d2cdaab43478f993c05ca19355204a485.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant523b67eba38a6d79d2c1e918c4d5918d2cdaab43478f993c05ca19355204a485.lean#L66).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e6117189ae77222e4ba2bf4e63a2244afc5f13c2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
