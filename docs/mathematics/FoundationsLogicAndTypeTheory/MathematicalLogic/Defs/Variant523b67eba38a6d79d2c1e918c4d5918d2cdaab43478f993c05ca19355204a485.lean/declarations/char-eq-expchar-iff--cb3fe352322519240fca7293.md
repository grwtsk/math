## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7153b6bf-ecfd-f7dd-b78a-f5afba68a762`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 350–357.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma char_eq_expChar_iff (p q : ℕ) [hp : CharP R p] [hq : ExpChar R q] : p = q ↔ p.Prime := by
  rcases hq with q | hq_prime
  · rw [(CharP.eq R hp inferInstance : p = 0)]
    decide
  · exact ⟨fun hpq => hpq.symm ▸ hq_prime, fun _ => CharP.eq R hp ‹CharP R q›⟩

/-- The exponential characteristic is a prime number or one.
See also `CharP.char_is_prime_or_zero`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant523b67eba38a6d79d2c1e918c4d5918d2cdaab43478f993c05ca19355204a485.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant523b67eba38a6d79d2c1e918c4d5918d2cdaab43478f993c05ca19355204a485.lean#L350).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e6117189ae77222e4ba2bf4e63a2244afc5f13c2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
