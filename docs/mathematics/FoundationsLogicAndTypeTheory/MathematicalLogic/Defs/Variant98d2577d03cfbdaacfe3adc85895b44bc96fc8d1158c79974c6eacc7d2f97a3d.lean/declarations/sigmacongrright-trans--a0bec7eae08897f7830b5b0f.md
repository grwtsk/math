## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3ef7a137-6218-ba13-3af9-f848238ca451`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 739–745.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sigmaCongrRight_trans {α} {β₁ β₂ β₃ : α → Type*}
    (F : ∀ a, β₁ a ≃ β₂ a) (G : ∀ a, β₂ a ≃ β₃ a) :
    (sigmaCongrRight F).trans (sigmaCongrRight G) =
      sigmaCongrRight fun a => (F a).trans (G a) := rfl
#align equiv.sigma_congr_right_trans Equiv.sigmaCongrRight_trans

-- Porting note: simp can now simplify the LHS, so I have removed `@[simp]`
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant98d2577d03cfbdaacfe3adc85895b44bc96fc8d1158c79974c6eacc7d2f97a3d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant98d2577d03cfbdaacfe3adc85895b44bc96fc8d1158c79974c6eacc7d2f97a3d.lean#L739).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `75b56a0b9d635416e05acf39b2f84e2c965863ef` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
