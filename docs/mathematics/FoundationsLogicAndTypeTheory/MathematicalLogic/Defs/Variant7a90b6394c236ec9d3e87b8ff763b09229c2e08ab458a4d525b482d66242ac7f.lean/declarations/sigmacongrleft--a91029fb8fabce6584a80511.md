## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:372d760a15aee717d5dcf21b578d6410230aee9a6bf5b98bfc1d0fc3d437854e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 795–811.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simps apply] def sigmaCongrLeft {β : α₂ → Sort _} (e : α₁ ≃ α₂) :
    (Σ a : α₁, β (e a)) ≃ Σ a : α₂, β a where
  toFun a := ⟨e a.1, a.2⟩
  invFun a := ⟨e.symm a.1, (e.right_inv' a.1).symm ▸ a.2⟩
  -- porting note: this was a pretty gnarly match already, and it got worse after porting
  left_inv := fun ⟨a, b⟩ =>
    match (motive := ∀ a' (h : a' = a), Sigma.mk _ (congr_arg e h.symm ▸ b) = ⟨a, b⟩)
      e.symm (e a), e.left_inv a with
    | _, rfl => rfl
  right_inv := fun ⟨a, b⟩ =>
    match (motive := ∀ a' (h : a' = a), Sigma.mk a' (h.symm ▸ b) = ⟨a, b⟩)
      e (e.symm a), e.apply_symm_apply _ with
    | _, rfl => rfl

#align equiv.sigma_congr_left Equiv.sigmaCongrLeft

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant7a90b6394c236ec9d3e87b8ff763b09229c2e08ab458a4d525b482d66242ac7f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant7a90b6394c236ec9d3e87b8ff763b09229c2e08ab458a4d525b482d66242ac7f.lean#L795).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `782e9a48a71ac879243cbc6a07c1eb1bf641272f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
