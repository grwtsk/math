## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cd03049452117852fd877c8540035b0bcfa6681aa0862b65ca0b22775a3b35fc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 722–730.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def sigmaCongrRight {α} {β₁ β₂ : α → Type*} (F : ∀ a, β₁ a ≃ β₂ a) : (Σ a, β₁ a) ≃ Σ a, β₂ a where
  toFun a := ⟨a.1, F a.1 a.2⟩
  invFun a := ⟨a.1, (F a.1).symm a.2⟩
  left_inv | ⟨a, b⟩ => congr_arg (Sigma.mk a) <| symm_apply_apply (F a) b
  right_inv | ⟨a, b⟩ => congr_arg (Sigma.mk a) <| apply_symm_apply (F a) b
#align equiv.sigma_congr_right Equiv.sigmaCongrRight
#align equiv.sigma_congr_right_apply Equiv.sigmaCongrRight_apply

-- Porting note: simp can now simplify the LHS, so I have removed `@[simp]`
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant7a90b6394c236ec9d3e87b8ff763b09229c2e08ab458a4d525b482d66242ac7f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant7a90b6394c236ec9d3e87b8ff763b09229c2e08ab458a4d525b482d66242ac7f.lean#L722).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `782e9a48a71ac879243cbc6a07c1eb1bf641272f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
