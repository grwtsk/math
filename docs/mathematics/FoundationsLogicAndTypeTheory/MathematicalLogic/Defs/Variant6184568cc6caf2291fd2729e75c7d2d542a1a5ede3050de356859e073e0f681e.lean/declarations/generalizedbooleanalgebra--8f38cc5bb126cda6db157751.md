## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:02ad0f26aa49f21bd6f2ca70aa757bd20e710370ea7a0bfe51d39be26f5513d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–108.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class GeneralizedBooleanAlgebra (α : Type u) extends DistribLattice α, SDiff α, Bot α where
  /-- For any `a`, `b`, `(a ⊓ b) ⊔ (a / b) = a` -/
  sup_inf_sdiff : ∀ a b : α, a ⊓ b ⊔ a \ b = a
  /-- For any `a`, `b`, `(a ⊓ b) ⊓ (a / b) = ⊥` -/
  inf_inf_sdiff : ∀ a b : α, a ⊓ b ⊓ a \ b = ⊥

/-!
### Boolean algebras
-/


/-- A Boolean algebra is a bounded distributive lattice with a complement operator `ᶜ` such that
`x ⊓ xᶜ = ⊥` and `x ⊔ xᶜ = ⊤`. For convenience, it must also provide a set difference operation `\`
and a Heyting implication `⇨` satisfying `x \ y = x ⊓ yᶜ` and `x ⇨ y = y ⊔ xᶜ`.

This is a generalization of (classical) logic of propositions, or the powerset lattice.

Since `BoundedOrder`, `OrderBot`, and `OrderTop` are mixins that require `LE`
to be present at define-time, the `extends` mechanism does not work with them.
Instead, we extend using the underlying `Bot` and `Top` data typeclasses, and replicate the
order axioms of those classes here. A "forgetful" instance back to `BoundedOrder` is provided.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant6184568cc6caf2291fd2729e75c7d2d542a1a5ede3050de356859e073e0f681e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant6184568cc6caf2291fd2729e75c7d2d542a1a5ede3050de356859e073e0f681e.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `622da077d5fa71e2b4aa4668a9e86279e20cb29a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
