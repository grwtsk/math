## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:959ecbffe45cf21caa3ebb2a54f9acf2a290e2837ac398dfd99d8ba7b217afc2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–68.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class AddTorsor (G : outParam Type*) (P : Type*) [AddGroup G] extends AddAction G P,
  VSub G P where
  [nonempty : Nonempty P]
  /-- Torsor subtraction and addition with the same element cancels out. -/
  vsub_vadd' : ∀ p₁ p₂ : P, (p₁ -ᵥ p₂ : G) +ᵥ p₂ = p₁
  /-- Torsor addition and subtraction with the same element cancels out. -/
  vadd_vsub' : ∀ (g : G) (p : P), (g +ᵥ p) -ᵥ p = g

-- Porting note (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/12096): removed `nolint instance_priority`; lint not ported yet
attribute [instance 100] AddTorsor.nonempty

/-- An `AddGroup G` is a torsor for itself. -/
-- Porting note (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/12096): linter not ported yet
--@[nolint instance_priority]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant9e25e57d6160896406ce182c92a44045f42c5cb2c69e5479778a337e1cd5fcd6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant9e25e57d6160896406ce182c92a44045f42c5cb2c69e5479778a337e1cd5fcd6.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2f3154dd930c6cf1f2ebbb400371324783a3a92e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
