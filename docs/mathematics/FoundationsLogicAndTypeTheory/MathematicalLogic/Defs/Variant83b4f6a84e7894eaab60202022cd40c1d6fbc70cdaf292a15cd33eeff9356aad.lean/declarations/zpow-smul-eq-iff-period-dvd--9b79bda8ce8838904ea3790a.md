## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0e267054-8f37-5a05-b095-4b19a436d7c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 597–605.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem zpow_smul_eq_iff_period_dvd {j : ℤ} {g : G} {a : α} :
    g ^ j • a = a ↔ (period g a : ℤ) ∣ j := by
  match j with
  | (n : ℕ) => rw [zpow_natCast, Int.natCast_dvd_natCast, pow_smul_eq_iff_period_dvd]
  | -(n + 1 : ℕ) =>
    rw [zpow_neg, zpow_natCast, inv_smul_eq_iff, eq_comm, Int.dvd_neg, Int.natCast_dvd_natCast,
      pow_smul_eq_iff_period_dvd]

@[to_additive (attr := simp)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant83b4f6a84e7894eaab60202022cd40c1d6fbc70cdaf292a15cd33eeff9356aad.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant83b4f6a84e7894eaab60202022cd40c1d6fbc70cdaf292a15cd33eeff9356aad.lean#L597).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b1a24d13a4eadbfd3c434bbe9548bce54007cdd1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
