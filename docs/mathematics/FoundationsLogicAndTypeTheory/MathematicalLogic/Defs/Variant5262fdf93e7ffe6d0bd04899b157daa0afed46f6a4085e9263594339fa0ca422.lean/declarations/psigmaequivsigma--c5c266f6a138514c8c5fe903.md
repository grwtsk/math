## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:083482df24b40d77f5ef2169a36477fd0b55d0ac41cc5287d07cc4878b8afa9f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 574–581.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def psigmaEquivSigma {α} (β : α → Type*) : (Σ' i, β i) ≃ Σ i, β i where
  toFun a := ⟨a.1, a.2⟩
  invFun a := ⟨a.1, a.2⟩
  left_inv _ := rfl
  right_inv _ := rfl

/-- A `PSigma`-type is equivalent to the corresponding `Sigma`-type. -/
@[simps apply symm_apply]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant5262fdf93e7ffe6d0bd04899b157daa0afed46f6a4085e9263594339fa0ca422.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant5262fdf93e7ffe6d0bd04899b157daa0afed46f6a4085e9263594339fa0ca422.lean#L574).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e89ffc7eb45fb1f03cb6da018c328df73b326e8a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
