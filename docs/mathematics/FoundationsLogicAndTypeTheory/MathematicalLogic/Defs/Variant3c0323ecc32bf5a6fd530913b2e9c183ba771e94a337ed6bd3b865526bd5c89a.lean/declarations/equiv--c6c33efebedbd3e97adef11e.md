## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:975b291fd8b27234d6794ff4d4222ae3ac8f832fa3ee71a7d90a4a8b99a19cff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 75–92.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Equiv (α β : Sort*) where
  /-- The forward map of an equivalence.

  Do NOT use directly. Use the coercion instead. -/
  protected toFun : α → β
  /-- The backward map of an equivalence.

  Do NOT use `e.invFun` directly. Use the coercion of `e.symm` instead. -/
  protected invFun : β → α
  protected left_inv : LeftInverse invFun toFun := by intro; first | rfl | ext <;> rfl
  protected right_inv : RightInverse invFun toFun := by intro; first | rfl | ext <;> rfl

@[inherit_doc]
infixl:25 " ≃ " => Equiv

/-- Turn an element of a type `F` satisfying `EquivLike F α β` into an actual
`Equiv`. This is declared as the default coercion from `F` to `α ≃ β`. -/
@[coe]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant3c0323ecc32bf5a6fd530913b2e9c183ba771e94a337ed6bd3b865526bd5c89a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Defs/Variant3c0323ecc32bf5a6fd530913b2e9c183ba771e94a337ed6bd3b865526bd5c89a.lean#L75).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d565cfc00aa9772be8242f76a32eff891fdb6899` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
