## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eb13a23b-bed2-f26c-643b-836ad99df13b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 436–439.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem of_symm_image_eq (h : e.symm '' (e.target ∩ t) = e.source ∩ s) : e.IsImage s t :=
  of_preimage_eq <| Eq.trans (iff_preimage_eq.2 rfl).symm_image_eq.symm h
#align local_equiv.is_image.of_symm_image_eq LocalEquiv.IsImage.of_symm_image_eq

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/LocalEquiv/Variant0ef28416b586dfd1b473890796fa78b24cce951bff679765bdf3059639da2722.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/LocalEquiv/Variant0ef28416b586dfd1b473890796fa78b24cce951bff679765bdf3059639da2722.lean#L436).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
