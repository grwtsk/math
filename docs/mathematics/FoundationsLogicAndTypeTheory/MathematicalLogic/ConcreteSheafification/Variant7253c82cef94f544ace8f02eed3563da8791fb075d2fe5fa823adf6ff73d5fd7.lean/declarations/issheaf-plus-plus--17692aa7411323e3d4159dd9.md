## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:adb46b98-7c07-ace0-47c0-8c4a382ef93e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 427–441.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isSheaf_plus_plus (P : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ D) : Presheaf.IsSheaf J (J.plusObj (J.plusObj P)) := by
  apply isSheaf_of_sep
  intro X S x y
  apply sep

end

end Plus

variable (J)
variable [∀ (P : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ D) (X : C) (S : J.Cover X), HasMultiequalizer (S.index P)]
  [∀ X : C, HasColimitsOfShape (J.Cover X)ᵒᵖ D]

/-- The sheafification of a presheaf `P`.
*NOTE:* Additional hypotheses are needed to obtain a proof that this is a sheaf! -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/ConcreteSheafification/Variant7253c82cef94f544ace8f02eed3563da8791fb075d2fe5fa823adf6ff73d5fd7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/ConcreteSheafification/Variant7253c82cef94f544ace8f02eed3563da8791fb075d2fe5fa823adf6ff73d5fd7.lean#L427).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `15fbd156e1e9bdaa432240aca834e8b9fa948d66` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
