## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:19e96ca5edc7d9cfd17f5f02371a90966ec178c774944f61f366c268162b446a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 641–648.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def recOnSubsingleton' {φ : Quotient s₁ → Sort*} [∀ a, Subsingleton (φ ⟦a⟧)]
    (q : Quotient s₁)
    (f : ∀ a, φ (Quotient.mk'' a)) : φ q :=
  Quotient.recOnSubsingleton q f

/-- A version of `Quotient.recOnSubsingleton₂` taking `{s₁ : Setoid α} {s₂ : Setoid α}`
as implicit arguments instead of instance arguments. -/
@[elab_as_elim]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Quot/Variant9f823c9af2aef1a5cf88f2fd06e74e38bc3c9139d9aef1f29e6e91b0182292e3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Quot/Variant9f823c9af2aef1a5cf88f2fd06e74e38bc3c9139d9aef1f29e6e91b0182292e3.lean#L641).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `12e821417ec92e0e00b044fafceb90c656b25c62` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
