## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6db093e8359cd63267c0edb1947e30aa8af16f766437aaec96969d826f0265d7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 212–233.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (r : α → α → Prop) (s : β → β → Prop) (q₁ : Quot r) (q₂ : Quot s) (f : α → β → Prop)
    (ha : ∀ a b₁ b₂, s b₁ b₂ → f a b₁ = f a b₂) (hb : ∀ a₁ a₂ b, r a₁ a₂ → f a₁ b = f a₂ b)
    [∀ a, DecidablePred (f a)] :
    Decidable (Quot.liftOn₂ q₁ q₂ f ha hb) :=
  Quot.lift₂.decidablePred _ _ _ _ _ _ _

end Quot

namespace Quotient

variable [sa : Setoid α] [sb : Setoid β]

variable {φ : Quotient sa → Quotient sb → Sort*}

-- Porting note: in mathlib3 this notation took the Setoid as an instance-implicit argument,
-- now it's explicit but left as a metavariable.
-- We have not yet decided which one works best, since the setoid instance can't always be
-- reliably found but it can't always be inferred from the expected type either.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Quot/Variantb191e4d4312aa4e67ff3f05f50b91e4a012ca613ca913caa0281e593e0cbb06e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Quot/Variantb191e4d4312aa4e67ff3f05f50b91e4a012ca613ca913caa0281e593e0cbb06e.lean#L212).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7640ea28751428e78f6a1131e840e5dc77afc399` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
