## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8b5d3dc2-74d6-dd67-31ba-9512492ebbd9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 397–413.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lim_eq_zero_iff (f : CauSeq β abv) : lim f = 0 ↔ LimZero f :=
  ⟨fun h => by
    have hf := equiv_lim f
    rw [h] at hf
    exact (limZero_congr hf).mpr (const_limZero.mpr rfl),
   fun h => by
    have h₁ : f = f - const abv 0 := ext fun n => by simp [sub_apply, const_apply]
    rw [h₁] at h
    exact lim_eq_of_equiv_const h⟩
#align cau_seq.lim_eq_zero_iff CauSeq.lim_eq_zero_iff

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/CauSeqCompletion/Variant2c8b0988f608a9c7977f003b4e30fa8c713afbbedef891dd3d1817ce894d9270.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/CauSeqCompletion/Variant2c8b0988f608a9c7977f003b4e30fa8c713afbbedef891dd3d1817ce894d9270.lean#L397).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8e456629b37dbfeb6c870ef83bb49fccd3d25afd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
