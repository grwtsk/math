## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b0fda8a6-6d72-c2d3-5965-f55050a8c32d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 173–183.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma hasProjectiveDimensionLT_X₃ (h₁ : HasProjectiveDimensionLT S.X₁ n)
    (h₂ : HasProjectiveDimensionLT S.X₂ (n + 1)) :
    HasProjectiveDimensionLT S.X₃ (n + 1) := by
  letI := HasExt.standard C
  rw [hasProjectiveDimensionLT_iff]
  rintro (_ | i) hi Y x₃
  · simp at hi
  · obtain ⟨x₁, rfl⟩ := Ext.contravariant_sequence_exact₃ hS _ x₃
      (Ext.eq_zero_of_hasProjectiveDimensionLT _ (n + 1) hi) (add_comm _ _)
    rw [x₁.eq_zero_of_hasProjectiveDimensionLT n (by omega), Ext.comp_zero]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Dimension/Variant5413dc6400dfb4450db0b8d57ee47c1dd54ba99e3c5874d799685ab27474d7a4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Dimension/Variant5413dc6400dfb4450db0b8d57ee47c1dd54ba99e3c5874d799685ab27474d7a4.lean#L173).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `732e58383896be4ce3350a0404f58ad85a720f32` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
