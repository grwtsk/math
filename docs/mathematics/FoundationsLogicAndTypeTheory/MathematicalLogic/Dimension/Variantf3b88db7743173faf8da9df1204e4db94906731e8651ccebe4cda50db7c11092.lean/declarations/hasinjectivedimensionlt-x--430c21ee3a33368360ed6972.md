## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b105a9fa-eeb2-ae81-827d-245f7ff37041`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 207–217.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma hasInjectiveDimensionLT_X₁ (h₁ : HasInjectiveDimensionLT S.X₃ n)
    (h₂ : HasInjectiveDimensionLT S.X₂ (n + 1)) :
    HasInjectiveDimensionLT S.X₁ (n + 1) := by
  let := HasExt.standard C
  rw [hasInjectiveDimensionLT_iff]
  rintro (_ | i) hi Y x₃
  · simp at hi
  · obtain ⟨x₁, rfl⟩ := Ext.covariant_sequence_exact₁ _ hS x₃
      (Ext.eq_zero_of_hasInjectiveDimensionLT _ (n + 1) hi) rfl
    rw [x₁.eq_zero_of_hasInjectiveDimensionLT n (by lia), Ext.zero_comp]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Dimension/Variantf3b88db7743173faf8da9df1204e4db94906731e8651ccebe4cda50db7c11092.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Dimension/Variantf3b88db7743173faf8da9df1204e4db94906731e8651ccebe4cda50db7c11092.lean#L207).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1411411a6997a92ee1cea1cf719a7666e4b3c85d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
