## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ad88861fc4b2988a436d096db1953bc9b2dc7fe9e4373f4328d56b64c604c8ba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 128–136.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mulRepHom : rightFDRep (k := k) (G := G) ⊗ rightFDRep ⟶ rightFDRep where
  hom := ofHom (LinearMap.mul' k (G → k))
  comm := by
    intro
    ext u
    refine TensorProduct.induction_on u rfl (fun _ _ ↦ rfl) (fun _ _ hx hy ↦ ?_)
    simp only [map_add, hx, hy]

/-- The `rightFDRep` component of `η : Aut (forget k G)` preserves multiplication -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Tannaka/Variant952c69c12507965b6f6eaf24fc1facaf35bb5ba552002f01e628d1cb321c8be9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Tannaka/Variant952c69c12507965b6f6eaf24fc1facaf35bb5ba552002f01e628d1cb321c8be9.lean#L128).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9e12d007b31b53ce0d180168bb036d6a99d88bec` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
