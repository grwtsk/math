## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:29d5d46a-ca92-e694-c433-59c5a40712db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 42–50.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem invertible_edge_equiv {x y : V} (h : G.InvertibleEdge x y) :
    Nonempty ((G.interface x).Carrier ≃ (G.interface y).Carrier) := by
  obtain ⟨e, _, hs, ht, hi⟩ := h
  subst x y
  cases hb : (G.admitted e).evidence with
  | invertible b => exact ⟨b.toEquiv⟩
  | directional b => simp [hb, BridgeEvidence.IsInvertible] at hi

/-- A finite path can use admitted invertible edges in either direction. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Atlas/Variantf9ced3f8f220300dc4da1f99d94d04c8c948d1b57082de20b87def3218727aa5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Atlas/Variantf9ced3f8f220300dc4da1f99d94d04c8c948d1b57082de20b87def3218727aa5.lean#L42).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c5a20192601620f9a4f84987f46b7b2d9910db18` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
