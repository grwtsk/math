## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:78079242-c9df-528c-34f7-86d5dd851e44`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–92.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lie_abelian_iff_equiv_lie_abelian {R : Type u} {L₁ : Type v} {L₂ : Type w} [CommRing R]
    [LieRing L₁] [LieRing L₂] [LieAlgebra R L₁] [LieAlgebra R L₂] (e : L₁ ≃ₗ⁅R⁆ L₂) :
    IsLieAbelian L₁ ↔ IsLieAbelian L₂ :=
  ⟨e.symm.injective.isLieAbelian, e.injective.isLieAbelian⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Abelian/Variantbb2112fe4f4feb0f4bc658340d7b0b905fe1d883cf21fe4efd6f7b2e87167192.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/Abelian/Variantbb2112fe4f4feb0f4bc658340d7b0b905fe1d883cf21fe4efd6f7b2e87167192.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2f80d97203b5dee61a6e48759746642c5befc84d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
