## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a5d21b73c868d729e25f8edcda65cabe5dd7632d3546024f55e8b1daf3eb6b58`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 795–801.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Trans
    ((· ≤ ·) : PGame → PGame → Prop)
    ((· ≈ ·) : PGame → PGame → Prop)
    ((· ≤ ·) : PGame → PGame → Prop) where
  trans := le_of_le_of_equiv

@[trans]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/PGame/Variant00ca77301c91b4e7d4fac2e9c82421480b8b658788c79f1afb598a2327e7b9f8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/PGame/Variant00ca77301c91b4e7d4fac2e9c82421480b8b658788c79f1afb598a2327e7b9f8.lean#L795).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c586cfcc673384611c1256aa8fcc234322ca2517` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
