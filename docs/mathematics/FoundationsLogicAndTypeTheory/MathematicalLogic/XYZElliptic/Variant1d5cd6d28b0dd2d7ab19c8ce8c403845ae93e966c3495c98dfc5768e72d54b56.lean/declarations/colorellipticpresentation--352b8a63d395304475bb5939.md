## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1ebc1d688083016087cebdcdbb37eda8a49f20356b738bea3cea93434e88bc8a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 68–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ColorEllipticPresentation where
  presentationId : String
  g2Raw : Int
  g3Raw : Int
  discriminantRaw : Int
  nonsingular : Prop
  authority : RefactorAuthority := .presentationOnly

/-- The named V1 mapping is application-selected metadata, not a standard CIE
invariant extraction.  Singular values remain representable for cusp-style
rendering, but operations requiring an elliptic curve must pass the explicit
nonzero-discriminant gate below. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/XYZElliptic/Variant1d5cd6d28b0dd2d7ab19c8ce8c403845ae93e966c3495c98dfc5768e72d54b56.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/MathematicalLogic/XYZElliptic/Variant1d5cd6d28b0dd2d7ab19c8ce8c403845ae93e966c3495c98dfc5768e72d54b56.lean#L68).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `84062d389a1d448e9c943eb656bfc79af72b4723` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
