## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a54becb7adb39c213baa50f14a55b7d776fa01a931517a6c693df352d9dcce37`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 70–77.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def notionTargetLift (policy : ObservationPolicy Object Test Value) (budget : ℕ)
    (target : Object → Result) (determined : DeterminesAt policy budget target) :
    notionQuotient policy budget → Result :=
  descentQuotientLift (notionSetoid policy budget) target
    ((determines_iff_descendsThrough policy budget target).mp determined)

/-- The quotient target recovers the original target on each canonical class. -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/NotionDescent/Variantfa0ebfe2d519aea3ab9499c3f39cc64672c2b7a072cf481f131b45315d4e5480.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/NotionDescent/Variantfa0ebfe2d519aea3ab9499c3f39cc64672c2b7a072cf481f131b45315d4e5480.lean#L70).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f2d28b1b6a52afd6d8e95974a7c122eb11309e77` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
