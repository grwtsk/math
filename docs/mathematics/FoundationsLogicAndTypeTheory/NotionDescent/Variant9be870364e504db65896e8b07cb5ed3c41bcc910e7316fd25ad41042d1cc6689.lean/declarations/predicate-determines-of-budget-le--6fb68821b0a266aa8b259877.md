## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6c0f04f5-9782-b4a9-0079-677042443382`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 131–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem predicate_determines_of_budget_le {policy : ObservationPolicy Object Test Value}
    {small large : ℕ} {predicate : Object → Prop} (bound : small ≤ large)
    (determined : DeterminesPredicateAt policy small predicate) :
    DeterminesPredicateAt policy large predicate :=
  fun {_ _} hxy ↦ determined (observationallyEquivalent_of_budget_le bound hxy)

/-- Forgetting tests induces a transition from the larger-budget quotient to the smaller one. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/NotionDescent/Variant9be870364e504db65896e8b07cb5ed3c41bcc910e7316fd25ad41042d1cc6689.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/NotionDescent/Variant9be870364e504db65896e8b07cb5ed3c41bcc910e7316fd25ad41042d1cc6689.lean#L131).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d031cf8520ba784a8558cdb7a1215107ee8e1861` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
