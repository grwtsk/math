## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:07e85afe0777c187671393a68e94ef5f82d7146b26b9ff254a7c87d6fa51b4a2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 309–316.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def vaughanFactorIndex {N : ℕ} :
    VaughanFactorAtom N → VaughanScaleIndex N
  | .inl a => a.1
  | .inr (.inl a) => vaughanTypeI1FactorIndex a
  | .inr (.inr (.inl a)) => vaughanTypeI2FactorIndex a
  | .inr (.inr (.inr a)) => vaughanTypeIIFactorIndex a

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ConductorThreeTwistedVaughan/Variant42795c66cc7d773c63498ec44c2ce3a5eefaea8d3098d4d10ce25ef80ffa7421.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ConductorThreeTwistedVaughan/Variant42795c66cc7d773c63498ec44c2ce3a5eefaea8d3098d4d10ce25ef80ffa7421.lean#L309).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0eaf9778db5361fb950359f7330404bcca452a43` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
