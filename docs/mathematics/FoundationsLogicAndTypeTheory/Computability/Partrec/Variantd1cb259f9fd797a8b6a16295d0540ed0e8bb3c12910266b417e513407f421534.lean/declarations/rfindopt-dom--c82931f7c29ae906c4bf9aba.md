## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aabada55-2466-35e2-2634-98f07e097c25`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 141–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rfindOpt_dom {α} {f : ℕ → Option α} : (rfindOpt f).Dom ↔ ∃ n a, a ∈ f n :=
  ⟨fun h => (rfindOpt_spec ⟨h, rfl⟩).imp fun n h => ⟨_, h⟩, fun h => by
    have h' : ∃ n, (f n).isSome := h.imp fun n => Option.isSome_iff_exists.2
    have s := Nat.find_spec h'
    have fd : (rfind fun n => (f n).isSome).Dom :=
      ⟨Nat.find h', by simpa using s.symm, fun _ _ => trivial⟩
    refine' ⟨fd, _⟩
    have := rfind_spec (get_mem fd)
    simp at this ⊢
    cases' Option.isSome_iff_exists.1 this.symm with a e
    rw [e]; trivial⟩
#align nat.rfind_opt_dom Nat.rfindOpt_dom

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/Partrec/Variantd1cb259f9fd797a8b6a16295d0540ed0e8bb3c12910266b417e513407f421534.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/Partrec/Variantd1cb259f9fd797a8b6a16295d0540ed0e8bb3c12910266b417e513407f421534.lean#L141).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `88129181fdf2bdc1cf1c5bb461f5050b04b742ea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
