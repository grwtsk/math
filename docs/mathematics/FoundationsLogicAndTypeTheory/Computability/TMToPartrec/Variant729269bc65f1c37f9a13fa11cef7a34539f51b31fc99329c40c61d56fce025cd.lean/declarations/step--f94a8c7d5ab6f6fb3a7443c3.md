## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c63bfe03051d015870f76c6f256e2cbf3c28cd933ff0459bc24f03d416f84f0e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 524–540.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def step : Cfg → Option Cfg
  | Cfg.halt _ => none
  | Cfg.ret k v => some (stepRet k v)
#align turing.to_partrec.step Turing.ToPartrec.step

/-- In order to extract a compositional semantics from the sequential execution behavior of
configurations, we observe that continuations have a monoid structure, with `Cont.halt` as the unit
and `Cont.then` as the multiplication. `Cont.then k₁ k₂` runs `k₁` until it halts, and then takes
the result of `k₁` and passes it to `k₂`.

We will not prove it is associative (although it is), but we are instead interested in the
associativity law `k₂ (eval c k₁) = eval c (k₁.then k₂)`. This holds at both the sequential and
compositional levels, and allows us to express running a machine without the ambient continuation
and relate it to the original machine's evaluation steps. In the literature this is usually
where one uses Turing machines embedded inside other Turing machines, but this approach allows us
to avoid changing the ambient type `Cfg` in the middle of the recursion.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/TMToPartrec/Variant729269bc65f1c37f9a13fa11cef7a34539f51b31fc99329c40c61d56fce025cd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/TMToPartrec/Variant729269bc65f1c37f9a13fa11cef7a34539f51b31fc99329c40c61d56fce025cd.lean#L524).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5a6689a642cb737eed9cc443ce79432f68557e6a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
