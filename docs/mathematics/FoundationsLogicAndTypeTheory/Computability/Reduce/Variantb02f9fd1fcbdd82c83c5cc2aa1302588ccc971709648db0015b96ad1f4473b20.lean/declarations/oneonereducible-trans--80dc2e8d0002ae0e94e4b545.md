## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6821e7ba-b6b7-fd47-52df-3c75ab4ebf1d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 91–96.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem OneOneReducible.trans {α β γ} [Primcodable α] [Primcodable β] [Primcodable γ] {p : α → Prop}
    {q : β → Prop} {r : γ → Prop} : p ≤₁ q → q ≤₁ r → p ≤₁ r
  | ⟨f, c₁, i₁, h₁⟩, ⟨g, c₂, i₂, h₂⟩ =>
    ⟨g ∘ f, c₂.comp c₁, i₂.comp i₁, fun a =>
      ⟨fun h => by rw [comp_apply, ← h₂, ← h₁]; assumption, fun h => by rwa [h₁, h₂]⟩⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/Reduce/Variantb02f9fd1fcbdd82c83c5cc2aa1302588ccc971709648db0015b96ad1f4473b20.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/Reduce/Variantb02f9fd1fcbdd82c83c5cc2aa1302588ccc971709648db0015b96ad1f4473b20.lean#L91).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2ec4caeea6e983bb2194c3f3f2337524fe6fbf5f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
