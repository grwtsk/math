## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a8bde36f-9918-cf96-8377-7a53772ab8e0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 121–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem computable_of_manyOneReducible {p : α → Prop} {q : β → Prop} (h₁ : p ≤₀ q)
    (h₂ : ComputablePred q) : ComputablePred p := by
  rcases h₁ with ⟨f, c, hf⟩
  rw [show p = fun a => q (f a) from Set.ext hf]
  rcases computable_iff.1 h₂ with ⟨g, hg, rfl⟩
  exact ⟨by infer_instance, by simpa using hg.comp c⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/Reduce/Variantb02f9fd1fcbdd82c83c5cc2aa1302588ccc971709648db0015b96ad1f4473b20.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/Reduce/Variantb02f9fd1fcbdd82c83c5cc2aa1302588ccc971709648db0015b96ad1f4473b20.lean#L121).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2ec4caeea6e983bb2194c3f3f2337524fe6fbf5f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
