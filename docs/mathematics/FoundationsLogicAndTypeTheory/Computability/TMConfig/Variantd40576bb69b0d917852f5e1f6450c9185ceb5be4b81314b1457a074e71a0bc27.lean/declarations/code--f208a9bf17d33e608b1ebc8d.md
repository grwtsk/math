## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5398034f9394510179ff7344530192fec13addd73ea836a120f418ac6d4e5f39`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 81–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive Code
  | zero'
  | succ
  | tail
  | cons : Code → Code → Code
  | comp : Code → Code → Code
  | case : Code → Code → Code
  | fix : Code → Code
  deriving DecidableEq, Inhabited

/-- The semantics of the `Code` primitives, as partial functions `List ℕ →. List ℕ`. By convention
we functions that return a single result return a singleton `[n]`, or in some cases `n :: v` where
`v` will be ignored by a subsequent function.

* `zero'` appends a `0` to the input. That is, `zero' v = 0 :: v`.
* `succ` returns the successor of the head of the input, defaulting to zero if there is no head:
  * `succ [] = [1]`
  * `succ (n :: v) = [n + 1]`
* `tail` returns the tail of the input
  * `tail [] = []`
  * `tail (n :: v) = v`
* `cons f fs` calls `f` and `fs` on the input and conses the results:
  * `cons f fs v = (f v).head :: fs v`
* `comp f g` calls `f` on the output of `g`:
  * `comp f g v = f (g v)`
* `case f g` cases on the head of the input, calling `f` or `g` depending on whether it is zero or
  a successor (similar to `Nat.casesOn`).
  * `case f g [] = f []`
  * `case f g (0 :: v) = f v`
  * `case f g (n+1 :: v) = g (n :: v)`
* `fix f` calls `f` repeatedly, using the head of the result of `f` to decide whether to call `f`
  again or finish:
  * `fix f v = []` if `f v = []`
  * `fix f v = w` if `f v = 0 :: w`
  * `fix f v = fix f w` if `f v = n+1 :: w` (the exact value of `n` is discarded)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/TMConfig/Variantd40576bb69b0d917852f5e1f6450c9185ceb5be4b81314b1457a074e71a0bc27.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/TMConfig/Variantd40576bb69b0d917852f5e1f6450c9185ceb5be4b81314b1457a074e71a0bc27.lean#L81).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a8c8040b3bf85ea393560e6de1a257c3b2450957` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
