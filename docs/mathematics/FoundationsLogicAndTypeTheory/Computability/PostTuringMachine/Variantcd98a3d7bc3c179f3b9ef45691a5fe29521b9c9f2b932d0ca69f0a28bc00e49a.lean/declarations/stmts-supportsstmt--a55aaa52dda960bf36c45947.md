## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:34a0bf04-7b37-718e-0ff0-90b846f51e64`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 640–647.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem stmts_supportsStmt {M : Λ → Stmt Γ Λ σ} {S : Finset Λ} {q : Stmt Γ Λ σ}
    (ss : Supports M S) : some q ∈ stmts M S → SupportsStmt S q := by
  simp only [stmts, Finset.mem_insertNone, Finset.mem_biUnion, Option.mem_def, Option.some.injEq,
    forall_eq', exists_imp, and_imp]
  exact fun l ls h ↦ stmts₁_supportsStmt_mono h (ss.2 _ ls)

variable [Inhabited Γ]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/PostTuringMachine/Variantcd98a3d7bc3c179f3b9ef45691a5fe29521b9c9f2b932d0ca69f0a28bc00e49a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/PostTuringMachine/Variantcd98a3d7bc3c179f3b9ef45691a5fe29521b9c9f2b932d0ca69f0a28bc00e49a.lean#L640).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6ee1a79ce54aa340ecbff62a956332bd6748fbf8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
