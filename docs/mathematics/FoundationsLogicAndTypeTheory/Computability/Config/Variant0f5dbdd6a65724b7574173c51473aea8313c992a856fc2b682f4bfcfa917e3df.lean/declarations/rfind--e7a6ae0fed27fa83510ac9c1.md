## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:373a7deb45e9064d7dac8d992eab53aee4bbddafd9ec771925e828ac20a631b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 210–234.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def rfind (f : Code) : Code :=
  comp pred <| comp (fix <| cons f <| cons succ tail) zero'

/-- `prec f g` implements the `prec` (primitive recursion) operation of partial recursive
functions. `prec f g` evaluates as:

* `prec f g [] = [f []]`
* `prec f g (0 :: v) = [f v]`
* `prec f g (n+1 :: v) = [g (n :: prec f g (n :: v) :: v)]`

It is implemented as:

    G (a :: b :: IH :: v) = (b :: a+1 :: b-1 :: g (a :: IH :: v) :: v)
    F (0 :: f_v :: v) = (f_v :: v)
    F (n+1 :: f_v :: v) = (fix G (0 :: n :: f_v :: v)).tail.tail
    prec f g (a :: v) = [(F (a :: f v :: v)).head]

Because `fix` always evaluates its body at least once, we must special case the `0` case to avoid
calling `g` more times than necessary (which could be bad if `g` diverges). If the input is
`0 :: v`, then `F (0 :: f v :: v) = (f v :: v)` so we return `[f v]`. If the input is `n+1 :: v`,
we evaluate the function from the bottom up, with initial state `0 :: n :: f v :: v`. The first
number counts up, providing arguments for the applications to `g`, while the second number counts
down, providing the exit condition (this is the initial `b` in the return value of `G`, which is
stripped by `fix`). After the `fix` is complete, the final state is `n :: 0 :: res :: v` where
`res` is the desired result, and the rest reduces this to `[res]`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/Config/Variant0f5dbdd6a65724b7574173c51473aea8313c992a856fc2b682f4bfcfa917e3df.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/Config/Variant0f5dbdd6a65724b7574173c51473aea8313c992a856fc2b682f4bfcfa917e3df.lean#L210).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `958b743e6c161e2c6fc87571be26fd8b27ecf211` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
