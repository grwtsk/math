## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:982e6ce5273596bd156d3b4893797506c30ec3e153ac0f6994d8f7daf35e6e7e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1468–1476.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Inhabited Λ'₁₀ :=
  ⟨(some (M default), default)⟩

open TM0.Stmt

/-- The core TM1 → TM0 translation function. Here `s` is the current value on the tape, and the
`Stmt₁` is the TM1 statement to translate, with local state `v : σ`. We evaluate all regular
instructions recursively until we reach either a `move` or `write` command, or a `goto`; in the
latter case we emit a dummy `write s` step and transition to the new target location. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/TuringMachine/Variant686729c29c3bad58378660d8db3b4bd245ee86e09f30cc0f8886f3f50049b7ab.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/TuringMachine/Variant686729c29c3bad58378660d8db3b4bd245ee86e09f30cc0f8886f3f50049b7ab.lean#L1468).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `30890dff70be24bc3f7b22ac2b7a36e25d3765ab` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
