## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:60602d610a02d378ff26a39aa1938b69f458726d653d9164f38b5a4d217599a0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 423–431.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def stWrite {k : K} (v : σ) (l : List (Γ k)) : StAct K Γ σ k → List (Γ k)
  | push f => f v :: l
  | peek _ => l
  | pop _ => l.tail

/-- We have partitioned the TM2 statements into "stack actions", which require going to the end
of the stack, and all other actions, which do not. This is a modified recursor which lumps the
stack actions into one. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/TuringMachine/Varianta02eb2375b25369c3181b879eb6f790b91b442aa5c10730373682efc115f9107.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/TuringMachine/Varianta02eb2375b25369c3181b879eb6f790b91b442aa5c10730373682efc115f9107.lean#L423).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c14e91790357aeb78628835fe8af4a3d1cad9f8c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
