## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c65a50a9-7eed-91fb-ec45-7a4ec472f119`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 214–233.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem stmts₁_trans {q₁ q₂ : Stmt Γ Λ σ} : q₁ ∈ stmts₁ q₂ → stmts₁ q₁ ⊆ stmts₁ q₂ := by
  classical
  intro h₁₂ q₀ h₀₁
  induction q₂ with (
    simp only [stmts₁] at h₁₂ ⊢
    simp only [Finset.mem_insert, Finset.mem_singleton, Finset.mem_union] at h₁₂)
  | branch f q₁ q₂ IH₁ IH₂ =>
    rcases h₁₂ with (rfl | h₁₂ | h₁₂)
    · unfold stmts₁ at h₀₁
      exact h₀₁
    · exact Finset.mem_insert_of_mem (Finset.mem_union_left _ (IH₁ h₁₂))
    · exact Finset.mem_insert_of_mem (Finset.mem_union_right _ (IH₂ h₁₂))
  | goto l => subst h₁₂; exact h₀₁
  | halt => subst h₁₂; exact h₀₁
  | load  _ q IH | _ _ _ q IH =>
    rcases h₁₂ with (rfl | h₁₂)
    · unfold stmts₁ at h₀₁
      exact h₀₁
    · exact Finset.mem_insert_of_mem (IH h₁₂)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/TuringMachine/Varianta02eb2375b25369c3181b879eb6f790b91b442aa5c10730373682efc115f9107.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/TuringMachine/Varianta02eb2375b25369c3181b879eb6f790b91b442aa5c10730373682efc115f9107.lean#L214).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c14e91790357aeb78628835fe8af4a3d1cad9f8c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
