## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:515366d4-08b5-758d-7ef0-55858490808f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1256–1274.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem contSupp_supports {S k} (H : contSupp k ⊆ S) : Supports (contSupp k) S := by
  induction k with
  | halt => simp [contSupp_halt, Supports]
  | cons₁ f k IH =>
    have H₁ := H; rw [contSupp_cons₁] at H₁; have H₂ := Finset.union_subset_right H₁
    refine trStmts₁_supports' (trNormal_supports H₂) H₁ fun h => ?_
    refine supports_union.2 ⟨codeSupp'_supports H₂, ?_⟩
    simp only [codeSupp, contSupp_cons₂, Finset.union_subset_iff] at H₂
    exact trStmts₁_supports' (head_supports H₂.2.2) (Finset.union_subset_right h) IH
  | cons₂ k IH =>
    have H' := H; rw [contSupp_cons₂] at H'
    exact trStmts₁_supports' (head_supports <| Finset.union_subset_right H') H' IH
  | comp f k IH =>
    have H' := H; rw [contSupp_comp] at H'; have H₂ := Finset.union_subset_right H'
    exact supports_union.2 ⟨codeSupp'_supports H', IH H₂⟩
  | fix f k IH =>
    rw [contSupp] at H
    exact supports_union.2 ⟨codeSupp'_supports H, IH (Finset.union_subset_right H)⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/ToPartrec/Variant655379450e4ba1c90e2f24e4b1f72a8e4f9b7e5f95458f513c12035e46a08012.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Computability/ToPartrec/Variant655379450e4ba1c90e2f24e4b1f72a8e4f9b7e5f95458f513c12035e46a08012.lean#L1256).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c99705ed18c92e83219c09ab347bf368539512b5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
