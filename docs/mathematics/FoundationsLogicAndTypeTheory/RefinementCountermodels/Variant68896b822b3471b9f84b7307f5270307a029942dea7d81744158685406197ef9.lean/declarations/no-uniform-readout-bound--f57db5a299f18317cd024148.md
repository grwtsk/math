## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dd812d6b-f705-729d-5cc2-0c6f021af7af`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 22–31.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem no_uniform_readout_bound :
    ¬ ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ A : ℝ, 1 ≤ A → A ≤ C := by
  rintro ⟨C, hC⟩
  have h := hC (max 1 (C + 1)) (le_max_left _ _)
  have hg : C < max 1 (C + 1) :=
    lt_of_lt_of_le (lt_add_one C) (le_max_right _ _)
  exact (not_le_of_gt hg) h

/-- Every cycle of this two-edge fixture has total cost zero, while its first
edge can have arbitrary positive cost. The complete endpoint budget matters. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/RefinementCountermodels/Variant68896b822b3471b9f84b7307f5270307a029942dea7d81744158685406197ef9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/RefinementCountermodels/Variant68896b822b3471b9f84b7307f5270307a029942dea7d81744158685406197ef9.lean#L22).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0d5cac1e2b626126931cc4d9f3293d10a450fc83` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
