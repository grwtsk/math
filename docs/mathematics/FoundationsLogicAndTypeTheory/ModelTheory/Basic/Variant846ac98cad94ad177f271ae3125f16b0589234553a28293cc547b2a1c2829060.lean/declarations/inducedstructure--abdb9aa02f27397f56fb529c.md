## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8e531a3af09b77ba06da43ace9826b0163dc783e970f2abdf1957663382c5032`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1031–1037.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def inducedStructure (e : M ≃ N) : L.Structure N :=
  ⟨fun f x => e (funMap f (e.symm ∘ x)), fun r x => RelMap r (e.symm ∘ x)⟩
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false in
#align equiv.induced_Structure Equiv.inducedStructure

/-- A bijection as a first-order isomorphism with the induced structure on the codomain. -/
--@[simps!] Porting note: commented out and lemmas added manually
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/Basic/Variant846ac98cad94ad177f271ae3125f16b0589234553a28293cc547b2a1c2829060.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/Basic/Variant846ac98cad94ad177f271ae3125f16b0589234553a28293cc547b2a1c2829060.lean#L1031).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4be20cb0c2137de86143073205b4ec67bbfac76a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
