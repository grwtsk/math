## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0e1208ab6127a15c392912460719d05612559cdcb5faf1bef41aa4e2c75e611d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–163.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def SnapshotTask.bindIO (t : SnapshotTask α) (act : α → BaseIO (SnapshotTask β))
    (stx? : Option Syntax := t.stx?) (reportingRange : SnapshotTask.ReportingRange := t.reportingRange)
    (cancelTk? : Option IO.CancelToken) (sync := false) : BaseIO (SnapshotTask β) := do
  return {
    stx?, reportingRange, cancelTk?
    task := (← BaseIO.bindTask (sync := sync) t.task fun a => (·.task) <$> (act a))
  }

/-- Synchronously waits on the result of the task. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/Basic/Varianta6aca4bca50ae1477eeab77696a199c029ae41a8d178fc86dc5d83767dea3236.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/Basic/Varianta6aca4bca50ae1477eeab77696a199c029ae41a8d178fc86dc5d83767dea3236.lean#L155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4a579f0cb536096f0815bd245a64a8151f01937f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
