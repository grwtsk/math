## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:307f134c-2a53-d577-eb9a-05d8bd96f0ab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 208–227.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem realize_one (v : α → R) : Term.realize v (1 : ring.Term α) = 1 := by
  simp [one_def, funMap_one, constantMap]

end

/-- Given a Type `R` with instances for each of the `Ring` operations, make a
`Language.ring.Structure R` instance, along with a proof that the operations given
by the `Language.ring.Structure` are the same as those given by the `Add` or `Mul` etc.
instances.

This definition can be used when applying a theorem about the model theory of rings
to a literal ring `R`, by writing `let _ := compatibleRingOfRing R`. After this, if,
for example, `R` is a field, then Lean will be able to find the instance for
`Theory.field.Model R`, and it will be possible to apply theorems about the model theory
of fields.

This is a `def` and not an `instance`, because the path
`Ring` => `Language.ring.Structure` => `Ring` cannot be made to
commute by definition
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/Basic/Variantac86844914514a243247e77c468ba3a456af31fdaba712f4f7a80a2157b52761.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/Basic/Variantac86844914514a243247e77c468ba3a456af31fdaba712f4f7a80a2157b52761.lean#L208).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `28aef1785af70890fc4525c397b103f9aa985669` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
