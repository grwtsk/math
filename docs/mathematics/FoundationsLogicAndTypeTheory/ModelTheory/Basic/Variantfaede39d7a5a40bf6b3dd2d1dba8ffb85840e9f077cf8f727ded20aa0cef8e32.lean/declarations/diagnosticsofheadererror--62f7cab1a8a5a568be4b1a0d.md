## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bac4b71cb2d0c8b5e60fe2d36386a0fe747a7615755da9dbac886df36f98830e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 493–504.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def diagnosticsOfHeaderError (msg : String) : ProcessingM Snapshot.Diagnostics := do
  let msgLog := MessageLog.empty.add {
    fileName := "<input>"
    pos := ⟨1, 0⟩
    endPos := (← read).fileMap.toPosition (← read).fileMap.source.rawEndPos
    data := msg
  }
  Snapshot.Diagnostics.ofMessageLog msgLog

/--
  Adds unexpected exceptions from header processing to the message log as a last resort; standard
  errors should already have been caught earlier. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/Basic/Variantfaede39d7a5a40bf6b3dd2d1dba8ffb85840e9f077cf8f727ded20aa0cef8e32.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/Basic/Variantfaede39d7a5a40bf6b3dd2d1dba8ffb85840e9f077cf8f727ded20aa0cef8e32.lean#L493).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `967353485bde06c32d806ac028d93b654053fc8d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
