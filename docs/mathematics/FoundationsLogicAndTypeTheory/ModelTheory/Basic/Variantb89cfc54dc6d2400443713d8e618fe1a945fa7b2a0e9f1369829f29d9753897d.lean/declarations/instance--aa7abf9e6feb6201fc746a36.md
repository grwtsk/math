## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a52d124b7c2e6de1fd39329cad6221e97448ed4f6926d3c93f888a448301270c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–164.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [Field K] [CompatibleRing K] : Theory.field.Model K :=
  { realize_of_mem := by
      simp only [Theory.field, Set.mem_range, exists_imp]
      rintro φ a rfl
      rw [a.realize_toSentence_iff_toProp (K := K)]
      cases a with
      | existsPairNE => exact exists_pair_ne K
      | existsInv => exact fun x hx0 => ⟨x⁻¹, mul_inv_cancel₀ hx0⟩
      | addAssoc => exact add_assoc
      | zeroAdd => exact zero_add
      | negAddCancel => exact neg_add_cancel
      | mulAssoc => exact mul_assoc
      | mulComm => exact mul_comm
      | oneMul => exact one_mul
      | leftDistrib => exact mul_add }

end Field

end FirstOrder
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/Basic/Variantb89cfc54dc6d2400443713d8e618fe1a945fa7b2a0e9f1369829f29d9753897d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/Basic/Variantb89cfc54dc6d2400443713d8e618fe1a945fa7b2a0e9f1369829f29d9753897d.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5fc371125e17f87a73b61f69570dc6bf475a6567` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
