## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4feb3b5698cf774f653d0df7cbed0092c687cce8f49341228e4abfebf571c5f2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 355–364.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure WorkerState where
  doc                : EditableDocument
  /-- Token flagged for aborting `doc.reporter` when a new document version comes in. -/
  reporterCancelTk   : CancelToken
  importCachingTask? : Option (ServerTask (Except Error AvailableImportsCache))
  pendingRequests    : PendingRequestMap
  /-- A map of RPC session IDs. We allow asynchronous elab tasks and request handlers
  to modify sessions. A single `Ref` ensures atomic transactions. -/
  rpcSessions        : Std.TreeMap UInt64 (IO.Ref RpcSession)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/FileWorker/Variantc938b3b122afda96dd4f2a73a39425e60d71845780b6f6d2d3a8a554b2ea3623.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/FileWorker/Variantc938b3b122afda96dd4f2a73a39425e60d71845780b6f6d2d3a8a554b2ea3623.lean#L355).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cf8058ac800a67394e26aa4752539ddd979877c1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
