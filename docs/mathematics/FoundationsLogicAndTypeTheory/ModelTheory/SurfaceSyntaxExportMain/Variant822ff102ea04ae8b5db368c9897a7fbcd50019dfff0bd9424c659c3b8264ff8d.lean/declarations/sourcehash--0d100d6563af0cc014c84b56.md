## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5442ece3885c1086586b70b70255d0d6ff6951e7b7be27ce144d1f5bd24b51b6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 381–390.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def sourceHash (path : System.FilePath) : IO String := do
  let output ← IO.Process.output {
    cmd := "/usr/bin/shasum"
    args := #["-a", "256", path.toString] }
  if output.exitCode != 0 then
    throw <| IO.userError "shasum failed while hashing exact source bytes"
  let digest := (output.stdout.splitOn " ").head?.getD ""
  if validLowerHash digest then pure digest
  else throw <| IO.userError "shasum returned a noncanonical SHA-256 digest"

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/SurfaceSyntaxExportMain/Variant822ff102ea04ae8b5db368c9897a7fbcd50019dfff0bd9424c659c3b8264ff8d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/SurfaceSyntaxExportMain/Variant822ff102ea04ae8b5db368c9897a7fbcd50019dfff0bd9424c659c3b8264ff8d.lean#L381).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c99c00d233ae94a7be533a121998039832a190a2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
