## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2ce8902fec958fab3d5666856c08e581e46ecd08cf02d397dc57dbe4a367b33d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 583–603.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
unsafe def main (args : List String) : IO UInt32 := do
  if (← IO.getEnv workerEnvironmentKey) == some "1" then
    SurfaceSyntaxExport.main args
  else
    -- A native Lake executable does not carry the same live elaborator
    -- environment as the Lean command-line frontend. Re-enter this exact Lean
    -- source through `lean --run`, with inherited stdout/stderr, so canonical
    -- command snapshots come from the real frontend rather than a weakened
    -- handwritten parser. The finite process bounds fail closed.
    let lake := (← IO.getEnv "LAKE").getD "lake"
    let workerArgs :=
      #["env", "lean", "--memory=8192", "--timeout=8000000", "--threads=1", "--run",
        "tools/SurfaceSyntaxExportMain.lean"] ++ args.toArray
    let child ← IO.Process.spawn {
      cmd := lake
      args := workerArgs
      stdin := .null
      stdout := .inherit
      stderr := .inherit
      env := #[(workerEnvironmentKey, some "1")] }
    child.wait
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/SurfaceSyntaxExportMain/Variant78e7fb43e2514d5aa821d7f8a0c9cacac878b944c8cfa60108f8c124fa54f9cd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/SurfaceSyntaxExportMain/Variant78e7fb43e2514d5aa821d7f8a0c9cacac878b944c8cfa60108f8c124fa54f9cd.lean#L583).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `81f1d420901e10096cb98343f083590d1f765a30` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
