## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:48da0ffd5735b570301c5893298afa95c58ddf7d1f686eefe0612bf226f5018b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 68–75.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive Rewrites (r : ContextFreeRule T N) : List (Symbol T N) → List (Symbol T N) → Prop
  /-- The replacement is at the start of the remaining string. -/
  | head (s : List (Symbol T N)) :
      r.Rewrites (Symbol.nonterminal r.input :: s) (r.output ++ s)
  /-- There is a replacement later in the string. -/
  | cons (x : Symbol T N) {s₁ s₂ : List (Symbol T N)} (hrs : Rewrites r s₁ s₂) :
      r.Rewrites (x :: s₁) (x :: s₂)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/ContextFreeGrammar/Variant6c87975050d6855e1f68ad989b72188a1845a1c0faeed1dbd07d3cfd84e62d45.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/ContextFreeGrammar/Variant6c87975050d6855e1f68ad989b72188a1845a1c0faeed1dbd07d3cfd84e62d45.lean#L68).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `827ebbb826dd1681d864061e0718342b1424589a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
