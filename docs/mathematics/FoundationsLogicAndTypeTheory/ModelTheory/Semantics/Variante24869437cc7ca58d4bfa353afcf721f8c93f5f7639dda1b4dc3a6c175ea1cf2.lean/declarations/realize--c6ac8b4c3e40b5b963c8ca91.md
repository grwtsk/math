## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:874eb7d433f0fdccc4c70812a256382dcab797c44403a0b889b0202ab94384a5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 238–248.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Realize : ∀ {l} (_f : L.BoundedFormula α l) (_v : α → M) (_xs : Fin l → M), Prop
  | _, falsum, _v, _xs => False
  | _, equal t₁ t₂, v, xs => t₁.realize (Sum.elim v xs) = t₂.realize (Sum.elim v xs)
  | _, rel R ts, v, xs => RelMap R fun i => (ts i).realize (Sum.elim v xs)
  | _, imp f₁ f₂, v, xs => Realize f₁ v xs → Realize f₂ v xs
  | _, all f, v, xs => ∀ x : M, Realize f v (snoc xs x)

variable {l : ℕ} {φ ψ : L.BoundedFormula α l} {θ : L.BoundedFormula α l.succ}
variable {v : α → M} {xs : Fin l → M}

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/Semantics/Variante24869437cc7ca58d4bfa353afcf721f8c93f5f7639dda1b4dc3a6c175ea1cf2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/ModelTheory/Semantics/Variante24869437cc7ca58d4bfa353afcf721f8c93f5f7639dda1b4dc3a6c175ea1cf2.lean#L238).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f10ffb2e1c1d22091a9704a3dc76c587fa63986c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
