## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c096825f3d98163a7d91604b9d97a9ac00c43f8ac555a9a2275c93451f02c5b0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 198–206.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def bitLength (m : Int) : Nat := natBitLength m.natAbs

/-- Normalize a Dyadic to keep the mantissa within a reasonable bit-limit.

This prevents mantissas from growing without bound during repeated multiplications.
Similar to how hardware floats work, but with directed rounding.

- `maxBits`: Maximum allowed bits for mantissa (default 256)
- `roundUp`: If true, round toward +∞; if false, round toward -∞ -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Dyadic/Variantdaac7a49a7783ab06068f69999beb20c3e4bb3b863dea2d4647e46cd67b07dbe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/Dyadic/Variantdaac7a49a7783ab06068f69999beb20c3e4bb3b863dea2d4647e46cd67b07dbe.lean#L198).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8155d886cc441e2f488dc02954233f9c0e659c04` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
