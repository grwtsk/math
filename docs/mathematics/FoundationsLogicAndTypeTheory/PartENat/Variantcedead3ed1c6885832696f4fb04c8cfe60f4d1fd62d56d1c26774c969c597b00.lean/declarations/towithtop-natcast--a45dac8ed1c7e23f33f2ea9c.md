## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:27359b37-1eb7-f575-bb92-ea86b8af2de8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 589–604.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
theorem toWithTop_natCast' (n : ℕ) {h : Decidable (n : PartENat).Dom} :
    toWithTop (n : PartENat) = n := by
  rw [toWithTop_natCast n]
#align part_enat.to_with_top_coe' PartENat.toWithTop_natCast'

-- Porting note: statement changed. Mathlib 3 statement was
-- ```
-- @[simp] lemma to_with_top_le {x y : part_enat} :
--   Π [decidable x.dom] [decidable y.dom], by exactI to_with_top x ≤ to_with_top y ↔ x ≤ y :=
-- ```
-- This used to be really slow to typecheck when the definition of `ENat`
-- was still `deriving AddCommMonoidWithOne`. Now that I removed that it is fine.
-- (The problem was that the last `simp` got stuck at `CharZero ℕ∞ ≟ CharZero ℕ∞` where
-- one side used `instENatAddCommMonoidWithOne` and the other used
-- `NonAssocSemiring.toAddCommMonoidWithOne`. Now the former doesn't exist anymore.)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/PartENat/Variantcedead3ed1c6885832696f4fb04c8cfe60f4d1fd62d56d1c26774c969c597b00.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/FoundationsLogicAndTypeTheory/PartENat/Variantcedead3ed1c6885832696f4fb04c8cfe60f4d1fd62d56d1c26774c969c597b00.lean#L589).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c6130a8b5b1c962dcaf3d83b20eabeba2045a1eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
