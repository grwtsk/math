## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8e00ea300cfeeaa3fdab7f7be6163eab6c2513ccc4afbd57072580bd6c952612`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 217–246.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ProjectiveLineCubicIntersectionData
    (C : LawfulShortWeierstrass.{u})
    (P : ProjectiveWeierstrassClosureCertificate C) where
  Line : Type u
  lineContains :
    Line → P.projectiveModel.ProjectivePoint → Prop
  lineThrough :
    Point C.E → Point C.E → Line → Prop
  tangentAt :
    Point C.E → Line → Prop
  IntersectionPoint : Type u

  intersection_on_line :
    ∀ X : IntersectionPoint,
      lineContains (intersectionLine X) (toProjectivePoint X)

    ∀ X : IntersectionPoint,
      P.projectiveModel.projectiveEquation (toProjectivePoint X)
  boundary : List String

/--
Typed Bezout/multiplicity data for line/cubic intersections.

This is supplied theorem-facing data. It does not prove Bezout or define
scheme-theoretic multiplicity from first principles; it prevents those inputs
from being represented by bare descriptor gates.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/DifferentialEquationsAndDynamicalSystems/GroupLaw/Varianta6379b559a91ddf1bc47911d6b5da857a2554f4838ac828da1c938c4e2e85c89.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/DifferentialEquationsAndDynamicalSystems/GroupLaw/Varianta6379b559a91ddf1bc47911d6b5da857a2554f4838ac828da1c938c4e2e85c89.lean#L217).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `761140093e66cc83e6c64f13f018ada1046a2f3d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
