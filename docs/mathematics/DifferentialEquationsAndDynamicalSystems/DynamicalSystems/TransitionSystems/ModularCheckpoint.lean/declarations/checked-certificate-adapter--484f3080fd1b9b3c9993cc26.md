## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:16dac687-c267-56c5-2d64-64d42e50ccbd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 254–267.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem checked_certificate_adapter {p : ℕ} (cert : PartialSumOrdering.OrderingCertificate p)
    (currentSource currentEpoch : ℕ) (phaseOrigin : ZMod p)
    (checked : PartialSumOrdering.checkCertificate cert = true)
    (sourceMatch : cert.sourceRevision = currentSource) (epochMatch : cert.epoch = currentEpoch) :
    BindingCurrent (certificateBinding cert) currentSource currentEpoch ∧
      cert.finalOrder.Perm cert.originalOrder ∧
      (postPhases phaseOrigin id cert.finalOrder).Nodup := by
  have sound := PartialSumOrdering.checkCertificate_sound cert checked
  refine ⟨⟨sourceMatch, epochMatch⟩, sound.2.1, ?_⟩
  apply certified_postPhases_nodup
  simpa using sound.1

/-- Injective phase labels transport the checked label permutation back to the
original work identities. Costs remain a separate function on those identities. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/DifferentialEquationsAndDynamicalSystems/DynamicalSystems/TransitionSystems/ModularCheckpoint.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/DynamicalSystems/TransitionSystems/ModularCheckpoint.lean#L254).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `865bc64a18d69d2cf4325229ea08e0931dd0e1a8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
