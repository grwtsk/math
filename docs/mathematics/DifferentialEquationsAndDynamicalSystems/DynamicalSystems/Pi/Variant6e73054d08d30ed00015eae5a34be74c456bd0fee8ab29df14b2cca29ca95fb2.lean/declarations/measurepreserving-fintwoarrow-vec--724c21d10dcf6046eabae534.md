## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:26be8f73-ad1a-3acc-1a54-54f71f64ad82`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 811–817.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measurePreserving_finTwoArrow_vec {α : Type u} {m : MeasurableSpace α} (μ ν : Measure α)
    [SigmaFinite μ] [SigmaFinite ν] :
    MeasurePreserving MeasurableEquiv.finTwoArrow (Measure.pi ![μ, ν]) (μ.prod ν) :=
  haveI : ∀ i, SigmaFinite (![μ, ν] i) := Fin.forall_fin_two.2 ⟨‹_›, ‹_›⟩

#align measure_theory.measure_preserving_fin_two_arrow_vec MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_finTwoArrow_vec

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/DifferentialEquationsAndDynamicalSystems/DynamicalSystems/Pi/Variant6e73054d08d30ed00015eae5a34be74c456bd0fee8ab29df14b2cca29ca95fb2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/DifferentialEquationsAndDynamicalSystems/DynamicalSystems/Pi/Variant6e73054d08d30ed00015eae5a34be74c456bd0fee8ab29df14b2cca29ca95fb2.lean#L811).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4e5a2b6aaad20f340b204f870463f99ddd6330e6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
