## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:83d2adf925171a220ae60ec78a9cd2d02058e54e65d14e45b58a63e954148e98`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 625–629.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {G : ι → Type*} [∀ i, Group (G i)] [∀ i, MeasureSpace (G i)] [∀ i, MeasurableInv (G i)]
    [∀ i, SigmaFinite (volume : Measure (G i))] [∀ i, IsInvInvariant (volume : Measure (G i))] :
    IsInvInvariant (volume : Measure (∀ i, G i)) :=
  pi.isInvInvariant _

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/DifferentialEquationsAndDynamicalSystems/DynamicalSystems/Pi/Variant6e73054d08d30ed00015eae5a34be74c456bd0fee8ab29df14b2cca29ca95fb2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/DifferentialEquationsAndDynamicalSystems/DynamicalSystems/Pi/Variant6e73054d08d30ed00015eae5a34be74c456bd0fee8ab29df14b2cca29ca95fb2.lean#L625).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4e5a2b6aaad20f340b204f870463f99ddd6330e6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
