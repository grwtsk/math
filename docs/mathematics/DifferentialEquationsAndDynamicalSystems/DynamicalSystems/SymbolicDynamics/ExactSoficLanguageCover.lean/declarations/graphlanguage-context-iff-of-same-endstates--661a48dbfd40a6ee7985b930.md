## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:df9b41b7-2242-f10e-6d86-c6652ba62787`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 238–250.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem graphLanguage_context_iff_of_same_endStates
    {State : Type u} {Alphabet : Type v} [Fintype State]
    (G : LabeledGraph State Alphabet) (left right suffix : List Alphabet)
    (h : reachableEndStates G left = reachableEndStates G right) :
    GraphLanguage G (left ++ suffix) ↔
      GraphLanguage G (right ++ suffix) := by
  rw [graphLanguage_append_iff_endStates G left suffix,
    graphLanguage_append_iff_endStates G right suffix, h]

/-- A language has arbitrarily many distinct right contexts if every
number of words can be distinguished pairwise by SOME continuation.
This is a strong, testable anti-finite-state premise, not a declaration
that a particular arithmetic trace already has this property. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/DifferentialEquationsAndDynamicalSystems/DynamicalSystems/SymbolicDynamics/ExactSoficLanguageCover.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/DynamicalSystems/Symbolic/ExactSoficLanguageCover.lean#L238).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7233696059a408af98af15fec0e34c02f7afb657` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
