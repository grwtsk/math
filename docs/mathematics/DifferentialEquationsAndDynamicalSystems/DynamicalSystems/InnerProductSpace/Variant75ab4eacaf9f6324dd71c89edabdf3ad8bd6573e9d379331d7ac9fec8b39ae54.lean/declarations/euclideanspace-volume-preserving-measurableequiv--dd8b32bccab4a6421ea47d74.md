## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b73b06f4-5be1-cdd5-d56a-1e73ec1a2310`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 131–140.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem EuclideanSpace.volume_preserving_measurableEquiv :
    MeasurePreserving (EuclideanSpace.measurableEquiv ι) := by
  suffices volume = map (EuclideanSpace.measurableEquiv ι).symm volume by
    convert ((EuclideanSpace.measurableEquiv ι).symm.measurable.measurePreserving _).symm

  exact (EuclideanSpace.basisFun _ _).addHaar_eq_volume.symm

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/DifferentialEquationsAndDynamicalSystems/DynamicalSystems/InnerProductSpace/Variant75ab4eacaf9f6324dd71c89edabdf3ad8bd6573e9d379331d7ac9fec8b39ae54.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/DifferentialEquationsAndDynamicalSystems/DynamicalSystems/InnerProductSpace/Variant75ab4eacaf9f6324dd71c89edabdf3ad8bd6573e9d379331d7ac9fec8b39ae54.lean#L131).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `66230d46bd9b33503d173121651457cd59c87137` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
