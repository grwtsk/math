## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b86c8134-854e-35c5-c3da-e3bfc612a3a1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    {target : Object → Result} {lower : WithTop ℕ}
    (bound : ∀ selected ⊆ admitted, SeparatesTarget obs selected target →

  apply Finset.le_min
  intro size member
  obtain ⟨selected, hselected, rfl⟩ := Finset.mem_image.mp member
  obtain ⟨subset, separates⟩ := (mem_sufficientObservationFamilies obs _ _ target).mp hselected
  exact bound selected subset separates

/-- Every sufficient admitted family bounds the minimum declared cost. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/MinimumObservation/Variant67c5f9d4983aa5c76ceb9b9ef3f2d9bc3a67d38661520c0ae11bb8814e406aac.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/MinimumObservation/Variant67c5f9d4983aa5c76ceb9b9ef3f2d9bc3a67d38661520c0ae11bb8814e406aac.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `04af1a5916d6095463ee9aeb7ba81d14ef632ce6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
