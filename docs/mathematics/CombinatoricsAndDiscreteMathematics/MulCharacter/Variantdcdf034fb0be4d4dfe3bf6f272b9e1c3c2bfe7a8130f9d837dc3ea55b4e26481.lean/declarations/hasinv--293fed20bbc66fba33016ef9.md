## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f713cefd11e2d11cb0273c322b4107fe7b4640d42b9c1e6f9f91b48a380afd23`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 319–323.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance hasInv : Inv (MulChar R R') :=
  ⟨inv⟩
#align mul_char.has_inv MulChar.hasInv

/-- The inverse of a multiplicative character `χ`, applied to `a`, is the inverse of `χ a`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/MulCharacter/Variantdcdf034fb0be4d4dfe3bf6f272b9e1c3c2bfe7a8130f9d837dc3ea55b4e26481.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/MulCharacter/Variantdcdf034fb0be4d4dfe3bf6f272b9e1c3c2bfe7a8130f9d837dc3ea55b4e26481.lean#L319).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `44c24736cb73bfb179e93247f6f130dd15bf26ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
