## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:398d20b8ea171a2d52d0fe9bbdb3a441ca34eaafe6bc4def873fa6e2c687404d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 145–152.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def take (i : ℕ) (hi : (p.toList.take i).count U = (p.toList.take i).count D) : DyckWord where
  toList := p.toList.take i
  count_U_eq_count_D := hi
  count_D_le_count_U k := by rw [take_take]; exact p.count_D_le_count_U (min k i)

variable (p) in
/-- Suffix of a Dyck word as a Dyck word, given that the count of `U`s and `D`s in the prefix
are equal. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/EnumerativeCombinatorics/DyckWord/Variantae08fd45b8bfe646adab14c36d7a2d1e10569c13a1b268c4e1bf60a4e3f08b2b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/EnumerativeCombinatorics/DyckWord/Variantae08fd45b8bfe646adab14c36d7a2d1e10569c13a1b268c4e1bf60a4e3f08b2b.lean#L145).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ab1681b522b333865243d333276793972141df09` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
