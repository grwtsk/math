## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1bc8648c-728b-05df-a2cf-d83348c0ab76`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 283–299.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/--
Stirling's approximation gives a lower bound for `log n!` for all positive `n`.
The left-hand side is formulated in decreasing order in `n`: the higher order terms are first.
This is a consequence of `le_factorial_stirling`, but is stated separately since the logarithmic
version is sometimes more practical, and having this version eases algebraic calculations for
applications.
See also `log_stirlingSeq_sdiff_le` for Robbins' sharp bound of `1/(12k(k+1))` on successive
differences in the Stirling sequence, which provides finer control over the convergence rate.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/EnumerativeCombinatorics/Stirling/Variant2f914b4c3c04d6c2dff3cd25c14812d6fb6fd056ddbcdc7e41065ed460e28125.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/EnumerativeCombinatorics/Stirling/Variant2f914b4c3c04d6c2dff3cd25c14812d6fb6fd056ddbcdc7e41065ed460e28125.lean#L283).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `20cf8e9dc074acb4d60f49ef10d660b3ffd9c459` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
