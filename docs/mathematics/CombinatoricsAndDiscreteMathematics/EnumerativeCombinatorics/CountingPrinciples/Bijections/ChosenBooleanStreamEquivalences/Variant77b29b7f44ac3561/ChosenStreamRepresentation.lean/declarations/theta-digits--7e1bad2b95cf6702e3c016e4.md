## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f941c437-4700-ad3c-4a13-6c3dc7c837c6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 82–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem theta_digits
    (representation : DesignatedCantorRepresentation)
    (scalar : representation.Scalar) :
    representation.theta (representation.digits scalar) = scalar :=
  representation.theta.apply_symm_apply scalar

end DesignatedCantorRepresentation

/--
The designated scalar represented by the all-false digit stream.  This is a
representation-relative distinguished point; it does not assert that the
carrier scalar type has an independently chosen additive zero.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/EnumerativeCombinatorics/CountingPrinciples/Bijections/ChosenBooleanStreamEquivalences/Variant77b29b7f44ac3561/ChosenStreamRepresentation.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/EnumerativeCombinatorics/CountingPrinciples/Bijections/ChosenBooleanStreamEquivalences/Variant77b29b7f44ac3561/ChosenStreamRepresentation.lean#L82).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `29da9c91fe6ea5fcc05e70a33e53024b448fd098` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
