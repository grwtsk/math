## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:91551bdc-2eed-e4d8-03af-63e17d42e118`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 244–251.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma parts_top_subset : ((⊤ : Partition s) : Set α) ⊆ {s} := by simp

/-- When `α` is a frame, the meet `P ⊓ Q` of two partitions is the partition consisting of all
non-bottom meets `p ⊓ q` for `p ∈ P` and `q ∈ Q`.

Note that while finite meets of partitions can be constructed in this way, arbitrary meets generally
do not exist: for example when `α` is the frame of open subsets of the Cantor space, `Partition α`
has no bottom element. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/EnumerativeCombinatorics/Basic/Variant4a2a2305ee6bdd7ae0502f56dbea0b64e0fa89cfc2c5c779758bb9ce72f4b5ac.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/EnumerativeCombinatorics/Basic/Variant4a2a2305ee6bdd7ae0502f56dbea0b64e0fa89cfc2c5c779758bb9ce72f4b5ac.lean#L244).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f8006ac214189d24392163d1cc519bef90e5b71f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
