## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:afe911bb-ca40-09e1-e494-0fba9ab116ff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 133–149.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private lemma paired_injective (hf : Injective f) : Injective (paired f) := by
  apply Injective.of_lt_imp_ne
  intro i j hij q
  cases lt_or_gt_of_ne (hf.ne hij.ne)
  case inl h => exact (maxIncSequencesTo_lt hij h).ne congr($q.1)
  case inr h => exact (maxDecSequencesTo_gt hij h).ne congr($q.2)

/-- **Erdős–Szekeres Theorem**: Given a sequence of more than `r * s` distinct values, there is an
increasing sequence of length longer than `r` or a decreasing sequence of length longer than `s`.

Proof idea:
We label each value in the sequence with two numbers specifying the longest increasing
subsequence ending there, and the longest decreasing subsequence ending there.
We then show the pair of labels must be unique. Now if there is no increasing sequence longer than
`r` and no decreasing sequence longer than `s`, then there are at most `r * s` possible labels,
which is a contradiction if there are more than `r * s` elements.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/AscendingDescendingSequences/Variant0c94cc305fce0e13b306f14df78a15d699bf62f6c189ece158870bc4f177d30d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/AscendingDescendingSequences/Variant0c94cc305fce0e13b306f14df78a15d699bf62f6c189ece158870bc4f177d30d.lean#L133).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9cb8c825d1304c0b34c2de23fc5395ed9a0a69fc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
