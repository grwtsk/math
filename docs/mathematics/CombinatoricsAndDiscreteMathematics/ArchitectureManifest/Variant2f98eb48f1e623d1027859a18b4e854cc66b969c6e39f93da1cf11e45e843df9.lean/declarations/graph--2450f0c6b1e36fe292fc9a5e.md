## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:acc8da00d14946c73cdc2805ffc88280cc50ebe10780fda01fc74efb371e756f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–166.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def graph : DAF.DependencyGraph :=
  DAF.DependencyGraph.ofRank ProjectId directDependencies rank (by
    intro dependency project h
    cases project <;> cases dependency <;>
      simp_all [directDependencies, rank])

/--
Logical interface owner for each project.  When several fine-grained modules
intentionally publish declarations in one parent namespace (for example
`DAF.Comparison`), this value is the unique owning module name used by the
manifest, not a claim that Lean declarations were discovered by prefix scan.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/ArchitectureManifest/Variant2f98eb48f1e623d1027859a18b4e854cc66b969c6e39f93da1cf11e45e843df9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/ArchitectureManifest/Variant2f98eb48f1e623d1027859a18b4e854cc66b969c6e39f93da1cf11e45e843df9.lean#L155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fcd7aafe7ad20f2ed6855255c78997746eb4ed93` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
