## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:50169b5f2a17f7c664cf72c8eb8710e33475ac4a57eeeef58bdcbbbfb0121d9a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 72–86.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isCentralScalar [SMul α β] [SMul αᵐᵒᵖ β] [IsCentralScalar α β] :
    IsCentralScalar α (Finset β) :=
  ⟨fun a s => coe_injective <| by simp only [coe_smul_finset, coe_smul, op_smul_eq_smul]⟩

#adaptation_note /-- nightly-2025-04-07
This now needs to be marked as noncomputable because of its dependence on `Set.monoid`.
We should either find a way to rewrite this definition to avoid this,
or request via @kim-em and @zwarich that changes in https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/7824
be revisited to avoid needing as many `noncomputable`s.

/-- A multiplicative action of a monoid `α` on a type `β` gives a multiplicative action of
`Finset α` on `Finset β`. -/

      "An additive action of an additive monoid `α` on a type `β` gives an additive action
      of `Finset α` on `Finset β`"]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Finset/Variant3c1dba4e6254b4f71ed6e26cd45df3f795a54952fbe9031d8c032244ab7196c9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Finset/Variant3c1dba4e6254b4f71ed6e26cd45df3f795a54952fbe9031d8c032244ab7196c9.lean#L72).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `58698243360ed4a7d69f66845fee63a6db6a304a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
