## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a10a39c3675714333b9bffd1a8b859e4d6b5569bf7e5cd230fdd2eca5ffba519`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 231–239.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instNonAssocSemiring [Preorder α] [LocallyFiniteOrder α] [DecidableEq α]
    [NonAssocSemiring 𝕜] : NonAssocSemiring (IncidenceAlgebra 𝕜 α) where
  __ := instNonUnitalNonAssocSemiring
  mul := (· * ·)
  zero := 0
  one := 1
  one_mul := fun f ↦ by ext; simp [*]
  mul_one := fun f ↦ by ext; simp [*]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/IncidenceAlgebra/Variante88f7785a660a05cfb01b64febaa80b74684c12308e3ea7bac4530544a9f81b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/IncidenceAlgebra/Variante88f7785a660a05cfb01b64febaa80b74684c12308e3ea7bac4530544a9f81b9.lean#L231).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2b97cd4b822ad2646325971198a8dd7891c63a8d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
