## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3ae4b25c-f541-0c47-f8c1-c74fb04c629e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–112.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isCircuit_iff_forall_ssubset : M.IsCircuit C ↔ M.Dep C ∧ ∀ ⦃I⦄, I ⊂ C → M.Indep I := by
  rw [IsCircuit, minimal_iff_forall_ssubset, and_congr_right_iff]
  exact fun h ↦ ⟨fun h' I hIC ↦ ((not_dep_iff (hIC.subset.trans h.subset_ground)).1 (h' hIC)),
    fun h I hIC ↦ (h hIC).not_dep⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/ExtremalCombinatorics/Circuit/Variantce9f8f009711dc16a7d60bc5430800733709d2c7e55a939b5bc0e1fffb8306fb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/ExtremalCombinatorics/Circuit/Variantce9f8f009711dc16a7d60bc5430800733709d2c7e55a939b5bc0e1fffb8306fb.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d3901a8675ad7f7c3c93f4af2b41779145649b03` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
