## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2b1af9fa-f5dd-c7d8-e11b-ffcf3d00e823`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 191–203.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-! ### Fundamental IsCircuits -/

/-- For an independent set `I` and some `e ∈ M.closure I \ I`,
`M.fundCircuit e I` is the unique circuit contained in `insert e I`.
For the fact that this is a circuit, see `Matroid.Indep.fundCircuit_isCircuit`,
and the fact that it is unique, see `Matroid.IsCircuit.eq_fundCircuit_of_subset`.
Has the junk value `{e}` if `e ∈ I` or `e ∉ M.E`, and `insert e I` if `e ∈ M.E \ M.closure I`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/ExtremalCombinatorics/Circuit/Variantce9f8f009711dc16a7d60bc5430800733709d2c7e55a939b5bc0e1fffb8306fb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/ExtremalCombinatorics/Circuit/Variantce9f8f009711dc16a7d60bc5430800733709d2c7e55a939b5bc0e1fffb8306fb.lean#L191).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d3901a8675ad7f7c3c93f4af2b41779145649b03` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
