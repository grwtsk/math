## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:978f53ae-7c06-b5b6-19b5-834e1aebc2b3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 83–88.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem proj_equiv₁' (f : Fin n → α) : graph.proj ∘ graphEquiv₁ f = f :=
  rfl
#align tuple.proj_equiv₁' Tuple.proj_equiv₁'

/-- `graphEquiv₂ f` is an equivalence between `Fin n` and `graph f` that respects the order.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Sort/Variant28af74fb110b860ff4796163ddc9a8b9cd42102d9a5689b88c297a72dffe426d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Sort/Variant28af74fb110b860ff4796163ddc9a8b9cd42102d9a5689b88c297a72dffe426d.lean#L83).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7becda2d05824a3473757cabe5ab33f53cd1b611` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
