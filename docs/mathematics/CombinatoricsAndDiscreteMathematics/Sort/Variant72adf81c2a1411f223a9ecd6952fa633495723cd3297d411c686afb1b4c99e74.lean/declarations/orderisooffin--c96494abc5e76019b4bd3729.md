## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f61be79243c440150eff473b51463d1a0a95cedcc947b3b804559231b3e8a384`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–154.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def orderIsoOfFin (s : Finset α) {k : ℕ} (h : s.card = k) : Fin k ≃o s :=
  OrderIso.trans (Fin.castIso ((length_sort (α := α) (· ≤ ·)).trans h).symm) <|
    (s.sort_sorted_lt.getIso _).trans <| OrderIso.setCongr _ _ <| Set.ext fun _ => mem_sort _
#align finset.order_iso_of_fin Finset.orderIsoOfFin

/-- Given a finset `s` of cardinality `k` in a linear order `α`, the map `orderEmbOfFin s h` is
the increasing bijection between `Fin k` and `s` as an order embedding into `α`. Here, `h` is a
proof that the cardinality of `s` is `k`. We use this instead of an embedding `Fin s.card ↪o α` to
avoid casting issues in further uses of this function. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Sort/Variant72adf81c2a1411f223a9ecd6952fa633495723cd3297d411c686afb1b4c99e74.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Sort/Variant72adf81c2a1411f223a9ecd6952fa633495723cd3297d411c686afb1b4c99e74.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `89c10048c98afc5c53c3006a223c5ef3cc6f1d28` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
