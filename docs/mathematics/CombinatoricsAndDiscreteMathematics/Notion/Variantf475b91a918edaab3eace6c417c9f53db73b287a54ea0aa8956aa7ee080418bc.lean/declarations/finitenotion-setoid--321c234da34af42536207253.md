## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:847e87c8208b5f1606d707ec04878c99a87afc977da76a5060b8f5668c3d8138`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 69–75.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def FiniteNotion.setoid {Object Test Value : Type*}
    (notion : FiniteNotion Object Test Value) (budget : ℕ) : Setoid Object where
  r := notion.Equivalent budget
  iseqv := ⟨fun _ _ _ _ => rfl, fun h t hm hc => (h t hm hc).symm,
    fun hxy hyz t hm hc => (hxy t hm hc).trans (hyz t hm hc)⟩

/-- Exact executable comparison, restricted to the declared finite test family. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Notion/Variantf475b91a918edaab3eace6c417c9f53db73b287a54ea0aa8956aa7ee080418bc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Notion/Variantf475b91a918edaab3eace6c417c9f53db73b287a54ea0aa8956aa7ee080418bc.lean#L69).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8ed057a81bba02fe113fc9ed044d48ed13876bc0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
