## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:05e25d36-a3ec-bde7-b397-8834fc7aa0db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 204–215.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem external_only_assessment_cannot_exclude
    (theoremAdapter :
      RegisteredAnalyticSiteTheorem State decomposition.Piece objective)
    (state : State)
    (site : decomposition.Piece)
    (externalOnly : ExternalOnlyAt theoremAdapter state site) :
    ¬ ∃ proof : ¬ objective.requiresModification state site,
      theoremAdapter.assess state site = .safeToExclude proof :=
  external_theorem_cannot_certify_safe_exclusion theoremAdapter state site
    externalOnly.1 externalOnly.2

/-- A stage made only of unbridged external adapters retains the site. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/ReductiveSiteSelection/Variant572f006a09f39c1f6c596f4043a40723db36fea1a17ffb97d4d82520bde71c98.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/ReductiveSiteSelection/Variant572f006a09f39c1f6c596f4043a40723db36fea1a17ffb97d4d82520bde71c98.lean#L204).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7e02fb860ff80b2d21ede0fe05c37fd595249c23` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
