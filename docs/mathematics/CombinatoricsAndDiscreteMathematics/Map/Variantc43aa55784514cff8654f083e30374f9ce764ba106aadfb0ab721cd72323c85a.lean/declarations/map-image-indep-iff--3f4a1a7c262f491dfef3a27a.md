## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8160c91f-7a67-3821-12b1-93759c878d42`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 372–377.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma map_image_indep_iff {hf} {I : Set α} (hI : I ⊆ M.E) :
    (M.map f hf).Indep (f '' I) ↔ M.Indep I := by
  rw [map_indep_iff]
  refine ⟨fun ⟨J, hJ, hIJ⟩ ↦ ?_, fun h ↦ ⟨I, h, rfl⟩⟩
  rw [hf.image_eq_image_iff hI hJ.subset_ground] at hIJ; rwa [hIJ]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Map/Variantc43aa55784514cff8654f083e30374f9ce764ba106aadfb0ab721cd72323c85a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Map/Variantc43aa55784514cff8654f083e30374f9ce764ba106aadfb0ab721cd72323c85a.lean#L372).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `be555aebbb28a5d4a816cc1128a100b2bce8614f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
