## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ff1f460d-0d6f-b3d4-8ded-2fb180776bed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 475–491.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (step : ∀ a s, (∀ x ∈ s, a < x) → p s → p (insert a s)) : p s :=
  @induction_on_max αᵒᵈ _ _ _ s h0 step

end MaxMin

section MaxMinInductionValue

variable [LinearOrder α] [LinearOrder β]

/-- Induction principle for `Finset`s in any type from which a given function `f` maps to a linearly
ordered type : a predicate is true on all `s : Finset α` provided that:

* it is true on the empty `Finset`,
* for every `s : Finset α` and an element `a` such that for elements of `s` denoted by `x` we have
  `f x ≤ f a`, `p s` implies `p (insert a s)`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Max/Varianta8d630e3fdfa4fb13af046f4ac88c8edb195184113295e81a52911bb6f171960.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Max/Varianta8d630e3fdfa4fb13af046f4ac88c8edb195184113295e81a52911bb6f171960.lean#L475).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2b5cb5fa8b60245e7783fb11767a3567f6e5e406` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
