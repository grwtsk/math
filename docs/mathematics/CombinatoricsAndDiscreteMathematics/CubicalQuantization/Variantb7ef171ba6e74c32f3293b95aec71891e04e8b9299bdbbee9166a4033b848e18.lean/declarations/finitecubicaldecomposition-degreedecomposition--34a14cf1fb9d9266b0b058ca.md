## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0bf715d4d9fde44ea21fa081d78aa62f6abd8b58092907458e32a19882003c6e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 232–249.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def FiniteCubicalDecomposition.degreeDecomposition
    (decomposition : FiniteCubicalDecomposition)
    (degree : Nat)
    (identity : ArtifactIdentity) : FiniteDecomposition where
  Piece := decomposition.Cell degree
  pieceFintype := decomposition.cellFintype degree
  pieceDecEq := decomposition.cellDecidableEq degree
  identity := identity
  subjectAt := decomposition.subjectIdentity
  localEvidence := fun cell =>
    let evidence := decomposition.cellEvidence cell
    evidence.identity :: evidence.derivesFrom

/--
An explicit adapter that makes one bounded cubical degree available to the
surgical-selection layer.  Eligibility and stable ordering are supplied by
the `SurgicalSiteUniverse`; neither is inferred from cell or resolution data.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/CubicalQuantization/Variantb7ef171ba6e74c32f3293b95aec71891e04e8b9299bdbbee9166a4033b848e18.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/CubicalQuantization/Variantb7ef171ba6e74c32f3293b95aec71891e04e8b9299bdbbee9166a4033b848e18.lean#L232).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `581cf5fdb68bd3eab0b712929e78dfa87b4f63fa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
