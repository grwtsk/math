## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f46562b4-ba77-ece2-8d2c-ff3e55feab48`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 287–290.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Nat.cauchy_induction (h : ∀ n, P (n + 1) → P n) (seed : ℕ) (hs : P seed) (f : ℕ → ℕ)
    (hf : ∀ x, seed ≤ x → P x → x < f x ∧ P (f x)) (n : ℕ) : P n :=
  seed.cauchy_induction' h hs (fun x hl hx => ⟨f x, hf x hl hx⟩) n

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Nat/Variant2b126470b09f9d1cfabae0d14504bc547cffea70b8e2d1446a38492557754d0a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Nat/Variant2b126470b09f9d1cfabae0d14504bc547cffea70b8e2d1446a38492557754d0a.lean#L287).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6392b11fb2c972b6b55fd1ad96859ecbd0bc2610` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
