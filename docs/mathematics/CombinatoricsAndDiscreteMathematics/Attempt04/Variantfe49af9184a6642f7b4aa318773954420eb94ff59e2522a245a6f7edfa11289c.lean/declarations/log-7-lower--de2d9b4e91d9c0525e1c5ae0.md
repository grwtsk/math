## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a9b24cb3-1d40-6445-56d4-f0ed6e825c4d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–100.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem log_7_lower : (19459:ℝ)/10000 ≤ Real.log 7 := by
  have h := Real.sum_range_le_log_div (x := ((3:ℝ)/11)) (by norm_num) (by norm_num) 5
  have hid : Real.log 7 = 2*Real.log 2 + Real.log ((7:ℝ)/4) := by
    rw [Real.log_div (by norm_num) (by norm_num)]
    have hp : Real.log (4:ℝ) = 2*Real.log 2 := by
      convert Real.log_pow (2:ℝ) 2 using 1 <;> norm_num

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Attempt04/Variantfe49af9184a6642f7b4aa318773954420eb94ff59e2522a245a6f7edfa11289c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Attempt04/Variantfe49af9184a6642f7b4aa318773954420eb94ff59e2522a245a6f7edfa11289c.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b254449c4d37d30540ffa8827a7f50b6be413f6c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
