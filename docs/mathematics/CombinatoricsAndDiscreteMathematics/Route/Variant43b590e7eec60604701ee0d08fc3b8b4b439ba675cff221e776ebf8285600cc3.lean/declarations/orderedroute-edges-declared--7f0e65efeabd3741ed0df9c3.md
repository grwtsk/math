## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0ec4e8f8-f621-bd43-018f-224579d32f22`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 508–518.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem orderedRoute_edges_declared
    (contract : RoutingContract Host EdgeId) (start : Host)
    {edgeId : EdgeId}
    (member : edgeId ∈ (contract.orderedRoute start).discoveryEdges) :
    ∃ edge ∈ contract.edges, edge.edgeId = edgeId := by
  have valid := routeLoop_edges_declared contract (Fintype.card Host)
      (initialRouteState (EdgeId := EdgeId) start)
      (by simp [DiscoveryEdgesDeclared, initialRouteState])
  apply valid edgeId
  simpa only [orderedRoute] using member

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Route/Variant43b590e7eec60604701ee0d08fc3b8b4b439ba675cff221e776ebf8285600cc3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Route/Variant43b590e7eec60604701ee0d08fc3b8b4b439ba675cff221e776ebf8285600cc3.lean#L508).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `361aa0e4549e8cfeaf3671dbdda499cfa5aa6991` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
