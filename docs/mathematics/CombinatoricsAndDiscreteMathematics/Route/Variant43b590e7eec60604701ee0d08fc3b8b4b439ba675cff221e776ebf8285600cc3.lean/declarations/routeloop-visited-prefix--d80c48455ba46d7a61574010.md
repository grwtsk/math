## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f0b3c09f-4c40-dec9-b39d-14a43d91d37e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 581–602.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem routeLoop_visited_prefix
    (contract : RoutingContract Host EdgeId)
    (fuel : Nat) (state : RouteState Host EdgeId) :
    state.visited <+: (routeLoop contract fuel state).visited := by
  induction fuel generalizing state with
  | zero => exact List.prefix_refl _
  | succ fuel ih =>
      simp only [routeLoop]
      split
      · exact List.prefix_refl _
      · rename_i host remaining queueEquation
        let dequeued : RouteState Host EdgeId :=
          { state with
            processed := state.processed ++ [host]
            queue := remaining }
        exact (discoverOutgoing_visited_prefix dequeued
          (contract.orderedOutgoingEdges host)).trans
            (ih (discoverOutgoing dequeued (contract.orderedOutgoingEdges host)))

/-! The state partition is the finite accounting invariant used to prove that
`Fintype.card Host` fuel exhausts the queue. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Route/Variant43b590e7eec60604701ee0d08fc3b8b4b439ba675cff221e776ebf8285600cc3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Route/Variant43b590e7eec60604701ee0d08fc3b8b4b439ba675cff221e776ebf8285600cc3.lean#L581).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `361aa0e4549e8cfeaf3671dbdda499cfa5aa6991` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
