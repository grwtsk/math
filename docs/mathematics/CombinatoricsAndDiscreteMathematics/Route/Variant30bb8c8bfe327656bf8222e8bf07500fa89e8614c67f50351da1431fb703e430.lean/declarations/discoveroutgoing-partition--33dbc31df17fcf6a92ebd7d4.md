## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e014e82a-6290-f750-3704-52f3248d4795`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 614–625.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem discoverOutgoing_partition
    (state : RouteState Host EdgeId)
    (edges : List (DeclaredEdge Host EdgeId))
    (partition : StatePartition state) :
    StatePartition (discoverOutgoing state edges) := by
  induction edges generalizing state with
  | nil => exact partition
  | cons edge tail ih =>
      simp only [discoverOutgoing, List.foldl_cons]
      exact ih (discoverOne state edge)
        (discoverOne_partition state edge partition)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Route/Variant30bb8c8bfe327656bf8222e8bf07500fa89e8614c67f50351da1431fb703e430.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Route/Variant30bb8c8bfe327656bf8222e8bf07500fa89e8614c67f50351da1431fb703e430.lean#L614).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bef355055175d174cdcf1916aa188fb0f7c6e8c3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
