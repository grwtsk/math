## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ced0ef63-3327-cdb3-7772-ed68f90e699b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 890–907.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem orderedRoute_hosts_reachable
    (contract : RoutingContract Host EdgeId) (start host : Host)
    (member : host ∈ (contract.orderedRoute start).hosts) :
    contract.Reachable start host := by
  let initial : RouteState Host EdgeId :=
    initialRouteState (EdgeId := EdgeId) start
  have partition : StatePartition initial := by
    simp [initial, StatePartition, initialRouteState]
  have reachable : StateReachable contract start initial := by
    intro point pointMember
    simp [initial, initialRouteState] at pointMember
    subst point
    exact Relation.ReflTransGen.refl
  have finalReachable := routeLoop_reachable contract start
    (Fintype.card Host) initial partition reachable
  apply finalReachable host
  simpa [orderedRoute, initial] using member

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Route/Variantfb32fd12b08e4bc1bfb948871807bdbbbe9a24742fdedb641b545f31021f36c7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Route/Variantfb32fd12b08e4bc1bfb948871807bdbbbe9a24742fdedb641b545f31021f36c7.lean#L890).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0c12d6ecc394bd70f1c512552be0886224107d68` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
