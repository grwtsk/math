## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9770d697-8f4f-42f4-a7a6-dfdb2fee9a6a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 811–817.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sup'_map {s : Finset γ} {f : γ ↪ β} (g : β → α) (hs : (s.map f).Nonempty) :
    (s.map f).sup' hs g = s.sup' (map_nonempty.1 hs) (g ∘ f) := by
  rw [← WithBot.coe_eq_coe, coe_sup', sup_map, coe_sup']
  rfl

/-- A version of `Finset.sup'_map` with LHS and RHS reversed.
Also, this lemma assumes that `s` is nonempty instead of assuming that its image is nonempty. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Fold/Variantf4d1fa988f2c9692dea611eabf8b6084d7f40ee6bb661bf302793d84a2b07be0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Fold/Variantf4d1fa988f2c9692dea611eabf8b6084d7f40ee6bb661bf302793d84a2b07be0.lean#L811).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8f80d574b0c736d498711bed6b3cbc271036ae5b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
