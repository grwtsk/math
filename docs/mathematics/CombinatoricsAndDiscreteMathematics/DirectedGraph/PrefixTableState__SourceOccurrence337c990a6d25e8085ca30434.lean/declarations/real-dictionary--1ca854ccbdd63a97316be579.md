## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8ebe46ab-9f40-6ed1-4c53-ddc782e9907a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 223–239.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem real_dictionary (state : State V Key) (rows : List (Key × Occurrence state.root)) :
    (realPacked state rows).dictionary = extendedDictionary state rows := by
  have hmissing : IncrementalDictionary.missingPayloads (extendedDictionary state rows)
      (traceRows rows) = [] := by
    unfold IncrementalDictionary.missingPayloads
    apply (List.dedup_eq_nil _).mpr
    apply List.filter_eq_nil_iff.mpr
    intro initial hmem
    obtain ⟨entry, hentry, rfl⟩ := List.mem_map.mp hmem
    obtain ⟨row, hrow, rfl⟩ := List.mem_map.mp hentry
    have hnew := (mem_extended_iff state rows _).mpr
      (Or.inr (trace_mem_inventory rows row hrow))
    simp [hnew]
  simp only [realPacked, IncrementalDictionary.appendEntries, basePacked, replaceDictionary]
  rw [IncrementalDictionary.expandedDictionary, hmissing, List.append_nil]

/-- Update actual stored data without recanonicalizing the old dictionary or old cells. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/DirectedGraph/PrefixTableState__SourceOccurrence337c990a6d25e8085ca30434.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Combinatorics/DirectedGraph/PrefixTableState.lean#L223).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cdc163ad6de5c4c0f69405f1d2cdcd20b137d037` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
