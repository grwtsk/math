## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9d52b40f-03ac-d39b-6132-7b204b61a798`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–132.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem expandDictionary_state (state : State V Key) (hstate : WellFormed state) :
    expandDictionary state.nodes = some state.dictionary := by
  have hlength : state.nodes.length = state.dictionary.length := by
    rw [hstate.cells, List.length_map]
  have hbound (slot : Fin state.nodes.length) : slot.1 < state.dictionary.length :=
    hlength ▸ slot.2
  have hfun : (fun slot : Fin state.nodes.length => decodeSlot state.nodes slot.1) =
      (fun slot : Fin state.nodes.length => some (state.dictionary[slot.1]'(hbound slot))) := by
    funext slot
    exact decodeSlot_state state hstate slot.1 _ (List.getElem_mem (hbound slot))
      (List.getElem?_eq_getElem (hbound slot))
  have hlist : (List.finRange state.nodes.length).map
      (fun slot => state.dictionary[slot.1]'(hbound slot)) = state.dictionary := by
    rw [← List.ofFn_eq_map]
    apply List.ext_getElem
    · simp only [List.length_ofFn, hlength]
    · intro index hleft hright
      simp only [List.getElem_ofFn]
  unfold expandDictionary
  rw [hfun]
  calc
    _ = some ((List.finRange state.nodes.length).map
        (fun slot => state.dictionary[slot.1]'(hbound slot))) := List.mapM_pure
    _ = some state.dictionary := congrArg some hlist

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/DirectedGraph/PrefixTableState__SourceOccurrence337c990a6d25e8085ca30434.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Combinatorics/DirectedGraph/PrefixTableState.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cdc163ad6de5c4c0f69405f1d2cdcd20b137d037` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
