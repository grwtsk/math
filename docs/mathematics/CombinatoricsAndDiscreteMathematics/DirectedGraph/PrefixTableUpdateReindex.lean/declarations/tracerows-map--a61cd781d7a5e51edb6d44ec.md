## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9786a9bb-55f2-9f03-666b-d4c8bbdef972`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–66.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem traceRows_map (root : Vertex old role) (rows : List (Key × Occurrence root)) :
    traceRows (mapOccurrenceRows translation role root rows) =
      mapRows translation role (traceRows rows) := by
  simp only [traceRows, mapOccurrenceRows, mapRows, List.map_map, Function.comp_def,
    trace_mapOccurrence]

variable [DecidableEq (EdgeTrace.TotalEdge (Vertex old role))]
variable [DecidableEq (EdgeTrace.TotalEdge (Vertex new role))]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/DirectedGraph/PrefixTableUpdateReindex.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Combinatorics/DirectedGraph/PrefixTableUpdateReindex.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f8f334e1f5cb3a723a9e1292e174c9aa35b77211` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
