## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `elab_rules` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:addf4ee6a8e7c713cfc96a0bee4cbdde8cc27e8b34a0aa7b544958e2c4267155`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 124–133.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[tactic finCases] elab_rules : tactic
  | `(tactic| fin_cases $[$hyps:ident],*) => withMainContext <| focus do
    for h in hyps do
      allGoals <| liftMetaTactic (finCasesAt · (← getFVarId h))

end Tactic

end Elab

end Lean
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/FinCases/Variantb0c1d456a20b86862b5ece70d24c65ccbe650adaf077c131da15f0a4b7da6f56.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/FinCases/Variantb0c1d456a20b86862b5ece70d24c65ccbe650adaf077c131da15f0a4b7da6f56.lean#L124).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
