## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a246d5d8-80ce-d862-10d3-7b7c8051b8b2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 238–244.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem weightedOrder_monomial_of_ne_zero {d : σ →₀ ℕ} {a : R} (h : a ≠ 0) :
    weightedOrder w (monomial R d a) = weight w d := by
  classical
  rw [weightedOrder_monomial, if_neg h]


/-- The order of the sum of two formal power series is at least the minimum of their orders. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Order/Variant578041cdf949edfbc03a221a0df9381bee6450f5c792cf83eb3dc5812d897f5e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Order/Variant578041cdf949edfbc03a221a0df9381bee6450f5c792cf83eb3dc5812d897f5e.lean#L238).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `df725abc04836c86bb4ef6298c33165e5493b220` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
