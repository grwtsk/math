## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:48a125c90a7e6b2232af5dd9042271b23e6362a4c19c2a4a20745b5a947cc1ea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–170.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def isoSubgraphMap (f : Copy A B) (A' : A.Subgraph) :
    A'.coe ≃g (A'.map f.toHom).coe := by
  use Equiv.Set.image f.toHom _ f.injective
  simp_rw [Subgraph.map_verts, Equiv.Set.image_apply, Subgraph.coe_adj, Subgraph.map_adj,
    Relation.map_apply, f.injective.eq_iff, exists_eq_right_right, exists_eq_right, forall_true_iff]

/-- The subgraph of `B` corresponding to a copy of `A` inside `B`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Copy/Variant6baf36ab48c497454e867a01631d42dc476740d8f79b2bb4bf4f9b1393d8d1ff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Copy/Variant6baf36ab48c497454e867a01631d42dc476740d8f79b2bb4bf4f9b1393d8d1ff.lean#L164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dd97628b246046c05d7d746b1448f3f2d5010d6a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
