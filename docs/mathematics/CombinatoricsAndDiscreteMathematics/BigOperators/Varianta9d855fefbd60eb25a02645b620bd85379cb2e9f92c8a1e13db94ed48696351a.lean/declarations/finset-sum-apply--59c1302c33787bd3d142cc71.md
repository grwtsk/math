## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:683ce725-25ea-4f65-43f6-2915dcaf26cd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 69–80.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem finset_sum_apply {α} [∀ i, AddCommMonoid (β i)] (s : Finset α) (g : α → Π₀ i, β i) (i : ι) :
    (∑ a ∈ s, g a) i = ∑ a ∈ s, g a i :=
  map_sum (evalAddMonoidHom i) g s

end Algebra

section ProdAndSum

variable [DecidableEq ι]

/-- `DFinsupp.prod f g` is the product of `g i (f i)` over the support of `f`. -/
@[to_additive "`sum f g` is the sum of `g i (f i)` over the support of `f`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/BigOperators/Varianta9d855fefbd60eb25a02645b620bd85379cb2e9f92c8a1e13db94ed48696351a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/BigOperators/Varianta9d855fefbd60eb25a02645b620bd85379cb2e9f92c8a1e13db94ed48696351a.lean#L69).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
