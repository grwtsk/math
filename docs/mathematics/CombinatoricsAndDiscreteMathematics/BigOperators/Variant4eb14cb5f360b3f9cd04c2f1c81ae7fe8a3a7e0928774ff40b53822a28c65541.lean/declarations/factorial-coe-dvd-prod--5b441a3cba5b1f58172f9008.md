## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:66ab190d-545f-43fe-28fb-58f240b20327`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma factorial_coe_dvd_prod (k : ℕ) (n : ℤ) : (k ! : ℤ) ∣ ∏ i ∈ range k, (n + i) := by
  rw [Int.dvd_iff_emod_eq_zero, Finset.prod_int_mod]
  simp_rw [← Int.emod_add_emod n]
  have hn : 0 ≤ n % k ! := Int.emod_nonneg n <| Int.natCast_ne_zero.mpr k.factorial_ne_zero
  obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ := Int.eq_ofNat_of_zero_le hn
  have hdivk := x.factorial_dvd_ascFactorial k
  zify [x.ascFactorial_eq_prod_range k] at hdivk
  rwa [← Finset.prod_int_mod, ← Int.dvd_iff_emod_eq_zero, hx]

end Nat
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/BigOperators/Variant4eb14cb5f360b3f9cd04c2f1c81ae7fe8a3a7e0928774ff40b53822a28c65541.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/BigOperators/Variant4eb14cb5f360b3f9cd04c2f1c81ae7fe8a3a7e0928774ff40b53822a28c65541.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6e341dc41e93dcfc2bbc04b439d79f81dfe9c32b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
