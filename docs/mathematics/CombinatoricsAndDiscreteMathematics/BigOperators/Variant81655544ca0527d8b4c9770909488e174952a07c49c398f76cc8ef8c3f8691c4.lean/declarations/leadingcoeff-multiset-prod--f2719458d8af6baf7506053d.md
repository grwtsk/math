## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:505e8bec-3440-6b31-3ec4-2ce1bf3f1f83`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 361–371.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem leadingCoeff_multiset_prod :
    t.prod.leadingCoeff = (t.map fun f => leadingCoeff f).prod := by
  rw [← leadingCoeffHom_apply, MonoidHom.map_multiset_prod]
  simp only [leadingCoeffHom_apply]

/-- The leading coefficient of a product of polynomials is equal to
the product of the leading coefficients.

See `Polynomial.leadingCoeff_prod'` (with a `'`) for a version for commutative semirings,
where additionally, the product of the leading coefficients must be nonzero.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/BigOperators/Variant81655544ca0527d8b4c9770909488e174952a07c49c398f76cc8ef8c3f8691c4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/BigOperators/Variant81655544ca0527d8b4c9770909488e174952a07c49c398f76cc8ef8c3f8691c4.lean#L361).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c2293cbcd11758f4924d3f3f932dd371b18eb961` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
