## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:36f64597b14c91bb5c5e4076aadcfc7912a92167b020c3865605bf67d84e9dae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–63.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure SemistandardYoungTableau (μ : YoungDiagram) where
  /-- `entry i j` is value of the `(i, j)` entry of the SSYT `μ`. -/
  entry : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
  /-- The entries in each row are weakly increasing (left to right). -/
  row_weak' : ∀ {i j1 j2 : ℕ}, j1 < j2 → (i, j2) ∈ μ → entry i j1 ≤ entry i j2
  /-- The entries in each column are strictly increasing (top to bottom). -/
  col_strict' : ∀ {i1 i2 j : ℕ}, i1 < i2 → (i2, j) ∈ μ → entry i1 j < entry i2 j
  /-- `entry` is required to be zero for all pairs `(i, j) ∉ μ`. -/
  zeros' : ∀ {i j}, (i, j) ∉ μ → entry i j = 0

namespace SemistandardYoungTableau

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/SemistandardTableau/Variant2bbb43062234ac3ba2c9f911bf6aab2c68a1cdfd891cab1a304c86927741a123.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/SemistandardTableau/Variant2bbb43062234ac3ba2c9f911bf6aab2c68a1cdfd891cab1a304c86927741a123.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3568197c76b771ca85c77a4526fbcba678f85e1f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
