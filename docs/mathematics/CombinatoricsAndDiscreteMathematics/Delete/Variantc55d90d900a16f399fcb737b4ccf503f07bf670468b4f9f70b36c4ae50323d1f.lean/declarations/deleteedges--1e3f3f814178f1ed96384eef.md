## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:833661de4b4b4aea893f4e13ab4b44c9f317a194033f5bd5205e8683f5141bb0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def deleteEdges (G : Graph α β) (F : Set β) : Graph α β :=
  (G.restrict (E(G) \ F)).copy (edgeSet := E(G) \ F)
  (IsLink := fun e x y ↦ G.IsLink e x y ∧ e ∉ F) rfl (by simp)
  (fun e x y ↦ by
    simp only [restrict_isLink, mem_sdiff, and_comm, and_congr_left_iff, and_iff_left_iff_imp]
    exact fun h _ ↦ h.edge_mem)

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Delete/Variantc55d90d900a16f399fcb737b4ccf503f07bf670468b4f9f70b36c4ae50323d1f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Delete/Variantc55d90d900a16f399fcb737b4ccf503f07bf670468b4f9f70b36c4ae50323d1f.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fda2664e1edf115d36e51ca14a5400ec1db9f3f4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
