## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ea89f196-21a4-d1af-5c1b-c05e4ed91f88`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 386–394.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_of_card_le_finset [Fintype α] {s : Finset β} (h : Fintype.card α ≤ #s) :
    ∃ f : α ↪ β, Set.range f ⊆ s := by
  rw [← Fintype.card_coe] at h
  rcases nonempty_of_card_le h with ⟨f⟩
  exact ⟨f.trans (Embedding.subtype _), by simp [Set.range_subset_iff]⟩

end Function.Embedding

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/EquivFin/Variant12495a0afd4e4b5abcf91019d852c59788816f9711bcfd57ab5bfb2df6c649b5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/EquivFin/Variant12495a0afd4e4b5abcf91019d852c59788816f9711bcfd57ab5bfb2df6c649b5.lean#L386).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ae3995a5ad5705e6ebc722e07935000ddea506e4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
