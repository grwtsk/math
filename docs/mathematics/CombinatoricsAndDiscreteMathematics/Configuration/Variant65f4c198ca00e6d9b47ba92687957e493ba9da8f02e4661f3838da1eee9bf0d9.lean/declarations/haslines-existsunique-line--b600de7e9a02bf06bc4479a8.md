## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:26fcca59-3f73-987e-5f9e-3ad2e8a4e495`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 115–122.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem HasLines.existsUnique_line [HasLines P L] (p₁ p₂ : P) (hp : p₁ ≠ p₂) :
    ∃! l : L, p₁ ∈ l ∧ p₂ ∈ l :=
  HasPoints.existsUnique_point (Dual L) (Dual P) p₁ p₂ hp

variable {P L}

/-- If a nondegenerate configuration has at least as many points as lines, then there exists
  an injective function `f` from lines to points, such that `f l` does not lie on `l`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Configuration/Variant65f4c198ca00e6d9b47ba92687957e493ba9da8f02e4661f3838da1eee9bf0d9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Configuration/Variant65f4c198ca00e6d9b47ba92687957e493ba9da8f02e4661f3838da1eee9bf0d9.lean#L115).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `49f83a1401d6b840707153706b768b5e2bd1d8f4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
