## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:13d32c8d156b7db6c8badfbb8c88cad72a8d54ce784db7deabf64c1ede940cd5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 114–132.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance geodesicArborescence : Arborescence (geodesicSubtree r) :=
  arborescenceMk r (fun a => (shortestPath r a).length)
    (by
      rintro a b ⟨e, p, h⟩
      simp_rw [h, Path.length_cons, Nat.lt_succ_iff]
      apply shortest_path_spec)
    (by
      rintro a b c ⟨e, p, h⟩ ⟨f, q, j⟩
      cases h.symm.trans j
      constructor <;> rfl)
    (by
      intro b
      rcases hp : shortestPath r b with (_ | ⟨p, e⟩)
      · exact Or.inl rfl
      · exact Or.inr ⟨_, ⟨⟨e, p, hp⟩⟩⟩)

end GeodesicSubtree

end Quiver
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Arborescence/Variantfa091a05bffc65589aa1f5d187a52472fe0f07133adf908ac8510b00c0febfc9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Arborescence/Variantfa091a05bffc65589aa1f5d187a52472fe0f07133adf908ac8510b00c0febfc9.lean#L114).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `44f2fe930821c342ff0c80cc1d351aeb4513a176` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
