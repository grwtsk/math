## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4aa5ace3cb3696bc8bf5b1c468c589f188b42114cfe49c739a89dabbc242c083`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 102–109.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def boxProdLeft (b : β) : G ↪g G □ H where
  toFun a := (a, b)
  inj' _ _ := congr_arg Prod.fst
  map_rel_iff' {_ _} := boxProd_adj_left
#align simple_graph.box_prod_left SimpleGraph.boxProdLeft

/-- The embedding of `H` into `G □ H` given by `a`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Prod/Variantf931f80c5f470f3ca291c1fe9833a7aa34f451dc8a1bd56d9f7be9850fc3396b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Prod/Variantf931f80c5f470f3ca291c1fe9833a7aa34f451dc8a1bd56d9f7be9850fc3396b.lean#L102).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `12b2c84447356740af6b70ed4eac96d6a769074b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
