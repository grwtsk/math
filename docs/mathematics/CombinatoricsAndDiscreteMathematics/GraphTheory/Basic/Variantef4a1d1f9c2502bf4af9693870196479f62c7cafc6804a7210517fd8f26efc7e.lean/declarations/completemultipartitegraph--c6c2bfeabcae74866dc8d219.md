## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b714f1fb0a8b5e7eb889059ee09e09d3828ed59fc65939ad80f26f5fd58ac50d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1303–1314.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev completeMultipartiteGraph {ι : Type*} (V : ι → Type*) : SimpleGraph (Σ i, V i) :=
  SimpleGraph.comap Sigma.fst ⊤

/-! ## Induced graphs -/

/- Given a set `s` of vertices, we can restrict a graph to those vertices by restricting its
adjacency relation. This gives a map between `SimpleGraph V` and `SimpleGraph s`.

There is also a notion of induced subgraphs (see `SimpleGraph.subgraph.induce`). -/
/-- Restrict a graph to the vertices in the set `s`, deleting all edges incident to vertices
outside the set. This is a wrapper around `SimpleGraph.comap`. -/
@[reducible]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Basic/Variantef4a1d1f9c2502bf4af9693870196479f62c7cafc6804a7210517fd8f26efc7e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Basic/Variantef4a1d1f9c2502bf4af9693870196479f62c7cafc6804a7210517fd8f26efc7e.lean#L1303).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `eea88525d368ce174086f9ca2c19dcb98ebe63c1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
