## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:36807bb5-e054-a12a-c77b-5981c982ba4c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 656–660.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem chain'_adj_support {u v : V} : ∀ (p : G.Walk u v), List.Chain' G.Adj p.support
  | nil => List.Chain.nil
  | cons h p => chain_adj_support h p
#align simple_graph.walk.chain'_adj_support SimpleGraph.Walk.chain'_adj_support

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Connectivity/Variant59709ea228fca278a9b001f3d77e465abaaa064a57a67c8f6bbdf367b4cb0f72.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Connectivity/Variant59709ea228fca278a9b001f3d77e465abaaa064a57a67c8f6bbdf367b4cb0f72.lean#L656).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `53c05f5b92557ea8bfa7db27d4385cf57276d5ae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
