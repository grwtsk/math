## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:51cdf8c2-b8ad-f41c-8afd-8d8e1209ef92`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Coloring.valid {v w : V} (h : G.Adj v w) : C v ≠ C w :=
  C.map_rel h
#align simple_graph.coloring.valid SimpleGraph.Coloring.valid

/-- Construct a term of `SimpleGraph.Coloring` using a function that
assigns vertices to colors and a proof that it is as proper coloring.

(Note: this is a definitionally the constructor for `SimpleGraph.Hom`,
but with a syntactically better proper coloring hypothesis.)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Coloring/Variant29bf8707bd78bda22ab97b4d9a1ef5c169a2094c1c2f476079ead923854efb8b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Coloring/Variant29bf8707bd78bda22ab97b4d9a1ef5c169a2094c1c2f476079ead923854efb8b.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dc12d6ff80a09a327acf067707a4803edc9c87a9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
