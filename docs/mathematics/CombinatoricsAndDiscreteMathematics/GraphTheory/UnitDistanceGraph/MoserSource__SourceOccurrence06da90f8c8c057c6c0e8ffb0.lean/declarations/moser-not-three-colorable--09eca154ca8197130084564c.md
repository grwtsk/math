## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cd18f900-06ad-a26b-7499-7b52882581f6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 51–63.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma moser_not_three_colorable (f : Fin 7 → Fin 3)
    (hf : ∀ i j, (i, j) ∈ moserEdges → f i ≠ f j) : False := by
  have h03 : f 0=f 3 := three_color_diamond
    (hf 1 2 (by decide)) (hf 0 1 (by decide)) (hf 0 2 (by decide))
    (hf 3 1 (by decide)) (hf 3 2 (by decide))
  have h06 : f 0=f 6 := three_color_diamond
    (hf 4 5 (by decide)) (hf 0 4 (by decide)) (hf 0 5 (by decide))
    (hf 6 4 (by decide)) (hf 6 5 (by decide))
  exact hf 3 6 (by decide) (h03.symm.trans h06)

end

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/UnitDistanceGraph/MoserSource__SourceOccurrence06da90f8c8c057c6c0e8ffb0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Combinatorics/GraphTheory/UnitDistanceGraph/MoserSource.lean#L51).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b8a0080ceaa5d38b125c12baa25000afe585095c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
