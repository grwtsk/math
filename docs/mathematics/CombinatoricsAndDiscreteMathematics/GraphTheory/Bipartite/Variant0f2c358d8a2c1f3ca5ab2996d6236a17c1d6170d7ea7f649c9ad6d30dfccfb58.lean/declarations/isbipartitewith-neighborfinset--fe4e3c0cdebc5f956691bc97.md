## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:77451688-6b24-076d-ecb9-5b10e599ea45`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 183–190.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isBipartiteWith_neighborFinset' (h : G.IsBipartiteWith s t) (hw : w ∈ t) :
    G.neighborFinset w = { v ∈ s | G.Adj v w } := by
  ext v
  rw [mem_neighborFinset, adj_comm, mem_filter, iff_and_self]
  exact h.mem_of_mem_adj' hw

/-- If `G.IsBipartiteWith s t` and `v ∈ s`, then the neighbor finset of `v` is the set of vertices
"above" `v` according to the adjacency relation of `G`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Bipartite/Variant0f2c358d8a2c1f3ca5ab2996d6236a17c1d6170d7ea7f649c9ad6d30dfccfb58.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Bipartite/Variant0f2c358d8a2c1f3ca5ab2996d6236a17c1d6170d7ea7f649c9ad6d30dfccfb58.lean#L183).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fbf216e964a59127e6a1b2c1a91c80ce906d8f40` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
