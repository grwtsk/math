## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a0b1b474-01d2-e6af-d04a-681d0a58bfd9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 446–456.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma ncard_neighborSet_toSubgraph_eq_two {u v} {p : G.Walk u u} (hpc : p.IsCycle)
    (h : v ∈ p.support) : (p.toSubgraph.neighborSet v).ncard = 2 := by
  simp only [SimpleGraph.Walk.mem_support_iff_exists_getVert] at h ⊢
  obtain ⟨i, hi⟩ := h
  by_cases! he : i = 0 ∨ i = p.length
  · have huv : u = v := by aesop
    rw [← huv, hpc.neighborSet_toSubgraph_endpoint]
    exact Set.ncard_pair hpc.snd_ne_penultimate
  rw [← hi.1, hpc.neighborSet_toSubgraph_internal he.1 (by lia)]
  exact Set.ncard_pair (hpc.getVert_sub_one_ne_getVert_add_one (by lia))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Subgraph/Variant4ee6ab7cd9484d807d33982443db5a27830729c28e437a18cc4fe20e6a4d5756.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Subgraph/Variant4ee6ab7cd9484d807d33982443db5a27830729c28e437a18cc4fe20e6a4d5756.lean#L446).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6adfd918a29f0dfe270ed00c87365521ef60669d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
