## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cc32e3813b858af30aaa3143580c45fa536b22d0cd66b2442fb3509e902bcb6c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 770–774.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def finiteAtOfSubgraph {G' G'' : Subgraph G} [DecidableRel G'.Adj] (h : G' ≤ G'') (v : G'.verts)
    [Fintype (G''.neighborSet v)] : Fintype (G'.neighborSet v) :=
  Set.fintypeSubset (G''.neighborSet v) (neighborSet_subset_of_subgraph h v)
#align simple_graph.subgraph.finite_at_of_subgraph SimpleGraph.Subgraph.finiteAtOfSubgraph

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Subgraph/Variant86678b8189b220925bf946988140bba28ed799eeae6339450781c827286f93cb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Subgraph/Variant86678b8189b220925bf946988140bba28ed799eeae6339450781c827286f93cb.lean#L770).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9518e8ea4199211e36db009cb674e98f86e02642` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
