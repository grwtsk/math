## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6f0f1f9c11b64887798657c2d3fd934e683f3eaa5d81d949fa2703c19d5f9fbf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 770–777.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance finiteAt {G' : Subgraph G} (v : G'.verts) [DecidableRel G'.Adj]
    [Fintype (G.neighborSet v)] : Fintype (G'.neighborSet v) :=
  Set.fintypeSubset (G.neighborSet v) (G'.neighborSet_subset v)
#align simple_graph.subgraph.finite_at SimpleGraph.Subgraph.finiteAt

/-- If a subgraph is locally finite at a vertex, then so are subgraphs of that subgraph.

This is not an instance because `G''` cannot be inferred. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Subgraph/Variant47d689b95c9d1d2128f01f54e885e5c97387544690e111c77a2c81d8eaeb80d3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphTheory/Subgraph/Variant47d689b95c9d1d2128f01f54e885e5c97387544690e111c77a2c81d8eaeb80d3.lean#L770).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9d908d52aa1c3cbd46d39162122afa608ab746c5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
