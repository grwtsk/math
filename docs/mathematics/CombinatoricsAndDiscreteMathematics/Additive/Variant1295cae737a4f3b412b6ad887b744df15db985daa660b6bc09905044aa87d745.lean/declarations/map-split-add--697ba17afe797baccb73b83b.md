## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1b0fd080-f4d7-bccd-a2ed-e48fff6d8123`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 133–139.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_split_add (f : ι →ᵇᵃ[I₀] M) (hI : ↑I ≤ I₀) (i : ι) (x : ℝ) :
    (I.splitLower i x).elim' 0 f + (I.splitUpper i x).elim' 0 f = f I := by
  rw [← f.sum_partition_boxes hI (isPartitionSplit I i x), sum_split_boxes]

/-- If `f` is box-additive on subboxes of `I₀`, then it is box-additive on subboxes of any
`I ≤ I₀`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Additive/Variant1295cae737a4f3b412b6ad887b744df15db985daa660b6bc09905044aa87d745.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Additive/Variant1295cae737a4f3b412b6ad887b744df15db985daa660b6bc09905044aa87d745.lean#L133).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `61fb2e528f253707440b02c0cd6efbc9b945a9e1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
