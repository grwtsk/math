## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:244fc9ae96d40e30356812e16a56eeb664505f787380c54007a1406a489574bc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 172–180.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def prototypeAssumptionId (model : PrototypeModel) : AssumptionId :=
  ⟨"assumption:" ++ (prototypeModelId model).value ++ ":finite-scope"⟩

/--
Trusted-base metadata for the pinned Lean route used by a wrapper.  The source
tree is Lean-checked, but these semantic wrapper records are not yet populated
from the compiled-environment export.  Consequently the observed closure is
empty and, critically, `closureComplete` remains false.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Models/Variant7d6330e0b01f1aae4f843721c334300d74517dcfb1e39463b752f1d76ca04c14.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Models/Variant7d6330e0b01f1aae4f843721c334300d74517dcfb1e39463b752f1d76ca04c14.lean#L172).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f62a33aef36c1b7a56d85399cf70a66d9024d9bf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
