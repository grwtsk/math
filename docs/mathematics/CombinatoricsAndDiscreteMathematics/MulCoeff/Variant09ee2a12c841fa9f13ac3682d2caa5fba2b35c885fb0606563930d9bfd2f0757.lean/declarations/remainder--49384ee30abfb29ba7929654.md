## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bdc34570e73a052d03435e3542da8ce7bb5d0dccef1f5db09e162130b827bede`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 105–111.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def remainder (n : ℕ) : 𝕄 :=
  (∑ x : ℕ in range (n + 1),
    (rename (Prod.mk 0)) ((monomial (Finsupp.single x (p ^ (n + 1 - x)))) ((p : ℤ) ^ x))) *
   ∑ x : ℕ in range (n + 1),
    (rename (Prod.mk 1)) ((monomial (Finsupp.single x (p ^ (n + 1 - x)))) ((p : ℤ) ^ x))
#align witt_vector.remainder WittVector.remainder

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/MulCoeff/Variant09ee2a12c841fa9f13ac3682d2caa5fba2b35c885fb0606563930d9bfd2f0757.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/MulCoeff/Variant09ee2a12c841fa9f13ac3682d2caa5fba2b35c885fb0606563930d9bfd2f0757.lean#L105).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ef85b6119898c9be55488ff87f3322723b9b228` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
