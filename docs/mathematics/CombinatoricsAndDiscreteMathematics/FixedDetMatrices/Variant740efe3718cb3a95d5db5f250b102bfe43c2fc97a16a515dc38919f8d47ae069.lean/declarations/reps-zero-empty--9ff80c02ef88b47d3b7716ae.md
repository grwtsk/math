## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:92a7658e-b14b-5c0a-c392-93c448ffd54c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 161–167.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma reps_zero_empty : reps 0 = ∅ := by
  rw [reps, Set.eq_empty_iff_forall_notMem]
  rintro A ⟨h₁, h₂, -, h₄⟩
  suffices |A.1 0 1| < 0 by linarith [abs_nonneg (A.1 0 1)]
  have := A_c_eq_zero h₁
  simp_all [h₂.ne']

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/FixedDetMatrices/Variant740efe3718cb3a95d5db5f250b102bfe43c2fc97a16a515dc38919f8d47ae069.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/FixedDetMatrices/Variant740efe3718cb3a95d5db5f250b102bfe43c2fc97a16a515dc38919f8d47ae069.lean#L161).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4e4c109daecc1be7b9449c2925286a1c235bfd40` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
