## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e3953da5818e6910d0ec18b41664eb3c2210c02ed2b7f60f15b55ab86b60050c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–105.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def manifest : UniverseManifest where
  schemaVersion := 1
  sourceTreeDigest := sourceDigest
  toolchainDigest := toolchainDigest
  snapshotId := snapshotId
  nodes := {theoremNode}
  edges := {proofEdge}
  higherCells := {theoremCell}
  theoremCells := {theoremCellDescriptor}
  foldData := ∅

  externalAuthorities := ∅
  closedUnderReferences := by
    simp [ReferencesClosed, runtimeBinding, theoremNode, proofEdge,
      theoremCell, theoremCellDescriptor]
  identityInjective := by
    simp [NodeIdentityInjective]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GroundedLanguage/Variant167cb0d0461434d11baab2ab6a07468eeee1fda5c6ee1e6eca81ff1f6270090c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GroundedLanguage/Variant167cb0d0461434d11baab2ab6a07468eeee1fda5c6ee1e6eca81ff1f6270090c.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `46de24914dd25f20832dd0f05bfedd260246ffcc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
