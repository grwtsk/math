## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d72255a2a73ae9b6fb8168fb37c403037a8065e8965841d500e6330571b2f8ff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 181–191.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def logSizeBallStruct.ball (struct : logSizeBallStruct T) (c : ℝ≥0∞) :
    Finset T :=
  struct.finset.filter fun x ↦ edist struct.point x ≤ struct.radius * c

variable [DecidableEq T]

/-- We recursively define a log-size ball sequence `(Vᵢ, tᵢ, rᵢ)` by
  * `V₀ = J`, `t₀` is chosen arbitrarily in `J`, `r₀` is the log-size radius of `t₀` in `V₀`
  * `Vᵢ₊₁ = Vᵢ \ {x ∈ V | d(t, x) ≤ (rᵢ - 1)c}`, `tᵢ₊₁` is chosen arbitrarily in `Vᵢ₊₁`, `rᵢ₊₁` is
    the log-size radius of `tᵢ₊₁` in `Vᵢ₊₁`. -/
noncomputable
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/PairReduction/Variant73508d256ac442890ed9305f5bdb98d48190555a5e262f1d937194647aa519d0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/PairReduction/Variant73508d256ac442890ed9305f5bdb98d48190555a5e262f1d937194647aa519d0.lean#L181).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b34ec5b4da347b2b4ecd0adfffeaa09ad2cfe742` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
