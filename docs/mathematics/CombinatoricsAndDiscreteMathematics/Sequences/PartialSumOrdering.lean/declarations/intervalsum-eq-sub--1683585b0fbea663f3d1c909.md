## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:74bcc708-e9ea-fa38-7e86-1d01c81a73f9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 72–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem intervalSum_eq_sub (xs : List G) (a b : ℕ) (ha : 1 ≤ a) (hab : a ≤ b) :
    ((xs.drop (a - 1)).take (b + 1 - a)).sum =
      prefixSum xs b - prefixSum xs (a - 1) := by
  have hn : (a - 1) + (b + 1 - a) = b := by omega
  have h := congrArg (fun ys : List G => ys.sum)
    (List.take_add (l := xs) (i := a - 1) (j := b + 1 - a))
  rw [hn, List.sum_append] at h
  unfold prefixSum
  rw [h]
  abel

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Sequences/PartialSumOrdering.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Combinatorics/Sequences/PartialSumOrdering.lean#L72).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6e0d451eed2d082fa55d5b667183d85e6bb619cd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
