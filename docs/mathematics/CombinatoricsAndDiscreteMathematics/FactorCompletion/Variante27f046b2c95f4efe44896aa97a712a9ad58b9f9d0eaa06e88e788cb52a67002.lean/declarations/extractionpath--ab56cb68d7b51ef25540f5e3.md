## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:946c5ebfe1c47a67eb523c70b438fae7d2a2a3ff3265fdb1627c23511b499e3c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 29–35.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive ExtractionPath {N : ℕ} : State N → State N → ℕ → Prop
  | refl (s : State N) : ExtractionPath s s 0
  | step (s : State N) {p e after : ℕ} {t : State N} {k : ℕ}
      (c : ExactExtraction s.residual p e after) (small : p ≤ s.horizon)
      (tail : ExtractionPath (extract s c) t k) : ExtractionPath s t (k + 1)

/-- The reflexive path has an identity refinement certificate. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/FactorCompletion/Variante27f046b2c95f4efe44896aa97a712a9ad58b9f9d0eaa06e88e788cb52a67002.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/FactorCompletion/Variante27f046b2c95f4efe44896aa97a712a9ad58b9f9d0eaa06e88e788cb52a67002.lean#L29).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `90c7aa5f19b5fe7dbc82044798da9295d26732b2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
