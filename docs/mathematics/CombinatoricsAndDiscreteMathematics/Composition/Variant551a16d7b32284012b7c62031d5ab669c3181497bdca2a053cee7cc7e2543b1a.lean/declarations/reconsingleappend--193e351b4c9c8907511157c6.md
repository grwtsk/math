## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7ce532e07d141cecafadff18dd30f42b27f21387096a4e158fd1ceea30febe0f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 646–663.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def recOnSingleAppend {motive : ∀ n, Composition n → Sort*} {n : ℕ} (c : Composition n)
    (zero : motive 0 (ones 0))
    (single_append : ∀ k n c, motive n c →
      motive (k + 1 + n) (append (single (k + 1) k.succ_pos) c)) :
    motive n c :=
  match n, c with
  | _, ⟨blocks, blocks_pos, rfl⟩ =>
    match blocks with
    | [] => zero
    | 0 :: _ => by simp at blocks_pos
    | (k + 1) :: l =>
      single_append k l.sum ⟨l, fun hi ↦ blocks_pos <| mem_cons_of_mem _ hi, rfl⟩ <|
        recOnSingleAppend _ zero single_append
  decreasing_by simp

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Composition/Variant551a16d7b32284012b7c62031d5ab669c3181497bdca2a053cee7cc7e2543b1a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Composition/Variant551a16d7b32284012b7c62031d5ab669c3181497bdca2a053cee7cc7e2543b1a.lean#L646).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `34bd286bc74e0bc9295299ed82a8be1cb03b4328` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
