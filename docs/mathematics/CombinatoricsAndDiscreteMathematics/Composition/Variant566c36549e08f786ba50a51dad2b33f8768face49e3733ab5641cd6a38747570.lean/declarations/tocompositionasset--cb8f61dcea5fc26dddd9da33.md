## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fa49fe46b93c489db327b7787ee6d8534bf741284f936446ad9cb95b7a104337`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 291–303.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toCompositionAsSet : CompositionAsSet n
    where
  boundaries := c.boundaries
  zero_mem := by
    simp only [boundaries, Finset.mem_univ, exists_prop_of_true, Finset.mem_map]
    exact ⟨0, And.intro True.intro rfl⟩
  getLast_mem := by
    simp only [boundaries, Finset.mem_univ, exists_prop_of_true, Finset.mem_map]
    exact ⟨Fin.last c.length, And.intro True.intro c.boundary_last⟩
#align composition.to_composition_as_set Composition.toCompositionAsSet

/-- The canonical increasing bijection between `Fin (c.length + 1)` and `c.boundaries` is
exactly `c.boundary`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Composition/Variant566c36549e08f786ba50a51dad2b33f8768face49e3733ab5641cd6a38747570.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Composition/Variant566c36549e08f786ba50a51dad2b33f8768face49e3733ab5641cd6a38747570.lean#L291).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `743743d60cec862274d7d70ca71dbe0c2522cc39` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
