## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:76d92771-8896-dabf-9c00-0ec8d4ac5553`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 808–824.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem splitWrtComposition_flatten (L : List (List α)) (c : Composition L.flatten.length)
    (h : map length L = c.blocks) : splitWrtComposition (flatten L) c = L := by
  simp only [eq_self_iff_true, and_self_iff, eq_iff_flatten_eq, flatten_splitWrtComposition,
    map_length_splitWrtComposition, h]

end List

### Compositions as sets

Combinatorial viewpoints on compositions, seen as finite subsets of `Fin (n+1)` containing `0` and
`n`, where the points of the set (other than `n`) correspond to the leftmost points of each block.
-/


/-- Bijection between compositions of `n` and subsets of `{0, ..., n-2}`, defined by
considering the restriction of the subset to `{1, ..., n-1}` and shifting to the left by one. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Composition/Variant222cdc837d6b1ad4992f88937e15ccb6cef9452b6d74fafcc73fff337333ba06.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Composition/Variant222cdc837d6b1ad4992f88937e15ccb6cef9452b6d74fafcc73fff337333ba06.lean#L808).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `35a54407257146971c55c022fabc2a924f399de2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
