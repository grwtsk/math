## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d3639672ded494cf0b6e2265059a13c497ed9aaeb4ed052b75e8d7010899bf60`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 987–1004.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toComposition : Composition n where
  blocks := c.blocks
  blocks_pos := by simp only [blocks, forall_mem_ofFn_iff, blocksFun_pos c, forall_true_iff]
  blocks_sum := c.blocks_sum
#align composition_as_set.to_composition CompositionAsSet.toComposition

end CompositionAsSet

### Equivalence between compositions and compositions as sets

In this section, we explain how to go back and forth between a `Composition` and a
`CompositionAsSet`, by showing that their `blocks` and `length` and `boundaries` correspond to
each other, and construct an equivalence between them called `compositionEquiv`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Composition/Variant9c3c462f688028108bd308b056abddb0846a0245fbc2a9201e89b0bfe3ca3d58.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Composition/Variant9c3c462f688028108bd308b056abddb0846a0245fbc2a9201e89b0bfe3ca3d58.lean#L987).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `569cab6e7c28dddff033f8155e85f71b712e2a62` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
