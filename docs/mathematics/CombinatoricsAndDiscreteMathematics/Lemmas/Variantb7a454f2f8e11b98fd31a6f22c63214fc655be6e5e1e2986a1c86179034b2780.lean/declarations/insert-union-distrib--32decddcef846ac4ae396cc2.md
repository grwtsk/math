## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:85ca4d33-ced4-21f5-2415-eb6854fc2370`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 83–92.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem insert_union_distrib (a : α) (s t : Finset α) :
    insert a (s ∪ t) = insert a s ∪ insert a t := by
  simp only [insert_union, union_insert, insert_idem]

/-- To prove a relation on pairs of `Finset X`, it suffices to show that it is
  * symmetric,
  * it holds when one of the `Finset`s is empty,
  * it holds for pairs of singletons,
  * if it holds for `[a, c]` and for `[b, c]`, then it holds for `[a ∪ b, c]`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Lemmas/Variantb7a454f2f8e11b98fd31a6f22c63214fc655be6e5e1e2986a1c86179034b2780.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Lemmas/Variantb7a454f2f8e11b98fd31a6f22c63214fc655be6e5e1e2986a1c86179034b2780.lean#L83).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5a471fa3bb5c713a0f88a68fe44046c75eb5829c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
