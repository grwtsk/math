## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d0fa1a64-9020-4970-7471-f0d2342d5f32`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 728–750.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem prod_take_ofFn {n : ℕ} (f : Fin n → M) (i : ℕ) :
    ((ofFn f).take i).prod = ∏ j with j.val < i, f j := by

  | zero =>
    simp
  | succ i IH =>
    by_cases h : i < n
    · have : i < length (ofFn f) := by rwa [length_ofFn]
      rw [prod_take_succ _ _ this]
      have A : ({j | j.val < i + 1} : Finset (Fin n)) =
          insert ⟨i, h⟩ ({j | Fin.val j < i} : Finset (Fin n)) := by grind

        rw [← length_ofFn (f := f)] at h
        have : length (ofFn f) ≤ i := not_lt.mp h
        rw [take_of_length_le this, take_of_length_le (le_trans this (Nat.le_succ _))]
      have B : ∀ j : Fin n, ((j : ℕ) < i.succ) = ((j : ℕ) < i) := by
        intro j
        have : (j : ℕ) < i := lt_of_lt_of_le j.2 (not_lt.mp h)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Fin/Variant798914333dd97eada9032afc50a9106cc5cf481b57477c4a6f198220ffd17304.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Fin/Variant798914333dd97eada9032afc50a9106cc5cf481b57477c4a6f198220ffd17304.lean#L728).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0925d3fd11f19650de9a7f095870f5d1382ff44a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
