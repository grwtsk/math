## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:83bf0e1b-8f19-b349-36a9-68ede804bb22`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–98.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem RegistryCouplingWeightState.row_normalized
    {registry : WorldModelRegistry}
    {region : ActiveModelRegion registry}
    (state : RegistryCouplingWeightState registry region)
    (i : registry.ModelId)
    (active : i ∈ region.activeModels) :
    ∑ j ∈ region.activeModels, state.weights.weight i j = 1 := by
  rw [← state.exactActiveModels] at active ⊢
  exact state.weights.normalized i active

/-- A raw weight table has no admissibility or authority fields. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Coupling/Variant7905080ebdaf687162f5273c7f4d83bbf1e2fd72bdcf6dbc3374b54d96a35fe2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Coupling/Variant7905080ebdaf687162f5273c7f4d83bbf1e2fd72bdcf6dbc3374b54d96a35fe2.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5a299685ac41e75d56f3163c9aeb93e987389058` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
