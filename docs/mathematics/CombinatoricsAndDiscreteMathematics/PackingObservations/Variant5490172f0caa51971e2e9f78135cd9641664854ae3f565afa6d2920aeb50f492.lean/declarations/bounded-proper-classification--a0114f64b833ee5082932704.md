## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c2a3f09-6bd5-2bca-fe5f-ba1f5789444f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 357–374.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    have htwo : 2 ≤ (n + h).toNat := by omega
    have hupper : (n + h).toNat ≤ P.X := Int.toNat_le.mpr hrange.2
    apply FactorState.prime_of_exhausted_horizon htwo hupper
    intro p hp hbound hdiv
    exact (hs.2.resolve_left hdepth) p (hbound.trans hcover) hp h hh hdiv
  · rintro ⟨hrange, hprime⟩
    exact proper_preserves_primes P n hrange hprime

/-- Raw survival at an exhausted horizon still implies primality. It is the
converse, hence complete raw classification, that fails on visible primes. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/PackingObservations/Variant5490172f0caa51971e2e9f78135cd9641664854ae3f565afa6d2920aeb50f492.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/PackingObservations/Variant5490172f0caa51971e2e9f78135cd9641664854ae3f565afa6d2920aeb50f492.lean#L357).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1e916e8853ecd803d63096c8fe933390d74b6ab9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
