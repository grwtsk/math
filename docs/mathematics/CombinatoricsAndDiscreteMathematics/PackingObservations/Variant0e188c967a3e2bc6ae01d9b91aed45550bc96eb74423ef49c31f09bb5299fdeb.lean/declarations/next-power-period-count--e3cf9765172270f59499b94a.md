## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6e7bc1cc-87fd-cae4-e9ee-76516a21dc49`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 291–296.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem next_power_period_count (p k : ℕ) (hp : p.Prime) :
    ((Finset.Ioc 0 (p ^ (k + 1))).filter fun n => p ^ (k + 1) ∣ n).card = 1 := by
  rw [Nat.Ioc_filter_dvd_card_eq_div, Nat.div_self (pow_pos hp.pos _)]

/-- The valuation shell is the difference of nested divisibility cells, so its
coordinates are not treated as independent observations. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/PackingObservations/Variant0e188c967a3e2bc6ae01d9b91aed45550bc96eb74423ef49c31f09bb5299fdeb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/PackingObservations/Variant0e188c967a3e2bc6ae01d9b91aed45550bc96eb74423ef49c31f09bb5299fdeb.lean#L291).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8951a5a0ae8990bc7a8ad2cf9f96ac8525e8df8f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
