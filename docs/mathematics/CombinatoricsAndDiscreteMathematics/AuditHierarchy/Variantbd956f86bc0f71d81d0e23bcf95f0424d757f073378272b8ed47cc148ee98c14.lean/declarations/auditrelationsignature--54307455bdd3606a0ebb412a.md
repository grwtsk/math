## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d40627577ea93103ae7439545f97f8fe8e15b576950ebf5a9eb538e6a51a9419`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 167–182.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def auditRelationSignature : StructuralSignature where
  SortType := AuditNodeClass
  Relation := AuditRelationKind
  sortFintype := inferInstance
  sortDecidableEq := inferInstance
  relationFintype := inferInstance
  relationDecidableEq := inferInstance
  arity := fun _ ↦ 2
  version := 1

/--
The polyhierarchical ledger reuses `PolyHierarchy` directly.  Its element
carrier is related to the canonical node carrier only by an explicit
equivalence, and every admitted binary fact is checked against the fixed
domain/codomain table.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/AuditHierarchy/Variantbd956f86bc0f71d81d0e23bcf95f0424d757f073378272b8ed47cc148ee98c14.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/AuditHierarchy/Variantbd956f86bc0f71d81d0e23bcf95f0424d757f073378272b8ed47cc148ee98c14.lean#L167).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1a351c17d90040f2cc4151f2a6be14bec6885fac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
