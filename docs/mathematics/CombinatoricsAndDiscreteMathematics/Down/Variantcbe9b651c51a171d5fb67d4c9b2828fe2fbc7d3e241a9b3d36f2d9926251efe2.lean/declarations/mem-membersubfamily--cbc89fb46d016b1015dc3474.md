## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9e849fa8-cd26-9ccb-a0e8-a4ac99219402`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 64–70.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_memberSubfamily : s ∈ 𝒜.memberSubfamily a ↔ insert a s ∈ 𝒜 ∧ a ∉ s := by
  simp_rw [memberSubfamily, mem_image, mem_filter]
  refine ⟨?_, fun h => ⟨insert a s, ⟨h.1, by simp⟩, erase_insert h.2⟩⟩
  rintro ⟨s, ⟨hs1, hs2⟩, rfl⟩
  rw [insert_erase hs2]
  exact ⟨hs1, notMem_erase _ _⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Down/Variantcbe9b651c51a171d5fb67d4c9b2828fe2fbc7d3e241a9b3d36f2d9926251efe2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Down/Variantcbe9b651c51a171d5fb67d4c9b2828fe2fbc7d3e241a9b3d36f2d9926251efe2.lean#L64).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
