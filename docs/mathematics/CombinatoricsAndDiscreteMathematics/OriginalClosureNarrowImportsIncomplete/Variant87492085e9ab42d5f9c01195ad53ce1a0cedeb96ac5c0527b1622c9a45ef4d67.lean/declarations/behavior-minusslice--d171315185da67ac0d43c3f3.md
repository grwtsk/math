## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bafc4104-85e4-d65b-6ce6-7a317a9382a3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 6525–6540.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] theorem behavior_minusSlice (x : Minus Q V B O) (a : Frame Q V (Plus Q V B O)) :
    behavior Q V B O (minusSlice x a) = (behavior Q V B O x).slice a := (slice_range x a).choose_spec

end FreeObservations

end PureTypeSystem

/-! Prefix observation spaces in the all-path plain construction.
Unrolling the exit spaces gives a single table of base observations.
Only domain feedback needs to be well founded; continuing paths themselves
may have arbitrary length and cycles. The required well-foundedness follows
from profile components and the syntax potential. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OriginalClosureNarrowImportsIncomplete/Variant87492085e9ab42d5f9c01195ad53ce1a0cedeb96ac5c0527b1622c9a45ef4d67.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OriginalClosureNarrowImportsIncomplete/Variant87492085e9ab42d5f9c01195ad53ce1a0cedeb96ac5c0527b1622c9a45ef4d67.lean#L6525).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c43dd61c35d3d36651c01f53530ca36ac91fcb76` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
