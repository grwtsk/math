## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9976e357-58da-a318-d677-ba0dc9086204`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 53–64.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (∫ s in node A j..node A (j + 1),
      kapitzaWeight A s * frozenState A (j + 1) s) =
      correctedEnergy A j (node A j) - correctedEnergy A j (node A (j + 1)) +
        ∫ s in node A j..node A (j + 1), smoothBalance A (j + 1) s := by
  have hc := frozen_cell_balance A (j + 1) (node A j) (node A (j + 1)) hA
  have hm : min (j + 1) (cutoff A) = j + 1 := min_eq_left (by omega)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/SourceStorageDescent/Variant4fc5ff34a9a4542255106800cd5622bf1f939be2a7da10c992c89c80b3fcd24b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/SourceStorageDescent/Variant4fc5ff34a9a4542255106800cd5622bf1f939be2a7da10c992c89c80b3fcd24b.lean#L53).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f90b39b5be37527e38eb4be69fe78258b705c1bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
