## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:46570488-2b45-6d60-a7c6-96f6994901bb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 84–106.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem terminalGauge_eq_events (A : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    blockGauge A (cutoff A) = totalEventWork A + totalQuadraticWork A := by
  have hc := nonaffineWork_corrected_terminal A hA
  have hn : 1 ≤ cutoff A := by
    unfold cutoff
    exact (Nat.one_le_floor_iff _).mpr (Real.one_le_exp (by linarith))
  have hi : localEnergy A 0 (node A 0) = sourceStorage A 0 := by
    rw [node_zero A (by linarith)]
    unfold localEnergy
    rw [min_eq_left hn]
    exact frozenEnergy_initial A
  have he : localEnergy A (cutoff A) (node A (cutoff A)) = 0 := by
    rw [node_cutoff A (by linarith)]
    unfold localEnergy
    rw [min_eq_right (Nat.le_succ _)]
    exact frozenEnergy_terminal A
  have hb : blockGauge A 0 = 0 := by simp [blockGauge]
  unfold correctedEnergy at hc
  rw [hi, he, hb] at hc
  have hc' := nonaffineWork_complete_balance A hA
  linarith only [hc, hc']

/-- The actual terminal expression includes the transported initial energy and all remainders. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/SourceStorageDescent/Variant4fc5ff34a9a4542255106800cd5622bf1f939be2a7da10c992c89c80b3fcd24b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/SourceStorageDescent/Variant4fc5ff34a9a4542255106800cd5622bf1f939be2a7da10c992c89c80b3fcd24b.lean#L84).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f90b39b5be37527e38eb4be69fe78258b705c1bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
