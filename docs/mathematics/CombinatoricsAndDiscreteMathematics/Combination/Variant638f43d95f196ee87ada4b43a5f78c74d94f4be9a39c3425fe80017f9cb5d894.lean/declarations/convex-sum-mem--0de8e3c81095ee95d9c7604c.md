## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eb830ea1-9cae-92e4-eb96-4db20ba9c8a8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 187–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem Convex.sum_mem (hs : Convex R s) (h₀ : ∀ i ∈ t, 0 ≤ w i) (h₁ : ∑ i ∈ t, w i = 1)
    (hz : ∀ i ∈ t, z i ∈ s) : (∑ i ∈ t, w i • z i) ∈ s := by
  simpa only [h₁, centerMass, inv_one, one_smul] using

/-- A version of `Convex.sum_mem` for `finsum`s. If `s` is a convex set, `w : ι → R` is a family of
nonnegative weights with sum one and `z : ι → E` is a family of elements of a module over `R` such
that `z i ∈ s` whenever `w i ≠ 0`, then the sum `∑ᶠ i, w i • z i` belongs to `s`. See also
`PartitionOfUnity.finsum_smul_mem_convex`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Combination/Variant638f43d95f196ee87ada4b43a5f78c74d94f4be9a39c3425fe80017f9cb5d894.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Combination/Variant638f43d95f196ee87ada4b43a5f78c74d94f4be9a39c3425fe80017f9cb5d894.lean#L187).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7b545e4be70920659c08118cd45bade7baf94040` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
