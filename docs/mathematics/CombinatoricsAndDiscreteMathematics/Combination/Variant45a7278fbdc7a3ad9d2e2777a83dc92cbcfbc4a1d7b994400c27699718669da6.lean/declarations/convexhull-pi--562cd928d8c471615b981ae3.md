## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:98546c3c-57b2-6796-7cff-7dd78f8f0a48`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 606–611.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma convexHull_pi (s : Set ι) (t : Π i, Set (E i)) :
    convexHull 𝕜 (s.pi t) = s.pi (fun i ↦ convexHull 𝕜 (t i)) :=
  Set.Subset.antisymm (convexHull_min (Set.pi_mono fun _ _ ↦ subset_convexHull _ _) <| convex_pi <|
    fun _ _ ↦ convex_convexHull _ _) fun _ ↦ mem_convexHull_pi

end pi
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Combination/Variant45a7278fbdc7a3ad9d2e2777a83dc92cbcfbc4a1d7b994400c27699718669da6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Combination/Variant45a7278fbdc7a3ad9d2e2777a83dc92cbcfbc4a1d7b994400c27699718669da6.lean#L606).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `13417157804ac6de98e3dfaa75fd57cfc4acf27c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
