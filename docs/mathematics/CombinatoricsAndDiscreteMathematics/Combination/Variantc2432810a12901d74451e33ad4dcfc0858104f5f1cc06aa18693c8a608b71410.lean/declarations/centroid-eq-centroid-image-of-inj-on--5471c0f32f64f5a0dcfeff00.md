## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b0641152-1b36-54e0-e370-b553204e0c1e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 954–983.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (hi : ∀ (i) (_ : i ∈ s) (j) (_ : j ∈ s), p i = p j → i = j) {ps : Set P} [Fintype ps]

  let f : p '' ↑s → ι := fun x => x.property.choose
  have hf : ∀ x, f x ∈ s ∧ p (f x) = x := fun x => x.property.choose_spec
  let f' : ps → ι := fun x => f ⟨x, hps ▸ x.property⟩

/-- Two indexed families of points that are injective on the given
`Finset`s and with the same points in the image of those `Finset`s
have the same centroid. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Combination/Variantc2432810a12901d74451e33ad4dcfc0858104f5f1cc06aa18693c8a608b71410.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Combination/Variantc2432810a12901d74451e33ad4dcfc0858104f5f1cc06aa18693c8a608b71410.lean#L954).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a6ac907ae6e17699091ab4d76849afd971415f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
