## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ed51fed6-4260-5fb0-11a5-0a18f8c3f519`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 192–204.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem card_effectiveStates_le_domain
    (Q : Quantizer Cfg m n)
    [Fintype Cfg] :
    Q.effectiveStates.card ≤ Fintype.card Cfg := by
  simpa [effectiveStates] using
    (Finset.card_image_le (s := Finset.univ) (f := Q.encode))

/--
An `m × n` one-bit matrix has exactly `2 ^ (m * n)` possible values.

This also covers zero rows or zero columns: there is exactly one function from
an empty index type, matching `2 ^ 0 = 1`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Core/Variantf631936cfe4add0edc20debbd79b1d2944f553445c1ea79938cb73033e9fe0d6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Core/Variantf631936cfe4add0edc20debbd79b1d2944f553445c1ea79938cb73033e9fe0d6.lean#L192).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a651c3858c2f2019d411e1408ad70b95976d9735` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
