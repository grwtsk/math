## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d888e9b9-35a1-ae6f-d8e9-76f96011a198`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 382–391.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem collinear_singleton (p : P) : Collinear k ({p} : Set P) := by
  rw [collinear_iff_rank_le_one, vectorSpan_singleton]
  simp
#align collinear_singleton collinear_singleton

variable {k}

/-- Given a point `p₀` in a set of points, that set is collinear if and
only if the points can all be expressed as multiples of the same
vector, added to `p₀`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/FiniteDimensional/Variant0286148f68a9896cd37b66075980a2ed6a466be20468db6389ee9e73b72a7fe5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/FiniteDimensional/Variant0286148f68a9896cd37b66075980a2ed6a466be20468db6389ee9e73b72a7fe5.lean#L382).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e0f18d1f383311dc12e2e8cb4df73b6dc44ec2a4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
