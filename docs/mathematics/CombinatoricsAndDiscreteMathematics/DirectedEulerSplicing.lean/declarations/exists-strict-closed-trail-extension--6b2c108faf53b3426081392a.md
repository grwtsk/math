## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9fc5beea-dfbe-1826-8fac-a5b2cca05537`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 117–133.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_strict_closed_trail_extension
    (p : Walk tail head a b) (loop : Walk tail head b b) (q : Walk tail head b a)
    (hold : (p.append q).edges.Nodup) (hloop : loop.edges.Nodup)
    (hdisjoint : List.Disjoint (p.append q).edges loop.edges)
    (hne : loop.edges ≠ []) :
    ∃ r : Walk tail head a a,
      r.edges.Nodup ∧
      (r.edges : Multiset E) =
        ((p.append q).edges : Multiset E) + (loop.edges : Multiset E) ∧
      (p.append q).edges.length < r.edges.length := by
  refine ⟨p.splice loop q, splice_nodup p loop q hold hloop hdisjoint,
    splice_edges_multiset p loop q, ?_⟩
  rw [splice_length]
  have hpos : 0 < loop.edges.length := List.length_pos_iff_ne_nil.mpr hne

/-- The directed incidence telescopes to the two exact walk endpoints. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/DirectedEulerSplicing.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Combinatorics/DirectedEulerSplicing.lean#L117).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e4e189af2f8c7cd3ac4ae02c0ac6d1e6de3852bd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
