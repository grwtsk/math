## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:04ec7e44-61a8-2006-5e0a-eb638079bed9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 173–178.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma expect_ite_mem (s t : Finset ι) (f : ι → M) :
    𝔼 i ∈ s, (if i ∈ t then f i else 0) = (#(s ∩ t) / #s : ℚ≥0) • 𝔼 i ∈ s ∩ t, f i := by
  obtain hst | hst := (s ∩ t).eq_empty_or_nonempty
  · simp [expect, hst]
  · simp [expect, smul_smul, ← inv_mul_eq_div, hst.card_ne_zero]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Expect/Variantc144abd68a776d9ce69c4b39a76e1dcdba3a78aa1b76f89ecaf113a1b4efe70e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Expect/Variantc144abd68a776d9ce69c4b39a76e1dcdba3a78aa1b76f89ecaf113a1b4efe70e.lean#L173).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `43b483189b452c445b957498d978c55b3cccf308` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
