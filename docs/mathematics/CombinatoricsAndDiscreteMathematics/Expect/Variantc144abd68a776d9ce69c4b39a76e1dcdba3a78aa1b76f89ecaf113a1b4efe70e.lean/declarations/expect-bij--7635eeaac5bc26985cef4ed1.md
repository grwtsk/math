## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a5a163c1-d658-9d4e-46e9-63b681663b4f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 219–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma expect_bij' (i : ∀ a ∈ s, κ) (j : ∀ a ∈ t, ι) (hi : ∀ a ha, i a ha ∈ t)
    (hj : ∀ a ha, j a ha ∈ s) (left_inv : ∀ a ha, j (i a ha) (hi a ha) = a)
    (right_inv : ∀ a ha, i (j a ha) (hj a ha) = a) (h : ∀ a ha, f a = g (i a ha)) :
    𝔼 i ∈ s, f i = 𝔼 i ∈ t, g i := by
  simp_rw [expect, card_bij' i j hi hj left_inv right_inv, sum_bij' i j hi hj left_inv right_inv h]

/-- Reorder an average.

The difference with `Finset.expect_nbij'` is that the bijection is specified as a surjective
injection, rather than by an inverse function.

The difference with `Finset.expect_bij` is that the bijection is a non-dependent function, rather
than being allowed to use membership of the domain of the average. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Expect/Variantc144abd68a776d9ce69c4b39a76e1dcdba3a78aa1b76f89ecaf113a1b4efe70e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Expect/Variantc144abd68a776d9ce69c4b39a76e1dcdba3a78aa1b76f89ecaf113a1b4efe70e.lean#L219).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `43b483189b452c445b957498d978c55b3cccf308` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
