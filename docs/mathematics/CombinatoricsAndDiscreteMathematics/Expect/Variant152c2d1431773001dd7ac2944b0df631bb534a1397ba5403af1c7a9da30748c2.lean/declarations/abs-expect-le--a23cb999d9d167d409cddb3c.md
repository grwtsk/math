## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7ae9723d-0b29-b04c-fa5a-fdaa94efe510`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma abs_expect_le (s : Finset ι) (f : ι → α) : |𝔼 i ∈ s, f i| ≤ 𝔼 i ∈ s, |f i| :=
  le_expect_of_subadditive abs_zero abs_add (fun _ ↦ abs_nnqsmul _)

variable [CommSemiring R] [LinearOrder R] [IsStrictOrderedRing R] [ExistsAddOfLE R] [Module ℚ≥0 R]
  [PosSMulMono ℚ≥0 R]

/-- **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality** in terms of `Finset.expect`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Expect/Variant152c2d1431773001dd7ac2944b0df631bb534a1397ba5403af1c7a9da30748c2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Expect/Variant152c2d1431773001dd7ac2944b0df631bb534a1397ba5403af1c7a9da30748c2.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f396a65996aaa209fcaf3b6bd67a156695628622` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
