## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3537e120-588e-9ffd-8ff8-43b744720495`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 562–571.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma contract_delete_comm (M : Matroid α) (hCD : Disjoint C D) : M ／ C ＼ D = M ＼ D ／ C := by
  wlog hCE : C ⊆ M.E generalizing C with aux
  · rw [← contract_inter_ground_eq, aux (hCD.mono_left inter_subset_left) inter_subset_right,
      contract_eq_contract_iff, inter_assoc, delete_ground,
      inter_eq_self_of_subset_right sdiff_subset]
  rw [delete_eq_restrict, delete_eq_restrict, contract_ground, sdiff_sdiff_comm,
    restrict_contract_eq_contract_restrict _ (by simpa [hCE, subset_sdiff])]

/-- A version of `contract_delete_comm` without the disjointness hypothesis,
and hence a less simple RHS. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Contract/Variant40ad26a8af473143563e6b1351e054f542f6fdd7d6f1873734eb7851fd9e42d8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Contract/Variant40ad26a8af473143563e6b1351e054f542f6fdd7d6f1873734eb7851fd9e42d8.lean#L562).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5cf243172922d9312efb2df3db6e4286acb35f8a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
