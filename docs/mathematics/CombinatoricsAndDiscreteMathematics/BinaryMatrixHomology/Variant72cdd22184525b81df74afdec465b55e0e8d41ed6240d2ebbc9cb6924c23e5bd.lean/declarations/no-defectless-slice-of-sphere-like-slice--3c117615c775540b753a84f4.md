## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b156dbdc-908b-4bed-7dd7-46d0e30d3059`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 515–542.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem no_defectless_slice_of_sphere_like_slice
    (D : DirectionalBinaryCellFlow)
    (t0 : D.base.Time)
    (S0 : SphereLikeClosure (D.base.complex t0))
    (t : D.base.Time) :
    ¬ (D.poincare_hopf t).defects.Defectless := by
  intro h0

  have hidx :
      (D.poincare_hopf t).defects.totalIndex = 2 :=
    D.total_defect_index_eq_two_of_sphere_like_slice t0 S0 t

  have hbad : (0 : ℤ) = 2 := by
    calc
      (0 : ℤ) = (D.poincare_hopf t).defects.totalIndex := h0.symm
      _ = 2 := hidx

  norm_num at hbad

end DirectionalBinaryCellFlow

/--
Matrix-only adapter for a homology-preserving directional flow.

The semantic directional-flow and defect-index data remain as boundary facts;
the internal proof evolution is represented by a matrix theorem and a temporal
`BinaryMatrixStream`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/BinaryMatrixHomology/Variant72cdd22184525b81df74afdec465b55e0e8d41ed6240d2ebbc9cb6924c23e5bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/BinaryMatrixHomology/Variant72cdd22184525b81df74afdec465b55e0e8d41ed6240d2ebbc9cb6924c23e5bd.lean#L515).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cd30f5817ecf77000f4beb83322433840ed75a49` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
