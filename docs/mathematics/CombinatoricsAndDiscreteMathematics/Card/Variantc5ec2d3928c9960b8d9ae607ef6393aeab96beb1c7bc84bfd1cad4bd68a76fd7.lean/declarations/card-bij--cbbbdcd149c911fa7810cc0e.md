## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:099a393d-07e6-3aa8-5266-fe7df1963c60`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 352–365.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (hj : ∀ a ha, j a ha ∈ s) (left_inv : ∀ a ha, j (i a ha) (hi a ha) = a)
    (right_inv : ∀ a ha, i (j a ha) (hj a ha) = a) : #s = #t := by
  refine card_bij i hi (fun a1 h1 a2 h2 eq ↦ ?_) (fun b hb ↦ ⟨_, hj b hb, right_inv b hb⟩)

/-- Reorder a finset.

The difference with `Finset.card_nbij'` is that the bijection is specified as a surjective
injection, rather than by an inverse function.

The difference with `Finset.card_bij` is that the bijection is a non-dependent function, rather than
being allowed to use membership of the domain. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Card/Variantc5ec2d3928c9960b8d9ae607ef6393aeab96beb1c7bc84bfd1cad4bd68a76fd7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Card/Variantc5ec2d3928c9960b8d9ae607ef6393aeab96beb1c7bc84bfd1cad4bd68a76fd7.lean#L352).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1f5397a36acf986959491a4595020e8e76e9faa7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
