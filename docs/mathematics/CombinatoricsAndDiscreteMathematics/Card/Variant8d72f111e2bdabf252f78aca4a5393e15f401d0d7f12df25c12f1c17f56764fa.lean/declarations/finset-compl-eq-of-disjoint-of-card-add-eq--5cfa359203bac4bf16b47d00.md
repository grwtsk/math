## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:20e0faa3-e289-5440-bc2d-f325a4dd484a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 156–163.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Finset.compl_eq_of_disjoint_of_card_add_eq
    {ι : Type*} [DecidableEq ι] [Fintype ι] {S₁ S₂ : Finset ι} (h : Disjoint S₁ S₂)
    (h' : S₁.card + S₂.card = Finset.card (.univ : Finset ι)) :
    S₁ᶜ = S₂ :=
  (Finset.eq_of_subset_of_card_le
    (by rwa [Finset.subset_compl_iff_disjoint_left])
    (by simp [← Nat.add_le_add_iff_left (n := S₁.card), h'])).symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Card/Variant8d72f111e2bdabf252f78aca4a5393e15f401d0d7f12df25c12f1c17f56764fa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Card/Variant8d72f111e2bdabf252f78aca4a5393e15f401d0d7f12df25c12f1c17f56764fa.lean#L156).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `25dd6a9c5ae1e0898c9eec35b75d1eacd0e924f7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
