## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `syntax` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a134b29f0dcd75b93d3219a93dd646157493a94541fa715c274636b4d21779ab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 189–203.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
syntax (name := bigsum) "∑ " bigOpBinders BigOpWith ? ", " term:67 : term

/--
- `∏ x, f x` is notation for `Finset.prod Finset.univ f`. It is the product of `f x`,
  where `x` ranges over the finite domain of `f`.
- `∏ x ∈ s, f x` is notation for `Finset.prod s f`. It is the product of `f x`,
  where `x` ranges over the finite set `s` (either a `Finset` or a `Set` with a `Fintype` instance).
- `∏ x ∈ s with p x, f x` is notation for `Finset.prod (Finset.filter p s) f`.
- `∏ x ∈ s with h : p x, f x h` is notation for
  `Finset.prod s fun x ↦ if h : p x then f x h else 1`.
- `∏ (x ∈ s) (y ∈ t), f x y` is notation for `Finset.prod (s ×ˢ t) (fun ⟨x, y⟩ ↦ f x y)`.

These support destructuring, for example `∏ ⟨x, y⟩ ∈ s ×ˢ t, f x y`.

Notation: `"∏" bigOpBinders* ("with" (ident ":")? term)? "," term` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Defs/Variant2ae7add11e8d9e107739f4b1038ceb977e5ba4034fcfd97ecd9da4709dffa139.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Defs/Variant2ae7add11e8d9e107739f4b1038ceb977e5ba4034fcfd97ecd9da4709dffa139.lean#L189).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `84e7a40cd644c362ba59f96b27ad46569ac92471` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
