## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b3a07d1abc45a56643634b60e5a06565fdee7fc29a0083dc8dc59cb9c3511a1b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 312–317.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance decidableEqPiMultiset {β : α → Type*} [∀ a, DecidableEq (β a)] :
    DecidableEq (∀ a ∈ m, β a) := fun f g =>
  decidable_of_iff (∀ (a) (h : a ∈ m), f a h = g a h) (by simp [funext_iff])

/-- If `p` is a decidable predicate,
so is the existence of an element in a multiset satisfying `p`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Defs/Variant5c319c3c9f5bf422c3b0a1a93ad5d951c9b5c8afafdcfb100ded04f1778478cb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Defs/Variant5c319c3c9f5bf422c3b0a1a93ad5d951c9b5c8afafdcfb100ded04f1778478cb.lean#L312).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aacaf51398dbd77d6d2aa77a6ed2a09b49c44287` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
