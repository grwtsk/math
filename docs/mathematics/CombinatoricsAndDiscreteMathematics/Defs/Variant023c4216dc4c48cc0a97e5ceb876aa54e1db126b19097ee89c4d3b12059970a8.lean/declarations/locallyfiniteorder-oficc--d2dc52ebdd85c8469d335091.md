## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b459b235fb0cf916b5560e4c51965493214d8c15c62f1bf053351b4696c6adf6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 190–209.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def LocallyFiniteOrder.ofIcc (α : Type*) [PartialOrder α] [DecidableEq α]
    (finsetIcc : α → α → Finset α) (mem_Icc : ∀ a b x, x ∈ finsetIcc a b ↔ a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b) :
    LocallyFiniteOrder α where
  finsetIcc := finsetIcc
  finsetIco a b := {x ∈ finsetIcc a b | x ≠ b}
  finsetIoc a b := {x ∈ finsetIcc a b | a ≠ x}
  finsetIoo a b := {x ∈ finsetIcc a b | a ≠ x ∧ x ≠ b}
  finset_mem_Icc := mem_Icc
  finset_mem_Ico a b x := by rw [Finset.mem_filter, mem_Icc, and_assoc, lt_iff_le_and_ne]
  finset_mem_Ioc a b x := by rw [Finset.mem_filter, mem_Icc, and_right_comm, lt_iff_le_and_ne]
  finset_mem_Ioo a b x := by
    rw [Finset.mem_filter, mem_Icc, and_and_and_comm, lt_iff_le_and_ne, lt_iff_le_and_ne]

only `Preorder`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Defs/Variant023c4216dc4c48cc0a97e5ceb876aa54e1db126b19097ee89c4d3b12059970a8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Defs/Variant023c4216dc4c48cc0a97e5ceb876aa54e1db126b19097ee89c4d3b12059970a8.lean#L190).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `03a818648aa0d0ccc34298eb6f43d86e40412050` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
