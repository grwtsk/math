## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8c2fef0c-2015-d2d0-9e23-3a6284318a5c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 114–124.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem weighted_residual_sum (w : FiniteFibreWeights B I)
    (f : ∀ b, I b → ℝ) (b : B) :
    ∑ i, w.weight b i * (f b i - w.mean f b) = 0 := by
  simp_rw [mul_sub]
  rw [Finset.sum_sub_distrib, ← Finset.sum_mul]
  change (∑ i, w.weight b i * f b i) - w.mass b * w.mean f b = 0
  rw [w.mass_mul_mean, sub_self]

variable [Fintype B]

/-- The actual finite weighted bilinear form. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/PositiveAtlas/Variant67daff1f866eec17c624ef1cccfd28a72c9192d1a669662e0c4af502f3e4fa4c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/PositiveAtlas/Variant67daff1f866eec17c624ef1cccfd28a72c9192d1a669662e0c4af502f3e4fa4c.lean#L114).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `748d4cc6f7b1c13d1098a9558b6111f6df22496c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
