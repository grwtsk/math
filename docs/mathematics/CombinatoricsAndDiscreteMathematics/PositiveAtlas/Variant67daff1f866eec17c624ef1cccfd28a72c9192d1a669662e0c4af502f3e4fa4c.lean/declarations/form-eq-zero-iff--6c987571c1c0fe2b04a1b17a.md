## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:83282a34-2d10-8972-dab1-d11e4609fe3f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 182–196.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem form_eq_zero_iff (w : FiniteFibreWeights B I) (f : ∀ b, I b → ℝ) :
    w.positiveForm.form f f = 0 ↔ f = 0 := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    have term_nonneg : ∀ b i, 0 ≤ w.weight b i * (f b i * f b i) :=
      fun b i => mul_nonneg (le_of_lt (w.positive b i)) (mul_self_nonneg _)
    have hb := (Finset.sum_eq_zero_iff_of_nonneg (fun b _ =>
      Finset.sum_nonneg (fun i _ => term_nonneg b i))).mp h
    funext b i
    have hi := (Finset.sum_eq_zero_iff_of_nonneg (fun i _ => term_nonneg b i)).mp
      (hb b (Finset.mem_univ b)) i (Finset.mem_univ i)
    have hs := (mul_eq_zero.mp hi).resolve_left (ne_of_gt (w.positive b i))
    exact mul_self_eq_zero.mp hs
  · intro h; subst f; simp [positiveForm]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/PositiveAtlas/Variant67daff1f866eec17c624ef1cccfd28a72c9192d1a669662e0c4af502f3e4fa4c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/PositiveAtlas/Variant67daff1f866eec17c624ef1cccfd28a72c9192d1a669662e0c4af502f3e4fa4c.lean#L182).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `748d4cc6f7b1c13d1098a9558b6111f6df22496c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
