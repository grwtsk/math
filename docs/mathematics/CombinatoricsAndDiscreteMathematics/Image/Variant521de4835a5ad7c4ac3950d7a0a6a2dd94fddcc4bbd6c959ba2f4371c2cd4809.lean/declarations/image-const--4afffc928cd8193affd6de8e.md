## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cad28def-d7cb-aea2-db8e-6006da489991`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 622–628.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem image_const {s : Finset α} (h : s.Nonempty) (b : β) : (s.image fun _ => b) = singleton b :=
  ext fun b' => by
    simp only [mem_image, exists_prop, exists_and_right, h.bex, true_and_iff, mem_singleton,
      eq_comm]
#align finset.image_const Finset.image_const

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Image/Variant521de4835a5ad7c4ac3950d7a0a6a2dd94fddcc4bbd6c959ba2f4371c2cd4809.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Image/Variant521de4835a5ad7c4ac3950d7a0a6a2dd94fddcc4bbd6c959ba2f4371c2cd4809.lean#L622).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `afa5c6c1770d50e9ed5fbc757f64ba337bac65cf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
