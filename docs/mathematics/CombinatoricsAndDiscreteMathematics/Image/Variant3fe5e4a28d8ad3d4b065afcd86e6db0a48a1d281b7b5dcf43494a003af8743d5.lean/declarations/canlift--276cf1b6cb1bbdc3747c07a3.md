## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6bb9af763d7bdd9b37dddbd16e17c69c7c67a1af2f27d3bd2641cf4f92c80590`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 351–358.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance canLift (c) (p) [CanLift β α c p] :
    CanLift (Finset β) (Finset α) (image c) fun s => ∀ x ∈ s, p x where
  prf := by
    rintro ⟨⟨l⟩, hd : l.Nodup⟩ hl
    lift l to List α using hl
    exact ⟨⟨l, hd.of_map _⟩, ext fun a => by simp⟩
#align finset.can_lift Finset.canLift

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Image/Variant3fe5e4a28d8ad3d4b065afcd86e6db0a48a1d281b7b5dcf43494a003af8743d5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Image/Variant3fe5e4a28d8ad3d4b065afcd86e6db0a48a1d281b7b5dcf43494a003af8743d5.lean#L351).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2fd816d6d4b61a12140986f93f2c2757d398e914` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
