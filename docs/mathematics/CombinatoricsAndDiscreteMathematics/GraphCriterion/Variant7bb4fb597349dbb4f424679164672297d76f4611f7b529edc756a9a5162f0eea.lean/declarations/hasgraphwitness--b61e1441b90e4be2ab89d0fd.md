## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:71e9b1ba9ada20e9155fe989a628459661d8af7e1ae40130ade40432ff99d455`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 56–63.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def HasGraphWitness (Lat : Type) [Lattice Lat] [OrderBot Lat] : Prop :=
  ∃ size : ℕ, 0 < size ∧ ∃ color : Fin size → Fin size → Lat, IsGraphWitness color

section PrincipalColors

variable {Lat Carrier : Type} [Lattice Lat] [OrderBot Lat] {alg : Algebra Carrier}

/-- Color a pair by its principal congruence, transported to the lattice. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphCriterion/Variant7bb4fb597349dbb4f424679164672297d76f4611f7b529edc756a9a5162f0eea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphCriterion/Variant7bb4fb597349dbb4f424679164672297d76f4611f7b529edc756a9a5162f0eea.lean#L56).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `387da74301a6d0c732da87a655888df988a3ad22` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
