## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:520ae1ad-aa75-95f4-c98b-bef838fb0b72`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–102.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem principalColor_triangle (equiv : Lat ≃o Congruence alg) (left right middle : Carrier) :
    principalColor equiv left right ≤
      principalColor equiv left middle ⊔ principalColor equiv middle right := by
  apply (principalColor_le equiv).mpr
  apply (equiv _).trans
  · exact (principalColor_le equiv).mp le_sup_left
  · exact (principalColor_le equiv).mp le_sup_right

omit [OrderBot Lat] in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphCriterion/Variant32e0fd996c32a104361a8f7f8598eaec2651634eb956f201d8bf61afc17abfca.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/GraphCriterion/Variant32e0fd996c32a104361a8f7f8598eaec2651634eb956f201d8bf61afc17abfca.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5a3f88c40aabd2a78eb5cff68d155bf1d6fe3648` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
