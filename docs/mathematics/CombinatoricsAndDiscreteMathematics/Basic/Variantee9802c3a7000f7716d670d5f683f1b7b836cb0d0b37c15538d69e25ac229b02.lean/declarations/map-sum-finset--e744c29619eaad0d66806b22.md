## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3fd02b8a-bbd5-6027-2814-b15cfbdd03f2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 607–613.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_sum_finset [DecidableEq ι] [Fintype ι] :
    (f fun i => ∑ j ∈ A i, g i j) = ∑ r ∈ piFinset A, f fun i => g i (r i) :=
  f.map_sum_finset_aux _ _ rfl

/-- If `f` is multilinear, then `f (Σ_{j₁} g₁ j₁, ..., Σ_{jₙ} gₙ jₙ)` is the sum of
`f (g₁ (r 1), ..., gₙ (r n))` where `r` ranges over all functions `r`. This follows from
multilinearity by expanding successively with respect to each coordinate. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variantee9802c3a7000f7716d670d5f683f1b7b836cb0d0b37c15538d69e25ac229b02.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variantee9802c3a7000f7716d670d5f683f1b7b836cb0d0b37c15538d69e25ac229b02.lean#L607).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `59ca40d74cc428dda0374c2a4e15d58072dcc5e4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
