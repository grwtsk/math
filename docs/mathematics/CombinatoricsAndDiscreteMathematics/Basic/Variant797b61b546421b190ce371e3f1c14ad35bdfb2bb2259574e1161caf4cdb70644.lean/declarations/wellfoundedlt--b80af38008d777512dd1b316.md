## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:74ca3d5780d71279dea0be3d27f860ddfc6f29a806a5d0bf5df33464d4abcc49`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 454–466.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance wellFoundedLT : WellFoundedLT (Finset α) :=
  Finset.isWellFounded_ssubset
#align finset.is_well_founded_lt Finset.wellFoundedLT

end Subset

-- TODO: these should be global attributes, but this will require fixing other files
attribute [local trans] Subset.trans Superset.trans

/-! ### Order embedding from `Finset α` to `Set α` -/


/-- Coercion to `Set α` as an `OrderEmbedding`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variant797b61b546421b190ce371e3f1c14ad35bdfb2bb2259574e1161caf4cdb70644.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variant797b61b546421b190ce371e3f1c14ad35bdfb2bb2259574e1161caf4cdb70644.lean#L454).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b60684812356eac00940fb922aa14757ea39b085` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
