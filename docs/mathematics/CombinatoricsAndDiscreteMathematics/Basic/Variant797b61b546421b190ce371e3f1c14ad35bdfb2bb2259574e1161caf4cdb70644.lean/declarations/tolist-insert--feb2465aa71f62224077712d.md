## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:01b6aeec-51da-fae1-9972-c7aac5d8a9ed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 3450–3471.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem toList_insert [DecidableEq α] {a : α} {s : Finset α} (h : a ∉ s) :
    (insert a s).toList ~ a :: s.toList :=
  cons_eq_insert _ _ h ▸ toList_cons _
#align finset.to_list_insert Finset.toList_insert

end ToList

### disjiUnion

This section is about the bounded union of a disjoint indexed family `t : α → Finset β` of finite
sets over a finite set `s : Finset α`. In most cases `Finset.biUnion` should be preferred.

section DisjiUnion

variable {s s₁ s₂ : Finset α} {t t₁ t₂ : α → Finset β}

/-- `disjiUnion s f h` is the set such that `a ∈ disjiUnion s f` iff `a ∈ f i` for some `i ∈ s`.
It is the same as `s.biUnion f`, but it does not require decidable equality on the type. The
hypothesis ensures that the sets are disjoint. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variant797b61b546421b190ce371e3f1c14ad35bdfb2bb2259574e1161caf4cdb70644.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variant797b61b546421b190ce371e3f1c14ad35bdfb2bb2259574e1161caf4cdb70644.lean#L3450).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b60684812356eac00940fb922aa14757ea39b085` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
