## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6e2c2d67-c665-14ee-30fe-3199009e3299`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 448–456.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem prod_set_coe (s : Set ι) [Fintype s] : (∏ i : s, f i) = ∏ i ∈ s.toFinset, f i :=
  (Finset.prod_subtype s.toFinset (fun _ ↦ Set.mem_toFinset) f).symm

/-- The product of a function `g` defined only on a set `s` is equal to
the product of a function `f` defined everywhere,
as long as `f` and `g` agree on `s`, and `f = 1` off `s`. -/
@[to_additive "The sum of a function `g` defined only on a set `s` is equal to
the sum of a function `f` defined everywhere,
as long as `f` and `g` agree on `s`, and `f = 0` off `s`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Varianteec5f83656c5e0901f241f202bdda975b085e9567b353684f24c5efa118f0df3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Varianteec5f83656c5e0901f241f202bdda975b085e9567b353684f24c5efa118f0df3.lean#L448).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `354a6eb14c150ad834ae953f0c21f023af30ff9b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
