## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3a40229bab61f60a3c09bacdb031eae308ea1883cbe59f8f77cfafef63bbd64a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1084–1096.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simps!] def piLinearMap :
    MultilinearMap R M₁' M₂ →ₗ[R]
    MultilinearMap R (fun i ↦ M₁ i →ₗ[R] M₁' i) (MultilinearMap R M₁ M₂) where
  toFun g := (LinearMap.applyₗ g).compMultilinearMap compLinearMapMultilinear
  map_add' := by simp
  map_smul' := by simp

end

/-- If one multiplies by `c i` the coordinates in a finset `s`, then the image under a multilinear
map is multiplied by `∏ i ∈ s, c i`. This is mainly an auxiliary statement to prove the result when
`s = univ`, given in `map_smul_univ`, although it can be useful in its own right as it does not
require the index set `ι` to be finite. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variantd140b673a633ab0f467b5282902ae022c23b202ef1a5605e23c025c89e0ab87b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variantd140b673a633ab0f467b5282902ae022c23b202ef1a5605e23c025c89e0ab87b.lean#L1084).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a2b2a00c76a87ec6e1d861c21016714c5fbd3b12` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
