## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5ae93aec-cec7-a57f-79cd-9eecca1d95d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 198–208.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem comap_cobounded_le_iff [Bornology β] {f : α → β} :
    (cobounded β).comap f ≤ cobounded α ↔ ∀ ⦃s⦄, IsBounded s → IsBounded (f '' s) := by
  refine
    ⟨fun h s hs => ?_, fun h t ht =>
      ⟨(f '' tᶜ)ᶜ, h <| IsCobounded.compl ht, compl_subset_comm.1 <| subset_preimage_image _ _⟩⟩
  obtain ⟨t, ht, hts⟩ := h hs.compl
  rw [subset_compl_comm, ← preimage_compl] at hts
  exact (IsCobounded.compl ht).subset ((image_subset f hts).trans <| image_preimage_subset _ _)

end

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variant82abc116fc8797df29c7afdb370ef7a755153bd2b169c2685740f6bc7471efe8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variant82abc116fc8797df29c7afdb370ef7a755153bd2b169c2685740f6bc7471efe8.lean#L198).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5bcabb11a441aa9c4f45028f07cb321c7f82c5af` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
