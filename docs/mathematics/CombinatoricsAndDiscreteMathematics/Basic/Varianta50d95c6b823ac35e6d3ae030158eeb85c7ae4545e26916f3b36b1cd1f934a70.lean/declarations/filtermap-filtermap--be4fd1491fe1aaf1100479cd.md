## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bcce65fb-c2a8-bc15-5463-489dfa39e63c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2143–2147.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem filterMap_filterMap (f : α → Option β) (g : β → Option γ) (s : Multiset α) :
    filterMap g (filterMap f s) = filterMap (fun x => (f x).bind g) s :=
  Quot.inductionOn s fun l => congr_arg ofList <| List.filterMap_filterMap f g l
#align multiset.filter_map_filter_map Multiset.filterMap_filterMap

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Varianta50d95c6b823ac35e6d3ae030158eeb85c7ae4545e26916f3b36b1cd1f934a70.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Varianta50d95c6b823ac35e6d3ae030158eeb85c7ae4545e26916f3b36b1cd1f934a70.lean#L2143).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3e14da250d25792008faaaf220d8d578be00c961` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
