## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6d4018fe-fdb8-00bb-09cb-e632e59c0764`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1497–1505.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem pmap_cons {p : α → Prop} (f : ∀ a, p a → β) (a : α) (m : Multiset α) :
    ∀ h : ∀ b ∈ a ::ₘ m, p b,
      pmap f (a ::ₘ m) h =
        f a (h a (mem_cons_self a m)) ::ₘ pmap f m fun a ha => h a <| mem_cons_of_mem ha :=
  Quotient.inductionOn m fun _l _h => rfl
#align multiset.pmap_cons Multiset.pmap_cons

/-- "Attach" a proof that `a ∈ s` to each element `a` in `s` to produce
  a multiset on `{x // x ∈ s}`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variantfca94177a3ea2c50cb00b0d11b7a8d5111c134ac475fb35cb482ee33b05286f7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variantfca94177a3ea2c50cb00b0d11b7a8d5111c134ac475fb35cb482ee33b05286f7.lean#L1497).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5ada2ea5263a1ce077752f1040a3f6ed1894c2de` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
