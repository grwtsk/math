## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1f7eba7f-b7ae-9ee5-5a31-dcd643e2c8f2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2821–2831.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rel_replicate_left {m : Multiset α} {a : α} {r : α → α → Prop} {n : ℕ} :
    (replicate n a).Rel r m ↔ card m = n ∧ ∀ x, x ∈ m → r a x :=
  ⟨fun h =>
    ⟨(card_eq_card_of_rel h).symm.trans (card_replicate _ _), fun x hx => by
      obtain ⟨b, hb1, hb2⟩ := exists_mem_of_rel_of_mem (rel_flip.2 h) hx
      rwa [eq_of_mem_replicate hb1] at hb2⟩,
    fun h =>
    rel_of_forall (fun x y hx hy => (eq_of_mem_replicate hx).symm ▸ h.2 _ hy)
      (Eq.trans (card_replicate _ _) h.1.symm)⟩
#align multiset.rel_replicate_left Multiset.rel_replicate_left

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variantfca94177a3ea2c50cb00b0d11b7a8d5111c134ac475fb35cb482ee33b05286f7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variantfca94177a3ea2c50cb00b0d11b7a8d5111c134ac475fb35cb482ee33b05286f7.lean#L2821).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5ada2ea5263a1ce077752f1040a3f6ed1894c2de` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
