## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9cf9441e-a792-ecae-f0ad-4e48ba10194c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 313–319.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem univ_filter_exists (f : α → β) [Fintype β] [DecidablePred fun y => ∃ x, f x = y]
    [DecidableEq β] : (Finset.univ.filter fun y => ∃ x, f x = y) = Finset.univ.image f := by
  ext
  simp
#align finset.univ_filter_exists Finset.univ_filter_exists

/-- Note this is a special case of `(Finset.image_preimage f univ _).symm`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variantc1c65510353a0490619d9784e5a0b13bce335ee566949f343feddafad62a1e9d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variantc1c65510353a0490619d9784e5a0b13bce335ee566949f343feddafad62a1e9d.lean#L313).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `15a4d359f65f18c7aebf13349fd93f47a203a9ef` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
