## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bd5a7a40-92a3-5e4d-20b5-a324fe2ff8be`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 499–507.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tprod_range {g : γ → β} (f : β → α) (hg : Injective g) :
    ∏' x : Set.range g, f x = ∏' x, f (g x) := by
  rw [← Set.image_univ, tprod_image f hg.injOn]
  simp_rw [← comp_apply (g := g), tprod_univ (f ∘ g)]

/-- If `f b = 1` for all `b ∈ t`, then the product of `f a` with `a ∈ s` is the same as the
product of `f a` with `a ∈ s ∖ t`. -/
@[to_additive "If `f b = 0` for all `b ∈ t`, then the sum of `f a` with `a ∈ s` is the same as the
sum of `f a` with `a ∈ s ∖ t`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Varianta0ae451e96f2f1887943649a6e9b6f5358469b49663ab399f0c3a1bb0d54ff87.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Varianta0ae451e96f2f1887943649a6e9b6f5358469b49663ab399f0c3a1bb0d54ff87.lean#L499).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `af74f50b39b8b9faf8480110a70a877d90262fe8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
