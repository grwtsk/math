## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:121e37508b7cf0bae582e1db4ee96f961c5da2914cd8492f9e459e111a395f01`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 719–728.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def semigroup [Semigroup α] : Semigroup (Finset α) :=
  coe_injective.semigroup _ coe_mul

section CommSemigroup

variable [CommSemigroup α] {s t : Finset α}

/-- `Finset α` is a `CommSemigroup` under pointwise operations if `α` is. -/
@[to_additive (attr := instance_reducible)
  /-- `Finset α` is an `AddCommSemigroup` under pointwise operations if `α` is. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variant583c5bda6b78379720190558a127d9fd4eab42a81920e4db72e9f2f792b01299.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variant583c5bda6b78379720190558a127d9fd4eab42a81920e4db72e9f2f792b01299.lean#L719).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0046c403d7dbf72ccf4e849dbda05e2c93053c54` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
