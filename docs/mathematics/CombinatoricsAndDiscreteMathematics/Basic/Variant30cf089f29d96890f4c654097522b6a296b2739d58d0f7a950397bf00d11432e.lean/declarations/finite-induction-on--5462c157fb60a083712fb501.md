## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:49838d9a-78ee-a77a-6393-0f610568570e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 690–705.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Finite.induction_on {motive : ∀ s : Set α, s.Finite → Prop} (s : Set α) (hs : s.Finite)
    (empty : motive ∅ finite_empty)
    (insert : ∀ {a s}, a ∉ s →
      ∀ hs : Set.Finite s, motive s hs → motive (insert a s) (hs.insert a)) :
    motive s hs := by
  lift s to Finset α using id hs
  induction' s using Finset.cons_induction_on with a s ha ih
  · simpa
  · simpa using @insert a s ha (Set.toFinite _) (ih _)

/-- Induction principle for finite sets: To prove a property `C` of a finite set `s`, it's enough
to prove for the empty set and to prove that `C t → C ({a} ∪ t)` for all `t ⊆ s`.

This is analogous to `Finset.induction_on'`. See also `Set.Finite.induction_on` for the version
requiring `C t → C ({a} ∪ t)` for all `t`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variant30cf089f29d96890f4c654097522b6a296b2739d58d0f7a950397bf00d11432e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variant30cf089f29d96890f4c654097522b6a296b2739d58d0f7a950397bf00d11432e.lean#L690).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `07342e14185fa66a95181e899b239aae08621bb9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
