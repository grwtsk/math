## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:00f56e58-a945-265d-9294-e835333c84fc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 245–252.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem factors_pow_count_prod [DecidableEq α] {x : α} (hx : x ≠ 0) :
    (∏ p ∈ (factors x).toFinset, p ^ (factors x).count p) ~ᵤ x :=
  calc
  _ = prod (∑ a ∈ toFinset (factors x), count a (factors x) • {a}) := by
    simp only [prod_sum, prod_nsmul, prod_singleton]
  _ = prod (factors x) := by rw [toFinset_sum_count_nsmul_eq (factors x)]
  _ ~ᵤ x := factors_prod hx

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variant40b9690c661feaf2a41bba54ed40ea2c1df34eeba7bd203af438a76aa67a1642.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Basic/Variant40b9690c661feaf2a41bba54ed40ea2c1df34eeba7bd203af438a76aa67a1642.lean#L245).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ff43708e5be15f293a85076e7e453edd2cb5c4c2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
