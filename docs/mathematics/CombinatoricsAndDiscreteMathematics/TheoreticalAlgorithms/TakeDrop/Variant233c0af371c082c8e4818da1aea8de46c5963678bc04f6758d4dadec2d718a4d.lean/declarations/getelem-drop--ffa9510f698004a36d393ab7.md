## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c67dd0c2-5730-03f2-0f63-37ca09e3e650`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 245–253.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem getElem_drop' {xs : List α} {i j : Nat} (h : i + j < xs.length) :
    xs[i + j] = (xs.drop i)[j]'(lt_length_drop h) := by
  have : i ≤ xs.length := Nat.le_trans (Nat.le_add_right _ _) (Nat.le_of_lt h)
  rw [getElem_of_eq (take_append_drop i xs).symm h, getElem_append_right]
  · simp [Nat.min_eq_left this, Nat.add_sub_cancel_left]
  · simp [Nat.min_eq_left this, Nat.le_add_right]

/-- The `i + j`-th element of a list coincides with the `j`-th element of the list obtained by
dropping the first `i` elements. Version designed to rewrite from the small list to the big list. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/TakeDrop/Variant233c0af371c082c8e4818da1aea8de46c5963678bc04f6758d4dadec2d718a4d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/TakeDrop/Variant233c0af371c082c8e4818da1aea8de46c5963678bc04f6758d4dadec2d718a4d.lean#L245).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `edbba2789359903a141f25158271a09535561846` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
