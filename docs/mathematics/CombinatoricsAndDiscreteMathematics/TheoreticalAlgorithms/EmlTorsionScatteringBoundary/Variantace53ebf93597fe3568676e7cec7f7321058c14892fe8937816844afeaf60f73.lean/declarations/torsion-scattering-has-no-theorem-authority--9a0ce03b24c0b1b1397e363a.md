## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:139cbe60-7707-e7e3-d2e9-9ec13729b4c1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 295–302.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem torsion_scattering_has_no_theorem_authority :
    torsionCurveWithOrderedClasses.theoremAuthority = false ∧
      positiveTorsionClass.theoremAuthority = false ∧
      (PhiTorsion positiveTorsionClass).theoremAuthority = false ∧
      defaultTorsionRingAlgebraProgression.theoremAuthority = false := by
  native_decide

end Think.Arithmetic.EmlTorsionScatteringBoundary
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/EmlTorsionScatteringBoundary/Variantace53ebf93597fe3568676e7cec7f7321058c14892fe8937816844afeaf60f73.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/EmlTorsionScatteringBoundary/Variantace53ebf93597fe3568676e7cec7f7321058c14892fe8937816844afeaf60f73.lean#L295).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aa4dc764c33b6f193622fdb2c5062eb6ee30b3b1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
