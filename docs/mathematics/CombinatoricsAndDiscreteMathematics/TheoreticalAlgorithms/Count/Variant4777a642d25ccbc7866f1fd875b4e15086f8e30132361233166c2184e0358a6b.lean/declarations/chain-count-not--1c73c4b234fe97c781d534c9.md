## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d38d71d5-2eda-c4b4-ecf1-f3855d5fb2bb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–67.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Chain.count_not :
    ∀ {b : Bool} {l : List Bool}, Chain (· ≠ ·) b l → count (!b) l = count b l + length l % 2
  | b, [], _h => rfl
  | b, x :: l, h => by
    obtain rfl : b = !x := Bool.eq_not_iff.2 (rel_of_chain_cons h)
    rw [Bool.not_not, count_cons_self, count_cons_of_ne x.not_ne_self,
      Chain.count_not (chain_of_chain_cons h), length, add_assoc, Nat.mod_two_add_succ_mod_two]
#align list.chain.count_bnot List.Chain.count_not

namespace Chain'

variable {l : List Bool}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Count/Variant4777a642d25ccbc7866f1fd875b4e15086f8e30132361233166c2184e0358a6b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Count/Variant4777a642d25ccbc7866f1fd875b4e15086f8e30132361233166c2184e0358a6b.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3279cfa58f65c4dbaf40bb3f5c2d783c8f2f1826` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
