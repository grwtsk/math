## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:21f3c10f-7e3e-40bb-db8e-639746a211eb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–106.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem two_mul_count_bool_eq_ite (hl : IsChain (· ≠ ·) l) (b : Bool) :
    2 * count b l =
      if Even (length l) then length l else
      if Option.some b == l.head? then length l + 1 else length l - 1 := by
  by_cases h2 : Even (length l)
  · rw [ite_eq_left h2, hl.two_mul_count_bool_of_even h2]
  · rcases l with - | ⟨x, l⟩
    · exact (h2 .zero).elim
    grind [hl.tail.two_mul_count_bool_of_even]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Count/Variant0f68b9b31caefa8a96abad8c287e7a5e4184500815bad13928a39b8ad78b231e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Count/Variant0f68b9b31caefa8a96abad8c287e7a5e4184500815bad13928a39b8ad78b231e.lean#L97).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `00e9b6b33b0a72156cd0ec75e0bdb36814a6c6e6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
