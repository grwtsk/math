## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5781b608-3a62-40dd-0f7b-206a40d02c21`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–66.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem count_not_eq_count (hl : Chain' (· ≠ ·) l) (h2 : Even (length l)) (b : Bool) :
    count (!b) l = count b l := by
  rcases l with - | ⟨x, l⟩
  · rfl
  rw [length_cons, Nat.even_add_one, Nat.not_even_iff] at h2
  suffices count (!x) (x :: l) = count x (x :: l) by
    cases b <;> cases x <;> (try exact this) <;> exact this.symm
  rw [count_cons_of_ne x.not_ne_self.symm, hl.count_not, h2, count_cons_self]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Count/Variant0893f90fcb6ee7b18f0e07e9294cff9dc15e55ff5738234e8b4884edeb852efd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Count/Variant0893f90fcb6ee7b18f0e07e9294cff9dc15e55ff5738234e8b4884edeb852efd.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8dbc61badd1e456facc5ddd69132b4c1a7c57a24` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
