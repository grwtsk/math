## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:732dff1d6286b06791d7ba32d42b62d71a91a906474a3376453d457d94528672`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 167–175.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[expose] def verifiedTargetRevision?
    (admitted : AdmittedProposal Host EdgeId) : Option Nat :=
  admitted.register.current.map fun value ↦ value.revision.val

/-- Exact current-state predicate required immediately before a runtime commit.
It compares both race-sensitive coordinates: the source snapshot and the
target register revision.  `none = none` is a legitimate match for an empty
verified register; `commitAdmitted` then creates the first finite projection
instead of publishing a revision with no corresponding node. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/XYZDomModel/Variant465210755dcfe2643a5a1b6b481265dfc4c81e1d1c3fb5d71a0d6c8ffaaf7875.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/XYZDomModel/Variant465210755dcfe2643a5a1b6b481265dfc4c81e1d1c3fb5d71a0d6c8ffaaf7875.lean#L167).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c05cfe00e0a8d859f09a73d6c0e4aa6cee26934c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
