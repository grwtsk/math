## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2c440213-f34e-e83d-841f-afe4591ced2e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 113–125.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  funext α β f l
  let rec go : ∀ as acc, filterMapTR.go f as acc = acc.toList ++ as.filterMap f
    | [], acc => by simp [filterMapTR.go, filterMap]
    | a::as, acc => by
      simp only [filterMapTR.go, go as, Array.toList_push, append_assoc, singleton_append,
        filterMap]
      split <;> simp [*]
  exact (go l #[]).symm

/-- Drop `none`s from a list, and replace each remaining `some a` with `a`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Impl/Variantbb7570239a6aba62a513a791dbeea72a0c3fc721b90ddfa9d959350ab6a8bbb8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Impl/Variantbb7570239a6aba62a513a791dbeea72a0c3fc721b90ddfa9d959350ab6a8bbb8.lean#L113).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `45a614232e9f6e8dd3bb837139440fd61fdcdb60` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
