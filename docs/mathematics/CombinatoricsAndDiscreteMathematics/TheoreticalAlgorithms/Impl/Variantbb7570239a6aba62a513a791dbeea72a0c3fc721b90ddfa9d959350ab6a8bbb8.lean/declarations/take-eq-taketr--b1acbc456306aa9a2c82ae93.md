## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8d807343-eae1-fe20-6863-a8abb25b7d7e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 210–233.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[csimp] theorem take_eq_takeTR : @take = @takeTR := by
  funext α i l; simp [takeTR]
  suffices ∀ xs acc, l = acc.toList ++ xs → takeTR.go l xs i acc = acc.toList ++ xs.take i from
    (this l #[] (by simp)).symm
  intro xs; induction xs generalizing i with intro acc
  | nil => cases i <;> simp [take, takeTR.go]
  | cons x xs IH =>
    cases i with simp only [take, takeTR.go]
    | zero => simp
    | succ n => intro h; rw [IH] <;> simp_all

/-! ### takeWhile -/


/--
 Returns the longest initial segment of `xs` for which `p` returns true.

`O(|xs|)`. This is a tail-recursive version of `List.take`, used at runtime.

Examples:
* `[7, 6, 4, 8].takeWhileTR (· > 5) = [7, 6]`
* `[7, 6, 6, 5].takeWhileTR (· > 5) = [7, 6, 6]`
* `[7, 6, 6, 8].takeWhileTR (· > 5) = [7, 6, 6, 8]`

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Impl/Variantbb7570239a6aba62a513a791dbeea72a0c3fc721b90ddfa9d959350ab6a8bbb8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Impl/Variantbb7570239a6aba62a513a791dbeea72a0c3fc721b90ddfa9d959350ab6a8bbb8.lean#L210).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `45a614232e9f6e8dd3bb837139440fd61fdcdb60` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
