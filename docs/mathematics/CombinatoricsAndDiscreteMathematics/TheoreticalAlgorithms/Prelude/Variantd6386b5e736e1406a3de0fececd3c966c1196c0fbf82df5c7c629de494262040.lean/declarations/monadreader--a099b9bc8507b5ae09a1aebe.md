## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c46d8572eb4e39c529c565a344ca6962c5eb3e48738e54e7f534a5eb70e589be`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 4260–4276.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class MonadReader (ρ : outParam (Type u)) (m : Type u → Type v) where
  /--
  Retrieves the local value.

  Use `readThe` to explicitly specify a type when more than one value is available.
  -/
  read : m ρ

export MonadReader (read)

/--
Retrieves the local value whose type is `ρ`.  This is useful when a monad supports reading more than
one type of value.

Use `read` for a version that expects the type `ρ` to be inferred from `m`.
-/
@[always_inline, inline]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Prelude/Variantd6386b5e736e1406a3de0fececd3c966c1196c0fbf82df5c7c629de494262040.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Prelude/Variantd6386b5e736e1406a3de0fececd3c966c1196c0fbf82df5c7c629de494262040.lean#L4260).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a48bfcd7f182375f04a8fe3f19bf3e8424b106cd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
