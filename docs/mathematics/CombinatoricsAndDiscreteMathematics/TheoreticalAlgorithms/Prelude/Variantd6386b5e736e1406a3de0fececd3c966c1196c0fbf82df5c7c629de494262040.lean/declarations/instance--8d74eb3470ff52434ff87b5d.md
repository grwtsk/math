## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e1022ae8cb2ac54d9bc4cb41fe2c7df519041ef093b99e422f0e4ff217548a91`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 3582–3596.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : DecidableEq String := String.decEq

/--
A byte position in a `String`, according to its UTF-8 encoding.

Character positions (counting the Unicode code points rather than bytes) are represented by plain
`Nat`s. Indexing a `String` by a `String.Pos.Raw` takes constant time, while character positions need to
be translated internally to byte positions, which takes linear time.

A byte position `p` is *valid* for a string `s` if `0 ≤ p ≤ s.rawEndPos` and `p` lies on a UTF-8
character boundary, see `String.Pos.IsValid`.

There is another type, `String.Pos`, which bundles the validity predicate. Using `String.Pos`
instead of `String.Pos.Raw` is recommended because it will lead to less error handling and fewer edge cases.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Prelude/Variantd6386b5e736e1406a3de0fececd3c966c1196c0fbf82df5c7c629de494262040.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Prelude/Variantd6386b5e736e1406a3de0fececd3c966c1196c0fbf82df5c7c629de494262040.lean#L3582).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a48bfcd7f182375f04a8fe3f19bf3e8424b106cd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
