## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cbbba1a3-0bf0-6714-895e-2fb6b0f37730`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 76–92.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem preimage_iUnionLift (t : Set β) :
    iUnionLift S f hf T hT ⁻¹' t =
      inclusion hT ⁻¹' (⋃ i, inclusion (subset_iUnion S i) '' f i ⁻¹' t) := by
  ext x
  simp only [mem_preimage, mem_iUnion, mem_image]
  constructor
  · rcases mem_iUnion.1 (hT x.prop) with ⟨i, hi⟩
    refine fun h => ⟨i, ⟨x, hi⟩, ?_, rfl⟩
    rwa [iUnionLift_of_mem x hi] at h
  · rintro ⟨i, ⟨y, hi⟩, h, hxy⟩
    obtain rfl : y = x := congr_arg Subtype.val hxy
    rwa [iUnionLift_of_mem x hi]

/-- `iUnionLift_const` is useful for proving that `iUnionLift` is a homomorphism
  of algebraic structures when defined on the Union of algebraic subobjects.
  For example, it could be used to prove that the lift of a collection
  of group homomorphisms on a union of subgroups preserves `1`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/UnionLift/Variant5b5ec2af29e41ed98eefe1494a78184357d29b017181a62d45c4c0088009a38a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/UnionLift/Variant5b5ec2af29e41ed98eefe1494a78184357d29b017181a62d45c4c0088009a38a.lean#L76).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `06f1abffae6c657edea42db603c82b1aeb542ae2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
