## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6be4acf5-a272-e395-7990-76fa35ca49e0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 84–92.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem size_eraseP {xs : Array α} : (xs.eraseP p).size = if xs.any p then xs.size - 1 else xs.size := by
  split <;> rename_i h
  · simp only [any_eq_true] at h
    obtain ⟨i, h, w⟩ := h
    simp [size_eraseP_of_mem (xs := xs) (by simp) w]
  · simp only [any_eq_true] at h
    rw [eraseP_of_forall_getElem_not]
    simp_all

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Erase/Variant58c14e7652b61aa37810456e620961064c42ee2c0d00ea523861700deab2d8d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Erase/Variant58c14e7652b61aa37810456e620961064c42ee2c0d00ea523861700deab2d8d7.lean#L84).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `de6d85b0e8b7751aa61d506a7060b32350efb108` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
