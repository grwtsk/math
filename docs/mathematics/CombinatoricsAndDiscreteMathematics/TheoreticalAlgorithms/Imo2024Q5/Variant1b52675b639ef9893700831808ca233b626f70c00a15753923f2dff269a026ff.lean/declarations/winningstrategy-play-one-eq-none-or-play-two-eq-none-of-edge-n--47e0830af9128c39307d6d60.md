## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:343a1ca9-0ad8-e9ec-4b24-3c966968a3b3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1010–1022.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma winningStrategy_play_one_eq_none_or_play_two_eq_none_of_edge_N (hN : 2 ≤ N)
    {m : MonsterData N} (hc₁N : (m (row1 hN) : ℕ) = N) :
    (winningStrategy hN).play m 3 ⟨1, by norm_num⟩ = none ∨
      (winningStrategy hN).play m 3 ⟨2, by norm_num⟩ = none := by
  simp_rw [winningStrategy_play_one_of_edge_N hN hc₁N, winningStrategy_play_two_of_edge_N hN hc₁N,
    Option.map_eq_none_iff]
  have hc₁r0 : m.reflect (row1 hN) = 0 := by
    simp only [MonsterData.reflect, Function.Embedding.coeFn_mk, Function.comp_apply,
      ← Fin.rev_last, Fin.rev_inj]
    rw [Fin.ext_iff]
    exact hc₁N
  exact winningStrategy_play_one_eq_none_or_play_two_eq_none_of_edge_zero hN hc₁r0

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Imo2024Q5/Variant1b52675b639ef9893700831808ca233b626f70c00a15753923f2dff269a026ff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Imo2024Q5/Variant1b52675b639ef9893700831808ca233b626f70c00a15753923f2dff269a026ff.lean#L1010).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b28fa94005ef9943d584f612403380c8a94c743a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
