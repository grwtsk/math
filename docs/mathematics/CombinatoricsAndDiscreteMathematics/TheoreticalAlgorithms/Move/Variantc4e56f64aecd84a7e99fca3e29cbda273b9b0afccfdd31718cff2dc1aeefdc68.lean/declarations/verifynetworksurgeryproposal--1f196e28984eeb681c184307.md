## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:64e6464d31f125f158611e7a57b5fc9802b635472ba47b30dc06133163049a1a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 714–726.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[expose] noncomputable def verifyNetworkSurgeryProposal
    (context : NetworkSurgeryAdmissionContext)
    (proposal : PreparedNetworkSurgeryProposal) :
    NetworkSurgeryVerificationResult context := by
  classical
  exact if valid : proposal.Valid context then
    .admitted ⟨proposal, valid⟩
  else if proposal.IsReplay context then
    .replay proposal
  else
    .rejected (firstProposalFailure context proposal)

@[surface_novel, surface_published]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Move/Variantc4e56f64aecd84a7e99fca3e29cbda273b9b0afccfdd31718cff2dc1aeefdc68.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Move/Variantc4e56f64aecd84a7e99fca3e29cbda273b9b0afccfdd31718cff2dc1aeefdc68.lean#L714).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bd81b1d6be1be5152930e1c05180214273a61dcc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
