## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9b87608077ceb5a7dea1d589391e6809f37ab16f68e3bdc7d348297a6f70e2a9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 49–56.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getWorkspaceRoot : IO Lake.Package := do
  let (elanInstall?, leanInstall?, lakeInstall?) ← Lake.findInstall?
  let config ← Lake.MonadError.runEIO <| Lake.mkLoadConfig { elanInstall?, leanInstall?, lakeInstall? }
  let some workspace ← Lake.loadWorkspace config |>.toBaseIO
    | throw <| IO.userError "failed to load Lake workspace"
  return workspace.root

/-- Convert the options that Lake knows into the option that Lean knows. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/LintStyle/Variant9026d0730e48d31316535f213d399accf63c772859e52aea9d8568d6250e6218.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/LintStyle/Variant9026d0730e48d31316535f213d399accf63c772859e52aea9d8568d6250e6218.lean#L49).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bbebb11ba1907c4f84ceadb3f716161efd21c712` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
