## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e319f830b4bd50d5eba776528f3a77a8c6bc10d4d5d3afb7887984c547fcd1be`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 49–64.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toLeanOptions (opts : Array Lake.LeanOption) : Lean.Options :=
  opts.foldl (init := Lean.Options.empty) fun opts o =>
    -- Strip off the `weak.` prefix, like Lean does when parsing command line arguments.
    if o.name.getRoot == `weak
    then
      opts.insert (o.name.replacePrefix `weak Lean.Name.anonymous) o.value.toDataValue
    else
      opts.insert o.name o.value.toDataValue

/-- Determine the `Lean.Options` from the Lakefile of the current project.

We have to do this since style linters do not run in the `CoreM`/`CommandElabM` monads,
and so they do not get access to the options in scope.

Please do not confuse this with the Lean options at the moment that `lint-style` was compiled.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/LintStyle/Variant9675e33d1d65316757ce62dc1a0cb28e5962c10cfa78df4d1550621aaaf3f328.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/LintStyle/Variant9675e33d1d65316757ce62dc1a0cb28e5962c10cfa78df4d1550621aaaf3f328.lean#L49).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77861e452bb28d6b7bd87abecc9e2f30fafdd60d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
