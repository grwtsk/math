## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f26e9a18-ec29-f258-f264-c287233b98db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 267–286.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    | cons  _ h => exact ih hs _ hc h |>.trans (sublist_orderedInsert ..)
    | cons_cons _ h =>
      specialize ih (hs.erase _) _ (erase_cons_head a ‹List _› ▸ hc.erase a) h
      have hm := hc.mem_iff.mp <| mem_cons_self ..
      have he := orderedInsert_erase _ _ hm hs
      exact he ▸ Sublist.orderedInsert_sublist _ ih (pairwise_insertionSort ..)

/--
Another statement of stability of insertion sort.
If a pair `[a, b]` is a sublist of a permutation of `l` and `a ≼ b`,
then `[a, b]` is still a sublist of `insertionSort r l`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Sort/Variant6df4b3a64de97aa17801a2712eaba7d7ac8aa5fd5c9f48d31c4a0e8de34a1ca5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Sort/Variant6df4b3a64de97aa17801a2712eaba7d7ac8aa5fd5c9f48d31c4a0e8de34a1ca5.lean#L267).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9012b055d844f061694e062516bbcc885c6940d5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
