## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fdeec9a7dd64544db3adfba95622841a0a8a0e0c5c17a2e0c302e9298ee2de04`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 152–159.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def replaceMax {lt} (self : BinaryHeap α lt) (x : α) : Option α × BinaryHeap α lt :=
  match e: self.max with
  | none => (none, ⟨self.1.push x⟩)
  | some m =>
    let a := self.1.set ⟨0, size_pos_of_max e⟩ x
    (some m, ⟨heapifyDown lt a ⟨0, by simp; exact size_pos_of_max e⟩⟩)

/-- `O(log n)`. Replace the value at index `i` by `x`. Assumes that `x ≤ self.get i`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/BinaryHeap/Variante92bc70e35401a12e3ad783d65096784bd9d99a35dc09305ea1198549beebf05.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/BinaryHeap/Variante92bc70e35401a12e3ad783d65096784bd9d99a35dc09305ea1198549beebf05.lean#L152).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3bad79cf647bfc75fc03516db7f61a4593cbb92b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
