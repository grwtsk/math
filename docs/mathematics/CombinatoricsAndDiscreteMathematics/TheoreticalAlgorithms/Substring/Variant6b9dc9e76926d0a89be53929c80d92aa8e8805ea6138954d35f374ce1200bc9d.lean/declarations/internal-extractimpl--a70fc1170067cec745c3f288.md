## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5171f35d3dba02cad153c186b8c4b28dc6ecc8531ac7030273e83b48fd47faee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 223–233.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Internal.extractImpl : Substring.Raw → String.Pos.Raw → String.Pos.Raw → Substring.Raw :=
  Substring.Raw.extract

/--
Splits a substring `s` on occurrences of the separator string `sep`. The default separator is `" "`.

When `sep` is empty, the result is `[s]`. When `sep` occurs in overlapping patterns, the first match
is taken. There will always be exactly `n+1` elements in the returned list if there were `n`
non-overlapping matches of `sep` in the string. The separators are not included in the returned
substrings, which are all substrings of `s`'s string.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Substring/Variant6b9dc9e76926d0a89be53929c80d92aa8e8805ea6138954d35f374ce1200bc9d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Substring/Variant6b9dc9e76926d0a89be53929c80d92aa8e8805ea6138954d35f374ce1200bc9d.lean#L223).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2f2d9a9dfa756452888fa648e91b6c5c8b54c82f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
