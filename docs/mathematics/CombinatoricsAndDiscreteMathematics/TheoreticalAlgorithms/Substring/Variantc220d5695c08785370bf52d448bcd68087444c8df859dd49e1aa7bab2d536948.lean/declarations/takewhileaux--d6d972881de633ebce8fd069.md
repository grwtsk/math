## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ac371bc7c880fa4fd055efc5b880b0553942536b28700e96302151f412820c09`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 307–319.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[specialize] def takeWhileAux (s : String) (stopPos : String.Pos.Raw) (p : Char → Bool) (i : String.Pos.Raw) : String.Pos.Raw :=
  if h : i < stopPos then
    if p (i.get s) then
      have := Nat.sub_lt_sub_left h (String.Pos.Raw.lt_next s i)
      takeWhileAux s stopPos p (i.next s)
    else i
  else i
termination_by stopPos.1 - i.1

/--
Retains only the longest prefix of a substring in which a Boolean predicate returns `true` for all
characters by moving the substring's end position towards its start position.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Substring/Variantc220d5695c08785370bf52d448bcd68087444c8df859dd49e1aa7bab2d536948.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Substring/Variantc220d5695c08785370bf52d448bcd68087444c8df859dd49e1aa7bab2d536948.lean#L307).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b9b6fc154a6f3a56b5df2c227aa6da7a4f74e1d9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
