## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f149e0eb2b295d4aa8377094de58b787d80f93be02786abaace25fbfab1c168a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 382–400.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def certificateGrammar (certificate : Value) : Bool :=
  exactKeys ["schema", "plan_digest", "objects", "source", "destination", "archive",
    "preservation", "raw_sources", "occurrences", "outputs"] certificate &&
  match getArray "objects" certificate, getArray "raw_sources" certificate,
      getArray "occurrences" certificate, getArray "outputs" certificate with
  | some os, some rs, some cs, some xs =>
      os.all (fun row => exactKeys ["bytes"] row &&
        match getString "bytes" row with
        | some s => lowerHex s && decide (s.length % 2 = 0)
        | _ => false) &&
      (["source", "destination", "archive", "preservation"].all fun key =>
        match field key certificate with
        | some row => exactKeys ["root", "exists", "directories", "files"] row
        | _ => false) &&
      rs.all (exactKeys ["root", "exists", "directories", "files"]) &&
      cs.all (exactKeys ["origin", "source_root", "source_path", "target_area", "target", "object"]) &&
      xs.all (exactKeys ["area", "path", "object"])
  | _, _, _, _ => false

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/BoundedJsonRecordDecoding.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/BoundedJsonRecordDecoding.lean#L382).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ea38b8da556b6da6bed48c2a03264ae686ff1b23` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
