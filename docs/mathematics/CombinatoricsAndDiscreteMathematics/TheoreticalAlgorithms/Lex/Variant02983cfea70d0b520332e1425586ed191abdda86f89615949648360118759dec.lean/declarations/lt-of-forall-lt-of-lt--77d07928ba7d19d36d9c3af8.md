## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d2673bf2-a2f6-e7a6-6124-ac79f7cab7bc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 129–148.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lt_of_forall_lt_of_lt (a b : Lex (Π₀ i, α i)) (i : ι) :
    (∀ j < i, ofLex a j = ofLex b j) → ofLex a i < ofLex b i → a < b :=
  fun h1 h2 ↦ ⟨i, h1, h2⟩

end Zero

section Covariants

variable [LinearOrder ι] [∀ i, AddMonoid (α i)] [∀ i, LinearOrder (α i)]

/-!  We are about to sneak in a hypothesis that might appear to be too strong.
We assume `AddLeftStrictMono` (covariant with *strict* inequality `<`) also when proving the one
with the *weak* inequality `≤`. This is actually necessary: addition on `Lex (Π₀ i, α i)` may fail
to be monotone, when it is "just" monotone on `α i`. -/


section Left

variable [∀ i, AddLeftStrictMono (α i)]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Lex/Variant02983cfea70d0b520332e1425586ed191abdda86f89615949648360118759dec.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Lex/Variant02983cfea70d0b520332e1425586ed191abdda86f89615949648360118759dec.lean#L129).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `04d96859e2cc8d351e56e282cda98b1ad1bb3c71` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
