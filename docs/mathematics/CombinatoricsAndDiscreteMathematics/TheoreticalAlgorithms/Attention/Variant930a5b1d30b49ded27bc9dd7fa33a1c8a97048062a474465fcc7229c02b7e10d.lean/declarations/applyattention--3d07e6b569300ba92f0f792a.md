## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:680ad7b7a9bec1fd9eab1d18dabf607a4ff3b3f9229e6dd3e4e49e7b78e4742d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 112–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def applyAttention (weights : IntervalVector) (V : List IntervalVector)
    (prec : Int) : IntervalVector :=
  if V.isEmpty then []
  else
    let d_v := V.head!.length
    -- Initialize output as zeros
    let zero := List.replicate d_v (IntervalDyadic.singleton (Core.Dyadic.ofInt 0))
    -- Weighted sum: Σ weights[i] * V[i]
    let weighted := List.zipWith (fun w v_i =>
      v_i.map (fun vij => IntervalDyadic.mulRounded w vij prec)
    ) weights V
    weighted.foldl (fun acc v =>
      List.zipWith IntervalDyadic.add acc v
    ) zero

/-- Single-head scaled dot-product attention.

    Given:
    - Q: query matrix [seq_len, d_k] (as list of query vectors)
    - K: key matrix [seq_len, d_k] (as list of key vectors)
    - V: value matrix [seq_len, d_v] (as list of value vectors)

    Returns: output matrix [seq_len, d_v]

    Formula: softmax(Q × K^T / √d_k) × V
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Attention/Variant930a5b1d30b49ded27bc9dd7fa33a1c8a97048062a474465fcc7229c02b7e10d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Attention/Variant930a5b1d30b49ded27bc9dd7fa33a1c8a97048062a474465fcc7229c02b7e10d.lean#L112).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dee35a77b5b7cc4f8ef7470805b3c5a5bb7e3cb9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
