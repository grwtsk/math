## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e8e2e74acc70171d3f49887e031d7940d4501e2a7952b79112e238f6fd066677`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 169–194.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def importGraphReport (snapshots : List FileSnapshot) : String :=
  let graphHash := importGraphHash snapshots
  let dependencyHash := declarationDependencyGraphHash snapshots
  let reducerHash := finiteHash (String.intercalate "\n" (reducerTraceLines 0 snapshots))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/PresentationSelfAnnealMain/Varianta269be5a93d64cb8d3fd03e116c8adf0cca37fbc873ab86eec31a6e418216e1d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/PresentationSelfAnnealMain/Varianta269be5a93d64cb8d3fd03e116c8adf0cca37fbc873ab86eec31a6e418216e1d.lean#L169).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c7eeb0fa8f0d51ec340c56553e722d14e56948db` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
