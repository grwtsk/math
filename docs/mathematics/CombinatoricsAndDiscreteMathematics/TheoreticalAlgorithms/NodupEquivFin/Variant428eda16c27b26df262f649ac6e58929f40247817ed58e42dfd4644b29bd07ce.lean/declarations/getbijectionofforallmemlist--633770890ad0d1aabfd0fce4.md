## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c63709f59f48647b9571727f3bc90ed7b1bcf856459b8757d4cca83f56349501`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 47–58.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getBijectionOfForallMemList (l : List α) (nd : l.Nodup) (h : ∀ x : α, x ∈ l) :
    { f : Fin l.length → α // Function.Bijective f } :=
  ⟨fun i => l.get i, fun _ _ h => nd.get_inj_iff.1 h,
   fun x =>
    let ⟨i, hl⟩ := List.mem_iff_get.1 (h x)
    ⟨i, hl⟩⟩

variable [DecidableEq α]

/-- If `l` has no duplicates, then `List.get` defines an equivalence between `Fin (length l)` and
the set of elements of `l`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/NodupEquivFin/Variant428eda16c27b26df262f649ac6e58929f40247817ed58e42dfd4644b29bd07ce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/NodupEquivFin/Variant428eda16c27b26df262f649ac6e58929f40247817ed58e42dfd4644b29bd07ce.lean#L47).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `33cf34488191ff9624654d7407ea9b5eff046b93` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
