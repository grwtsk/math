## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f7a23c87-1237-a34e-b860-22f55931bbab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 294–302.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem parallel_empty (S : WSeq (Computation α)) (h : S.head ~> none) : parallel S = empty _ :=
  eq_empty_of_not_terminates fun ⟨⟨a, m⟩⟩ => by
    let ⟨c, cs, _⟩ := exists_of_mem_parallel m
    let ⟨n, nm⟩ := WSeq.exists_get?_of_mem cs
    let ⟨c', h'⟩ := WSeq.head_some_of_get?_some nm
    injection h h'

/-- Induction principle for parallel computations.
The reason this isn't trivial from `exists_of_mem_parallel` is because it eliminates to `Sort`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Parallel/Variant6463d76f95861fd796547a819f035f84fb1122888c90cb0575010e51f1f817fa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Parallel/Variant6463d76f95861fd796547a819f035f84fb1122888c90cb0575010e51f1f817fa.lean#L294).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1f4e626e79e7c178de53f14ea3aca1673b7add92` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
