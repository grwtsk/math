## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:468c190f-1ae0-f35f-3e6e-48115767d722`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 335–344.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem parallel_congr_lem {S T : WSeq (Computation α)} {a} (H : S.LiftRel Equiv T) :
    (∀ s ∈ S, s ~> a) ↔ ∀ t ∈ T, t ~> a :=
  ⟨fun h1 _ tT =>
    let ⟨_, sS, se⟩ := WSeq.exists_of_liftRel_right H tT
    (promises_congr se _).1 (h1 _ sS),
    fun h2 _ sS =>
    let ⟨_, tT, se⟩ := WSeq.exists_of_liftRel_left H sS
    (promises_congr se _).2 (h2 _ tT)⟩

-- The parallel operation is only deterministic when all computation paths lead to the same value
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Parallel/Variantb7951f2840fccb9d7a8b16f68b990c752b9e1e2bc6617ef44d3019bbbf2ae7d9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Parallel/Variantb7951f2840fccb9d7a8b16f68b990c752b9e1e2bc6617ef44d3019bbbf2ae7d9.lean#L335).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cabf25c273b382622b6d2c3454aaa51a48e12060` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
