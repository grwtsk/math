## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3153326eb2226eb08f424803a0777d89034a8ee6222576a04c073879d16c9ef9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2515–2527.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def BSDTheoremSeed.fromSmoothInput
    {C : LawfulShortWeierstrass.{u}}
    (_S : SmoothBSDTheoremInput C) :
    BSDTheoremSeed where
  theoremInputAvailable := True
  smoothTheoremInputAvailable := True
  sourceDescription := "Smooth BSD theorem input wraps a supplied BSDCertificate and smooth Mordell-Weil gate."
  boundary := [
    "This seed records that a smooth BSD theorem input was supplied.",
    "It does not construct BSD; the enclosed BSDCertificate remains the authority."
  ]

/-- A theorem seed produced from a packed smooth BSD theorem input. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/TheoremInput/Variant822fe3a5af012323267d3a38a0b3e758307abd17fae0e3a5d9a69e53ad700361.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/TheoremInput/Variant822fe3a5af012323267d3a38a0b3e758307abd17fae0e3a5d9a69e53ad700361.lean#L2515).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `625d88600494e21bf3064668d2f3d61d8682374b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
