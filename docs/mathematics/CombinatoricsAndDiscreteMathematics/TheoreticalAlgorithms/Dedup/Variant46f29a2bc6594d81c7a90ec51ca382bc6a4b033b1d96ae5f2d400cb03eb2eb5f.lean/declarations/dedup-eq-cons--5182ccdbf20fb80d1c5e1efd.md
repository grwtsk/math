## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ea23590e-ce36-ca4f-6e5d-a732e6fa4056`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 93–106.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dedup_eq_cons (l : List α) (a : α) (l' : List α) :
    l.dedup = a :: l' ↔ a ∈ l ∧ a ∉ l' ∧ l.dedup.tail = l' := by
  refine ⟨fun h => ?_, fun h => ?_⟩
  · refine ⟨mem_dedup.1 (h.symm ▸ mem_cons_self), fun ha => ?_, by rw [h, tail_cons]⟩
    have := count_pos_iff.2 ha
    have : count a l.dedup ≤ 1 := nodup_iff_count_le_one.1 (nodup_dedup l) a
    rw [h, count_cons_self] at this

  · have := @List.cons_head!_tail α ⟨a⟩ _ (ne_nil_of_mem (mem_dedup.2 h.1))
    have hal : a ∈ l.dedup := mem_dedup.2 h.1
    rw [← this, mem_cons, or_iff_not_imp_right] at hal
    exact this ▸ h.2.2.symm ▸ cons_eq_cons.2 ⟨(hal (h.2.2.symm ▸ h.2.1)).symm, rfl⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Dedup/Variant46f29a2bc6594d81c7a90ec51ca382bc6a4b033b1d96ae5f2d400cb03eb2eb5f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Dedup/Variant46f29a2bc6594d81c7a90ec51ca382bc6a4b033b1d96ae5f2d400cb03eb2eb5f.lean#L93).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `74bf89dce1b6233a01f9051bf43a59061b1c9459` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
