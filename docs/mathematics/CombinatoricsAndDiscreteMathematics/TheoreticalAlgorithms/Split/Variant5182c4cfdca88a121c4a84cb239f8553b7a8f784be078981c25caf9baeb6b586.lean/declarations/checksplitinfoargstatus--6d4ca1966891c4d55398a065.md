## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4a512b128b0ca3ff2b65b613beb375d0c3918de4fb19beea3cb124eb6579984b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 124–146.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def checkSplitInfoArgStatus (a b : Expr) (eq : Expr) : GoalM SplitStatus := do
  if (← isEqTrue eq <||> isEqFalse eq) then return .resolved
  let is := (← get).split.argPosMap[(a, b)]? |>.getD []
  let mut j := a.getAppNumArgs
  let mut it_a := a
  let mut it_b := b
  repeat
    unless it_a.isApp && it_b.isApp do return .ready 2
    j := j - 1
    if j ∉ is then
      let arg_a := it_a.appArg!
      let arg_b := it_b.appArg!
      unless (← isEqv arg_a arg_b) do
        trace_goal[grind.split] "may be irrelevant\na: {a}\nb: {b}\neq: {eq}\narg_a: {arg_a}\narg_b: {arg_b}, gen: {← getGeneration eq}"
        /-
        We tried to return `.notReady` because we would not be able to derive a congruence, but
        `grind_ite.lean` breaks when this heuristic is used. TODO: understand better why.
        -/
        return .ready 2 (tryPostpone := true)
    it_a := it_a.appFn!
    it_b := it_b.appFn!
  return .ready 2

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Split/Variant5182c4cfdca88a121c4a84cb239f8553b7a8f784be078981c25caf9baeb6b586.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Split/Variant5182c4cfdca88a121c4a84cb239f8553b7a8f784be078981c25caf9baeb6b586.lean#L124).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b43ce3f054bf56f72211b5d290ec1e7fce59a9bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
