## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ad8dc787-4519-7317-2a8f-b48dfcdd5fa0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 346–357.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
theorem mem_swap {xs : List α} (i j : Nat) {a : α} : a ∈ xs.swap i j ↔ a ∈ xs :=
  (swap_perm xs i j).mem_iff

/-! ### idxInj  -/

/-- `Subperm.idxInj` is an injective map from `Fin xs.length` to `Fin ys.length`
which exists when we have `xs <+~ ys`: conceptually it represents an embedding of
one list into the other. For example:
```
(by decide : [1, 0, 1] <+~ [5, 0, 1, 3, 1]).idxInj 1 = 1
```
-/
````

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Perm/Variant78192de4bd455ae99e2bbdcfe9cccbc9944b03fdee0f1a238ea0b69b19efadfe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Perm/Variant78192de4bd455ae99e2bbdcfe9cccbc9944b03fdee0f1a238ea0b69b19efadfe.lean#L346).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `881e18989c325b57d44d3ebca85497117adc440a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
