## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:27a6fac7-bef6-4f03-7cf2-9b35d45a7601`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 381–385.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem maximum_cons (a : α) (l : List α) : maximum (a :: l) = max ↑a (maximum l) :=
  List.reverseRecOn l (by simp [@max_eq_left (WithBot α) _ _ _ bot_le]) fun tl hd ih => by
    rw [← cons_append, maximum_concat, ih, maximum_concat, max_assoc]
#align list.maximum_cons List.maximum_cons

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/MinMax/Variantdbe5b1888cea485c6b1d53a23c772b56a447bd61c94fcd998849eb72eb4c2013.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/MinMax/Variantdbe5b1888cea485c6b1d53a23c772b56a447bd61c94fcd998849eb72eb4c2013.lean#L381).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b53ca8167c6249dced0a2ce247ce3e59f9452cb6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
