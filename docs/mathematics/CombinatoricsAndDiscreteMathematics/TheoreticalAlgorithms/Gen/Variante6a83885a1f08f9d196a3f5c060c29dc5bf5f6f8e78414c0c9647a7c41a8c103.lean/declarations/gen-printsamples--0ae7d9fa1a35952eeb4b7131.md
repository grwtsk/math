## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9a7096d62a9e66a167ba69efac7ffe5129197c2dcbec3468863461c43dd3af43`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 281–291.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Gen.printSamples {t : Type} [Repr t] (g : Gen t) : IO PUnit := do
  let xs := List.range 10
  for x in xs do
    try
      let y ← Gen.run g x
      IO.println s!"{repr y}"
    catch
      | .userError msg => IO.println msg
      | e => throw e

/-- Execute a `Gen` until it actually produces an output. May diverge for bad generators! -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Gen/Variante6a83885a1f08f9d196a3f5c060c29dc5bf5f6f8e78414c0c9647a7c41a8c103.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Gen/Variante6a83885a1f08f9d196a3f5c060c29dc5bf5f6f8e78414c0c9647a7c41a8c103.lean#L281).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1cc027a111bb47906d56d49079a8b28621f0dacf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
