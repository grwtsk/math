## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:513d1153b1530cff536325363daa79eb2bf5a4c6202c7b1aa9acf3176da9fdab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1027–1037.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def modify [Ord α] (k : α) (f : β → β) (t : Impl α β) :
    Impl α β :=
  match t with
  | .leaf => .leaf
  | .inner sz k' v' l r =>
    match compare k k' with
    | .lt => .inner sz k' v' (modify k f l) r
    | .gt => .inner sz k' v' l (modify k f r)
    | .eq => .inner sz k (f v') l r

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Operations/Variant51fd193ee68d85811b0686d6a7e5ae60f605f0bac28bdb333e274d77a8002437.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Operations/Variant51fd193ee68d85811b0686d6a7e5ae60f605f0bac28bdb333e274d77a8002437.lean#L1027).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `424b51b8cdec7b1f703e926f9a03be3b02b64d55` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
