## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aa5971be-3daf-4214-5c76-44eb5064e025`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 649–660.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nil_append (s : Seq α) : append nil s = s := by
  apply coinduction2; intro s
  dsimp [append]; rw [corec_eq]
  dsimp [append]; apply recOn s _ _
  · trivial
  · intro x s
    rw [destruct_cons]
    dsimp
    exact ⟨rfl, s, rfl, rfl⟩
#align stream.seq.nil_append Stream'.Seq.nil_append

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Seq/Variant29242684fd61ce4af008eca3979c6772d14231fbc68a4a02aba734e9a822069b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Seq/Variant29242684fd61ce4af008eca3979c6772d14231fbc68a4a02aba734e9a822069b.lean#L649).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a3e9a50d1697033f3b87a25f41335471b28c923` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
