## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9997999b47b12e5453ba10635faada5f1d5a4c2153823c3bad34f746007ce217`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 311–321.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Corec.f (f : β → Option (α × β)) : Option β → Option α × Option β
  | none => (none, none)
  | some b =>
    match f b with
    | none => (none, none)
    | some (a, b') => (some a, some b')
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false in
#align stream.seq.corec.F Stream'.Seq.Corec.f

/-- Corecursor for `Seq α` as a coinductive type. Iterates `f` to produce new elements
  of the sequence until `none` is obtained. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Seq/Variant1efeb7ab4c211cf7c48eb49706462c6ae71d910e438b7c445080c482f252cc74.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Seq/Variant1efeb7ab4c211cf7c48eb49706462c6ae71d910e438b7c445080c482f252cc74.lean#L311).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9b9cade0f229dd73bcbb574a33aab9610a9fbd6e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
