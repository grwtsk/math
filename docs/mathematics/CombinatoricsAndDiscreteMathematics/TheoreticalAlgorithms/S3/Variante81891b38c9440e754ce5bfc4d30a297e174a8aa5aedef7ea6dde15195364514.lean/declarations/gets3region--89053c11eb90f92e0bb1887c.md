## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b167b39419e092bffbabd1928217d0e3a7dda165ea9bb5717446dd147c18b128`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 102–113.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def getS3Region : IO String := do
  IO.ofExcept <| s3RegionFrom (← getEnvNonEmpty "MATHLIB_CACHE_S3_REGION")

/--
The curl arguments for an upload signed with S3 credentials. curl signs each
request with SigV4 (`--aws-sigv4`) in `region`. The
`x-amz-content-sha256: UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD` header lets curl sign a `-T` file
upload; curl supports this from 7.87, and this path runs in CI, whose runners
ship newer curls. A temporary credential also sends its session token, which
SigV4 covers as an `x-amz-*` header. The argument list carries the secrets,
so callers should print curl failures without the argument list.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/S3/Variante81891b38c9440e754ce5bfc4d30a297e174a8aa5aedef7ea6dde15195364514.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/S3/Variante81891b38c9440e754ce5bfc4d30a297e174a8aa5aedef7ea6dde15195364514.lean#L102).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2639a56dfcfbee74b839a4c4ec23c0d9878fadb3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
