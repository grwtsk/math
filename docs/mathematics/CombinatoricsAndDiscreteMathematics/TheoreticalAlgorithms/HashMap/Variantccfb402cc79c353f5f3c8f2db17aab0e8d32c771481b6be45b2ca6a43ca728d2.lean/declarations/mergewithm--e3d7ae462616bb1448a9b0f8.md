## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:37a7e8e9a1d9bb444026ea51718b1440594be716a3a54c4417b08bd822fc3991`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 28–39.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mergeWithM {m α β} [BEq α] [Hashable α] [Monad m] (f : α → β → β → m β)
    (self other : HashMap α β) : m (HashMap α β) :=
  other.foldM (init := self) fun map k v₂ =>
    match map[k]? with
    | none => return map.insert k v₂
    | some v₁ => return map.insert k (← f k v₁ v₂)

/--
`O(|other|)` amortized. Merge two `HashMap`s.
The values of keys which appear in both maps are combined using `f`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/HashMap/Variantccfb402cc79c353f5f3c8f2db17aab0e8d32c771481b6be45b2ca6a43ca728d2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/HashMap/Variantccfb402cc79c353f5f3c8f2db17aab0e8d32c771481b6be45b2ca6a43ca728d2.lean#L28).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4143fd6b864e894578dd777fdb3b9c0c33823f2f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
