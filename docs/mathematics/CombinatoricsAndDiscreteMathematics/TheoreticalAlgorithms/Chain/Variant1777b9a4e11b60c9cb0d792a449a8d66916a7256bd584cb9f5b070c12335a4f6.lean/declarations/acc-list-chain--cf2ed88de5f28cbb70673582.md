## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:14961bad-9a1c-552a-d45d-a7090c2b6ed6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 496–526.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem Acc.list_chain' {l : List.chains r} (acc : ∀ a ∈ l.val.head?, Acc r a) :
    Acc (List.lex_chains r) l := by
  obtain ⟨_ | ⟨a, l⟩, hl⟩ := l
  · apply Acc.intro; rintro ⟨_⟩ ⟨_⟩
  specialize acc a _
  · rw [List.head?_cons, Option.mem_some_iff]
  /- For an r-decreasing chain of the form a :: l, apply induction on a -/
  induction acc generalizing l with
  | intro a _ ih =>
    /- Bundle l with a proof that it is r-decreasing to form l' -/
    have hl' := (List.isChain_cons.1 hl).2
    let l' : List.chains r := ⟨l, hl'⟩
    have : Acc (List.lex_chains r) l' := by
      rcases l with - | ⟨b, l⟩
      · apply Acc.intro; rintro ⟨_⟩ ⟨_⟩
      /- l' is accessible by induction hypothesis -/
      · apply ih b (List.isChain_cons_cons.1 hl).1
    /- make l' a free variable and induct on l' -/

      · apply Acc.intro; rintro ⟨_⟩ ⟨_⟩
      · apply ih b hr
      · apply ihl ⟨m, (List.isChain_cons.1 hm).2⟩ hr

/-- If `r` is well-founded, the lexicographic order on `r`-decreasing chains is also. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Chain/Variant1777b9a4e11b60c9cb0d792a449a8d66916a7256bd584cb9f5b070c12335a4f6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Chain/Variant1777b9a4e11b60c9cb0d792a449a8d66916a7256bd584cb9f5b070c12335a4f6.lean#L496).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c23e7fa7242e8185f792c69469a411c8b0999b1e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
