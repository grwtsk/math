## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:81ff8b48-63f2-e975-66c7-dd8b931edeef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 95–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem add_eq_eval₃ [Semiring R] [AddCommMonoid M] [Module R M] {a₁ : R × M} (a₂ : R × M)
    {l₁ l₂ l : NF R M} (h : (a₁ ::ᵣ l₁).eval + l₂.eval = l.eval) :
    (a₁ ::ᵣ l₁).eval + (a₂ ::ᵣ l₂).eval = (a₂ ::ᵣ l).eval := by
  simp only [eval_cons, ← h]
  nth_rw 4 [add_comm]
  simp only [add_assoc]
  congr! 2
  rw [add_comm]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Module/Variantd8cff84370dd580cc8d282816735fb255f42a1f0ca8ec3ded2985bd979a152f7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Module/Variantd8cff84370dd580cc8d282816735fb255f42a1f0ca8ec3ded2985bd979a152f7.lean#L95).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `43836e28bca10b34099d788c97d2f1ae074d6a6d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
