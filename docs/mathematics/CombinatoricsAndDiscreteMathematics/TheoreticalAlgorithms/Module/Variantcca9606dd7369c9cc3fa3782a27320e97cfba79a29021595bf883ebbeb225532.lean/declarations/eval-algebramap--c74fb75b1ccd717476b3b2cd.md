## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0d0e38c0-9a1b-4711-97d6-fdc2435f13c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 205–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-! ### Lists of expressions representing scalars and vectors, and operations on such lists -/

/-- Basic meta-code "normal form" object of the `match_scalars` and `module` tactics: a type synonym
for a list of ordered triples comprising expressions representing terms of two types `R` and `M`
(where typically `M` is an `R`-module), together with a natural number "index".

The natural number represents the index of the `M` term in the `AtomM` monad: this is not enforced,
but is sometimes assumed in operations.  Thus when items `((a₁, x₁), k)` and `((a₂, x₂), k)`
appear in two different `Module.qNF` objects (i.e. with the same `ℕ`-index `k`), it is expected that
the expressions `x₁` and `x₂` are the same.  It is also expected that the items in a `Module.qNF`
list are in strictly increasing order by natural-number index.

By forgetting the natural number indices, an expression representing a `Mathlib.Tactic.Module.NF`
object can be built from a `Module.qNF` object; this construction is provided as
`Mathlib.Tactic.Module.qNF.toNF`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Module/Variantcca9606dd7369c9cc3fa3782a27320e97cfba79a29021595bf883ebbeb225532.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Module/Variantcca9606dd7369c9cc3fa3782a27320e97cfba79a29021595bf883ebbeb225532.lean#L205).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8d15f818aa9f4a5e159709c4f5d2d14c0b7548f6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
