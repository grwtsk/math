## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6bf1089b-e2da-45e8-867a-5c98b87ac14f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 70–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem evaluateTerm_eq_partial (table : FiniteTable) (assignment : List ℕ) (term : Term) :
    evaluateTerm table assignment term =
      evaluatePartial table (fun index => assignment[index]?) term := by
  induction term with
  | «variable» index => rfl
  | nullary constructor => rfl
  | unary constructor argument ih => simp only [evaluateTerm, evaluatePartial, ih]

/-- Overlapping supports are permitted; agreeing on the support preserves the whole readout. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/DerivationSemantics/Variant38904b7e512edc3277c36c6108566bdeba560d5ef31ef3cf702f6f15694ebf48.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/DerivationSemantics/Variant38904b7e512edc3277c36c6108566bdeba560d5ef31ef3cf702f6f15694ebf48.lean#L70).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6b08a4465e706e692df0cdc89450745055189a2a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
