## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9b58c079-9439-6d8b-c6c6-08a1807949ab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 25–38.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_sections {L : List (List α)} {f} : f ∈ sections L ↔ Forall₂ (· ∈ ·) f L := by
  refine ⟨fun h => ?_, fun h => ?_⟩
  · induction L generalizing f
    · cases mem_singleton.1 h
      exact Forall₂.nil
    simp only [sections, mem_flatMap, mem_map] at h
    rcases h with ⟨_, _, _, _, rfl⟩
    simp only [*, forall₂_cons, true_and]
  · induction h with
    | nil => simp only [sections, mem_singleton]
    | @cons a l f L al fL fs =>
      simp only [sections, mem_flatMap, mem_map]
      exact ⟨f, fs, a, al, rfl⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Sections/Variant5c88af95a3eabef5151d12d1732e22b88df74007467fcfdfbd956c2115a10927.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Sections/Variant5c88af95a3eabef5151d12d1732e22b88df74007467fcfdfbd956c2115a10927.lean#L25).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dcb15edd6e8c910604a2051a6645b10c1366d0de` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
