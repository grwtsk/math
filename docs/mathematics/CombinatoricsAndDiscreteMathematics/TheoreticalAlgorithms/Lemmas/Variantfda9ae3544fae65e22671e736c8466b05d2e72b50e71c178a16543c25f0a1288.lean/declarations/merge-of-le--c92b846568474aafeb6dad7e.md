## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:65ac6ce5-5540-f499-2eeb-f0b88aa719f3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 248–259.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem merge_of_le : ∀ {xs ys : List α} (_ : ∀ a b, a ∈ xs → b ∈ ys → le a b),
    merge xs ys le = xs ++ ys
  | [], ys, _
  | xs, [], _ => by simp
  | x :: xs, y :: ys, h => by
    simp only [merge, cons_append]
    rw [if_pos, merge_of_le]
    · intro a b ma mb
      exact h a b (mem_cons_of_mem _ ma) mb
    · exact h x y mem_cons_self mem_cons_self

variable (le) in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Lemmas/Variantfda9ae3544fae65e22671e736c8466b05d2e72b50e71c178a16543c25f0a1288.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Lemmas/Variantfda9ae3544fae65e22671e736c8466b05d2e72b50e71c178a16543c25f0a1288.lean#L248).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `99498d23f57044112348aee23f5bd9ae56d17717` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
