## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bb1041b3-be7a-f883-a98a-4bc41500c173`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2046–2058.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean

    filterMap f xs = ys ++ zs ↔ ∃ as bs, xs = as ++ bs ∧ filterMap f as = ys ∧ filterMap f bs = zs := by
  rcases xs with ⟨xs⟩
  rcases ys with ⟨ys⟩
  rcases zs with ⟨zs⟩
  simp only [List.size_toArray, List.filterMap_toArray', List.append_toArray, mk.injEq,

    exact ⟨⟨l₁⟩, ⟨l₂⟩, by simp⟩
  · rintro ⟨⟨l₁⟩, ⟨l₂⟩, rfl, h₁, h₂⟩
    exact ⟨l₁, l₂, by simp_all⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Lemmas/Variantd3d343ae6aec3ee4de41c7008e4391a923befa309428a5aea8681e6c47f32721.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Lemmas/Variantd3d343ae6aec3ee4de41c7008e4391a923befa309428a5aea8681e6c47f32721.lean#L2046).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d394abc85a852644392157668b505932dd3f7780` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
