## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:be415775-cbdc-863e-4f3c-69ea7d57d399`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 4374–4380.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sum_push [Add α] [Zero α] [Std.Associative (α := α) (· + ·)]
    [Std.LawfulIdentity (· + ·) (0 : α)] {xs : Array α} {x : α} :
    (xs.push x).sum = xs.sum + x := by
  simp [Array.sum_eq_foldr, Std.LawfulRightIdentity.right_id, Std.LawfulLeftIdentity.left_id,
    ← Array.foldr_assoc]

@[simp, grind =]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Lemmas/Variant42cd34d2049c71159ee756a717b9fa863a973458d8a6dfa152d9c601fa09fc5d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Lemmas/Variant42cd34d2049c71159ee756a717b9fa863a973458d8a6dfa152d9c601fa09fc5d.lean#L4374).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1812a095ab5e84d89a8d03a9f40790d49e3e697d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
