## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4891287646c7a010db7b2ca47fa4a93a7ded1b5d8722670075483222fec2a24e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1347–1352.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def reduce.churchRosser (H12 : Red L₁ L₂) (H13 : Red L₁ L₃) : { L₄ // Red L₂ L₄ ∧ Red L₃ L₄ } :=
  ⟨reduce L₁, reduce.rev H12, reduce.rev H13⟩
#align free_group.reduce.church_rosser FreeGroup.reduce.churchRosser
#align free_add_group.reduce.church_rosser FreeAddGroup.reduce.churchRosser

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/FreeGroup/Variant603ca58b17744ea5f37776a5fb98911bbe14fcb57387ce259ae100a152db33ea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/FreeGroup/Variant603ca58b17744ea5f37776a5fb98911bbe14fcb57387ce259ae100a152db33ea.lean#L1347).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a00d3e82087a4f14eece8b32b9c6fbdb7cb8c545` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
