## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:86a57575-5b0c-cebc-837b-0ce07f75ad24`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 122–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem untrop_sum [ConditionallyCompleteLinearOrder R] [Fintype S] (f : S → Tropical (WithTop R)) :
    untrop (∑ i : S, f i) = ⨅ i : S, untrop (f i) := by
  rw [iInf, ← Set.image_univ, ← coe_univ, untrop_sum_eq_sInf_image, Function.comp_def]

/-- Note we cannot use `i ∈ s` instead of `i : s` here
as it is simply not true on conditionally complete lattices! -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/BigOperators/Variantacbbfb068c36310da69d6fdb7999acb838314743b238f3000d31495632251e84.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/BigOperators/Variantacbbfb068c36310da69d6fdb7999acb838314743b238f3000d31495632251e84.lean#L122).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `af7a5564a032616928e72c0cd3b82a1ca70c38b8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
