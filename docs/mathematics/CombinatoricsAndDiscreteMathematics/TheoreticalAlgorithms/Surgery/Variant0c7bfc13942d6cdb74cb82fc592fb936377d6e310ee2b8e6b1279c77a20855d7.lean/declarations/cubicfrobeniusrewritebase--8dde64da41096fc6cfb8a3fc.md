## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a757d4b32e48eb5f19f36f124f88bfb3e8f504fb74b022317da53c7d6508e0d8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 49–69.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure CubicFrobeniusRewriteBase
    (N : ℕ) (A : Type*) [CommRing A] where
  delta : A → A
  frobenius : A →+* A
  frobenius_formula : ∀ value,
    frobenius value = value ^ 3 + (3 : A) * delta value
  universalCoefficient : PacketAtom N → A
  realization : A →+* ℂ
  realizesCoefficient : ∀ atom,
    realization (universalCoefficient atom) = coefficientSection atom
  realization_frobenius : ∀ value,
    realization (frobenius value) = realization value

/-- Canonical adapter from the checked Vaughan delta-operation base.

The universal value of `(m,k)` is exactly `-(L_m * R_k)`.  This adapter
connects algebraic normalization to the finite surgery state without
importing a legacy prismatic namespace or changing the meaning of the
complex realization.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Surgery/Variant0c7bfc13942d6cdb74cb82fc592fb936377d6e310ee2b8e6b1279c77a20855d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Surgery/Variant0c7bfc13942d6cdb74cb82fc592fb936377d6e310ee2b8e6b1279c77a20855d7.lean#L49).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3e74d047585d8ec928452a0b2a9675bee1063b29` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
