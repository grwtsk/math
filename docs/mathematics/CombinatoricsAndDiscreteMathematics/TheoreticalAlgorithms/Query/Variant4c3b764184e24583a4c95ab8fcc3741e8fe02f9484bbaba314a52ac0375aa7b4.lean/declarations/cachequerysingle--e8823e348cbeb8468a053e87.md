## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:afb0d30002d8f602afca789cff8f85cd7c59a8a32f60b423bdf175e1c529afb5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 173–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def cacheQuerySingle (repo sha : String) : IO Unit := do
  if isCanonicalRepo repo then
    IO.eprintln s!"{repo} caches by file hash, not per commit, so there is no per-commit build to query."
    (← IO.getStderr).flush
    IO.Process.exit 1
  let cached ← probeContainerForSHA Container.forks repo sha
  if cached then
    IO.println s!"cached: {sha}"
  else
    IO.println s!"not cached: {sha}"
    (← IO.getStdout).flush
    IO.Process.exit 1

/--
Implement the `cache query` subcommand.

Walks git log backwards from HEAD, stopping at the merge base with `master`
(or a hard cap if the merge base is not reachable), and probes each commit's
SHA-scoped namespace to find the most recent commit that has cache entries.

This is a diagnostic-only command: it prints the SHA to stdout but does not
auto-apply it. The user manually passes the result to `cache get` if desired.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Query/Variant4c3b764184e24583a4c95ab8fcc3741e8fe02f9484bbaba314a52ac0375aa7b4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Query/Variant4c3b764184e24583a4c95ab8fcc3741e8fe02f9484bbaba314a52ac0375aa7b4.lean#L173).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4ac66d54a1d47eb3b247ef9ff110438523a99758` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
