## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0e8d4e23819cb9ec686be215d8d2b7dc4ce4cf40dc29b46d0df3d45cf3fed691`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 109–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def defaultUnsafeSHAWindow : Nat := 1

/--
Walk a list of SHAs (most recent first) and collect up to `limit` of them whose
per-SHA marker exists in the `forks` container. Stops early once `limit` are
found, so at most `limit` probes succeed (and at most `shas.length` are made).

`forks` is the only SHA-scoped container; master/nightly-testing/pr-toolchain-tests
are not scoped, so probing them here would be meaningless.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Query/Variant4c3b764184e24583a4c95ab8fcc3741e8fe02f9484bbaba314a52ac0375aa7b4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Query/Variant4c3b764184e24583a4c95ab8fcc3741e8fe02f9484bbaba314a52ac0375aa7b4.lean#L109).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4ac66d54a1d47eb3b247ef9ff110438523a99758` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
