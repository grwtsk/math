## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:67918db259f3dd753540fe50df99205923335bce2f879848a89ab98c02d281fa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 53–62.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[inline, expose] def Array.setIfInBounds (xs : Array α) (i : Nat) (v : α) : Array α :=
  dite (LT.lt i xs.size) (fun h => xs.set i v h) (fun _ => xs)

/--
Set an element in an array, or panic if the index is out of bounds.

This will perform the update destructively provided that `a` has a reference
count of 1 when called.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Set/Variantbac98ce0721c0a900e7daa88275329c41129177a0fc22c7f13534e2ddab984d6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Set/Variantbac98ce0721c0a900e7daa88275329c41129177a0fc22c7f13534e2ddab984d6.lean#L53).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0926a038a47ad19fcde86b490b1528f3bd8c7337` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
