## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1180b4e8-e1f4-f657-83fd-40182b34d08d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 705–711.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma castSucc_succAbove_castSucc {n : ℕ} {i : Fin (n + 1)} {j : Fin n} :
    i.castSucc.succAbove j.castSucc = (i.succAbove j).castSucc := by
  rcases i.le_or_gt (castSucc j) with (h | h)
  · rw [succAbove_of_le_castSucc _ _ h, succAbove_castSucc_of_le _ _ h, succ_castSucc]
  · rw [succAbove_of_castSucc_lt _ _ h, succAbove_castSucc_of_lt _ _ h]

/-- `pred` commutes with `succAbove`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/SuccPred/Varianta1dfe91471700d916a374242daf93570b4e96e5d1fb333070283277d8a3a9895.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/SuccPred/Varianta1dfe91471700d916a374242daf93570b4e96e5d1fb333070283277d8a3a9895.lean#L705).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5486f27ace594898edd57d48ae58c0065cceb12c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
