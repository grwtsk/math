## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b263d60bd00d678323df1f58f20b4ff29c04b3b0475d2f229d90e431173742bb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 838–862.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def expandDownloadRounds (containerURLs : List (Option Container × String))
    (scope? : Option String) (unsafeScopes : List String)
    (headScope? : Option String := none) :
    List (Option Container × String × Option String) :=
  if unsafeScopes.isEmpty then
    containerURLs.map fun (c, url) =>
      if c == some Container.forks then (c, url, scope? <|> headScope?)
      else (c, url, scope?)
  else
    containerURLs.flatMap fun (c, url) =>
      if c == some Container.forks then
        unsafeScopes.map fun sha => (c, url, some sha)
      else
        [(c, url, none)]

/-- Call `curl` to download files from the server to `CACHEDIR` (`.cache`).
Return the number of files which failed to download.
If `decompress` is true, decompresses files as they're downloaded (pipelined).

For each repo, the tool tries the trust-ordered container list returned by
`effectiveGetURLs`. After each container round, files that were successfully
fetched are filtered out so the next container only retries genuine misses.

`unsafeScopes` is the list of SHA scopes discovered by `cache get --unsafe`
(empty for a normal read); see `expandDownloadRounds`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Requests/Variantbf2fc8f305b34526862798e3bc5a5ee88e412fe7f5e22b742b285359d4844764.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Requests/Variantbf2fc8f305b34526862798e3bc5a5ee88e412fe7f5e22b742b285359d4844764.lean#L838).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b1bccf23b6211eb834b69b0220b8949534ec8f48` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
