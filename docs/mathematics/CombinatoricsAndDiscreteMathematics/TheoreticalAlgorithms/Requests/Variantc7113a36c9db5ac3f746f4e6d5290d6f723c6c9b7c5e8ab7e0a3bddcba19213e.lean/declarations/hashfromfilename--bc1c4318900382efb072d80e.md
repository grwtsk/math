## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4a7f319d1688a2faa2a4ccd5c879cafbb1674cb4e0850a7905073964dbdf5c04`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 554–561.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def hashFromFileName (path : FilePath) : Option UInt64 :=
  let peel (name : String) := (FilePath.mk name).fileStem.getD name
  let name := path.fileName.getD path.toString
  -- Peel one extension at a time — `.part`, this process's tag, `.ltar` — and take the first stem
  -- that parses as a hash, so all three shapes above resolve without knowing which one this is.
  [name, peel name, peel (peel name), peel (peel (peel name))].findSome? String.parseHexToUInt64?

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Requests/Variantc7113a36c9db5ac3f746f4e6d5290d6f723c6c9b7c5e8ab7e0a3bddcba19213e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Requests/Variantc7113a36c9db5ac3f746f4e6d5290d6f723c6c9b7c5e8ab7e0a3bddcba19213e.lean#L554).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dd81bd18c951748911d7ae56289c5ec095f0c087` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
