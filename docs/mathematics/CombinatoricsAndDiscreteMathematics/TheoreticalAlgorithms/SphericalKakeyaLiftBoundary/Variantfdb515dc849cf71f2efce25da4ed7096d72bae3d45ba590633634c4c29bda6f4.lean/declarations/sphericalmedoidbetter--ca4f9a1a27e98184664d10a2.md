## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ae52a4695ef345d4e9e6e057ba0a0afd274ca58ce37a0fc46c5939f5a5bbab28`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 240–251.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def sphericalMedoidBetter
    (sites : List SphericalLiftedSite)
    (left right : SphericalLiftedSite) : Bool :=
  let leftObjective := sphericalMedoidObjective sites left
  let rightObjective := sphericalMedoidObjective sites right
  if leftObjective < rightObjective then
    true
  else if rightObjective < leftObjective then
    false
  else
    left.sourceSite.branchNumerator <= right.sourceSite.branchNumerator

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/SphericalKakeyaLiftBoundary/Variantfdb515dc849cf71f2efce25da4ed7096d72bae3d45ba590633634c4c29bda6f4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/SphericalKakeyaLiftBoundary/Variantfdb515dc849cf71f2efce25da4ed7096d72bae3d45ba590633634c4c29bda6f4.lean#L240).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `15712ec73c7da2bf44a4f95c367dbd67a0c86ff6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
