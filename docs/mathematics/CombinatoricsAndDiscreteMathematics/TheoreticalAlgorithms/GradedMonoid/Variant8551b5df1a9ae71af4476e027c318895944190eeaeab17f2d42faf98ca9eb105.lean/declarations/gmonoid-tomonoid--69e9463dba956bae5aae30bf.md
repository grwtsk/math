## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b7b46fb391c4116f5ede88b642037388d045aa9509fea69cb6e8f30b35cf4808`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 199–210.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance GMonoid.toMonoid [AddMonoid ι] [GMonoid A] : Monoid (GradedMonoid A)
    where
  one := 1
  mul := (· * ·)
  npow n a := GradedMonoid.mk _ (GMonoid.gnpow n a.snd)
  npow_zero a := GMonoid.gnpow_zero' a
  npow_succ n a := GMonoid.gnpow_succ' n a
  one_mul := GMonoid.one_mul
  mul_one := GMonoid.mul_one
  mul_assoc := GMonoid.mul_assoc
#align graded_monoid.gmonoid.to_monoid GradedMonoid.GMonoid.toMonoid

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/GradedMonoid/Variant8551b5df1a9ae71af4476e027c318895944190eeaeab17f2d42faf98ca9eb105.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/GradedMonoid/Variant8551b5df1a9ae71af4476e027c318895944190eeaeab17f2d42faf98ca9eb105.lean#L199).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d6a6a531f464a5d7c9d0e0bebeec478d0d7dd556` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
