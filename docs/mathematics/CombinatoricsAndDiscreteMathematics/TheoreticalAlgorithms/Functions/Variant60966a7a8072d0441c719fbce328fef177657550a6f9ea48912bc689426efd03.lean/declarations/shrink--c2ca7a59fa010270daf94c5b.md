## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e1036bf8812d58bbf08be9cb33e7d8c90104dd38c060990179fd603d48c7bd6f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 319–331.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def shrink {α : Type} [DecidableEq α] :
    InjectiveFunction α → List (InjectiveFunction α)
  | ⟨_, h₀, h₁⟩ => do
    let ⟨xs', ys', h₀, h₁⟩ ← InjectiveFunction.shrinkPerm ⟨_, _, h₀, h₁⟩
    have h₃ : xs'.length ≤ ys'.length := le_of_eq (List.Perm.length_eq h₀)
    have h₄ : ys'.length ≤ xs'.length := le_of_eq (List.Perm.length_eq h₀.symm)
    pure
      ⟨(List.zip xs' ys').map Prod.toSigma,
        by simp only [comp_def, List.map_fst_zip, List.map_snd_zip, *, Prod.fst_toSigma,
          Prod.snd_toSigma, List.map_map],
        by simp only [comp_def, List.map_snd_zip, *, Prod.snd_toSigma, List.map_map]⟩

/-- Create an injective function from one list and a permutation of that list. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Functions/Variant60966a7a8072d0441c719fbce328fef177657550a6f9ea48912bc689426efd03.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Functions/Variant60966a7a8072d0441c719fbce328fef177657550a6f9ea48912bc689426efd03.lean#L319).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `36046a297dc7d6c498c9c3b851fb473f7714c06b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
