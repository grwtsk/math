## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:76569ee30bc5f5ad67d00adfb4db4c4da1ce0a2b9ab7ae4810a4021c8c423917`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 293–305.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def sliceSizes : ℕ → MLList Id ℕ+
  | n =>
    if h : 0 < n then
      have : n / 2 < n := Nat.div_lt_self h (by decide : 1 < 2)
      .cons ⟨_, h⟩ (sliceSizes <| n / 2)
    else .nil

/-- Shrink a permutation of a list, slicing a segment in the middle.

The sizes of the slice being removed start at `n` (with `n` the length
of the list) and then `n / 2`, then `n / 4`, etc down to 1. The slices
will be taken at index `0`, `n / k`, `2n / k`, `3n / k`, etc.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Functions/Variant60966a7a8072d0441c719fbce328fef177657550a6f9ea48912bc689426efd03.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Functions/Variant60966a7a8072d0441c719fbce328fef177657550a6f9ea48912bc689426efd03.lean#L293).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `36046a297dc7d6c498c9c3b851fb473f7714c06b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
