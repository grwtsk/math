## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b8aba2da-36f7-5b39-9cd3-b21357059ac4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 372–381.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma exists_length_eq_one_iff {u v : V} : (∃ (p : G.Walk u v), p.length = 1) ↔ G.Adj u v := by
  refine ⟨?_, fun h ↦ ⟨h.toWalk, by simp⟩⟩
  rintro ⟨p , hp⟩
  induction p with
  | nil => simp only [Walk.length_nil, zero_ne_one] at hp
  | cons h p' =>
    simp only [Walk.length_cons, add_eq_right] at hp
    exact (p'.eq_of_length_eq_zero hp) ▸ h

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Walk/Variantd816791aaeac6b28f6975acd932e19f8c6ac120af451c633dffa60dbf791efff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Walk/Variantd816791aaeac6b28f6975acd932e19f8c6ac120af451c633dffa60dbf791efff.lean#L372).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e13256d3741c0138802880d961077409f7ed83df` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
