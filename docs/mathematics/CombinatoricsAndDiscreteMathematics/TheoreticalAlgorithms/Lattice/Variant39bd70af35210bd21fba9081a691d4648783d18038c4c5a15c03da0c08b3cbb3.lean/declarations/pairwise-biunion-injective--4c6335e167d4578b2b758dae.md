## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:60048755-da18-7ceb-5a79-0e698c16f118`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 167–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Pairwise.biUnion_injective (h₀ : Pairwise (Disjoint on f)) (h₁ : ∀ i, (f i).Nonempty) :
    Injective fun s : Set ι => ⋃ i ∈ s, f i := fun _s _t h =>
  ((h₀.subset_of_biUnion_subset_biUnion fun _ _ => h₁ _) <| h.subset).antisymm <|
    (h₀.subset_of_biUnion_subset_biUnion fun _ _ => h₁ _) <| h.superset

/-- In a disjoint union we can identify the unique set an element belongs to. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Lattice/Variant39bd70af35210bd21fba9081a691d4648783d18038c4c5a15c03da0c08b3cbb3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Lattice/Variant39bd70af35210bd21fba9081a691d4648783d18038c4c5a15c03da0c08b3cbb3.lean#L167).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e7dc5d5c3e8f0432f3196a3ffa68ac42848b3e69` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
