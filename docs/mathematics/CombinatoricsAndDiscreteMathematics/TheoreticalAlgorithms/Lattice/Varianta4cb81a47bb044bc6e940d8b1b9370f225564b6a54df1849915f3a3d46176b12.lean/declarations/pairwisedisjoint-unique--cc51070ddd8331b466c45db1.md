## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e98de1fd-77f1-73ca-cccf-9ae579e747b7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 206–214.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pairwiseDisjoint_unique {y : α}
    (h_disjoint : PairwiseDisjoint s f)
    (hy : y ∈ (⋃ i ∈ s, f i)) : ∃! i, i ∈ s ∧ y ∈ f i := by
  refine existsUnique_of_exists_of_unique ?ex ?unique
  · simpa only [mem_iUnion, exists_prop] using hy
  · rintro i j ⟨his, hi⟩ ⟨hjs, hj⟩
    exact h_disjoint.elim his hjs <| not_disjoint_iff.mpr ⟨y, ⟨hi, hj⟩⟩

end
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Lattice/Varianta4cb81a47bb044bc6e940d8b1b9370f225564b6a54df1849915f3a3d46176b12.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Lattice/Varianta4cb81a47bb044bc6e940d8b1b9370f225564b6a54df1849915f3a3d46176b12.lean#L206).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f7f115ddafdb7fb80ac066cd241189b5f9af9d71` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
