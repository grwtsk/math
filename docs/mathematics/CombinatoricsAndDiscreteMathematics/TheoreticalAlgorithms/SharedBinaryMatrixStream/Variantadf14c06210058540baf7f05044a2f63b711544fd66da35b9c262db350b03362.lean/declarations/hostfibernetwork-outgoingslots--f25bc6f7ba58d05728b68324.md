## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:94f660ead29b89df4d6cc5f8f6de72cacb8622355a5a74ece790702ec3751586`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 422–429.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[expose] def HostFiberNetwork.outgoingSlots {hostCount edgeSlots : Nat}
    (network : HostFiberNetwork hostCount edgeSlots)
    (source : Fin hostCount) : List (Fin edgeSlots) :=
  (List.finRange edgeSlots).filter fun slot ↦
    (network.fibers source slot).enabled

/-- Select exactly one outgoing fiber by the tension rank, or `none` when the
host has no enabled fiber.  `List.argmax` is executable and deterministic. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/SharedBinaryMatrixStream/Variantadf14c06210058540baf7f05044a2f63b711544fd66da35b9c262db350b03362.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/SharedBinaryMatrixStream/Variantadf14c06210058540baf7f05044a2f63b711544fd66da35b9c262db350b03362.lean#L422).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ea599239c79a6aa763990712170c5de2d866e056` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
