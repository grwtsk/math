## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:46a019f4-d2fc-7768-1c35-d5004513e3f0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 126–138.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem prev_induction {s : Slice} {C : s.Pos → Prop} (p : s.Pos)
    (prev : ∀ (x : s.Pos), (h : x ≠ s.startPos) → C (x.prev h) → C x) (startPos : C s.startPos) :
    C p := by
  induction p using WellFounded.induction wellFounded_lt with | h p ih
  by_cases h : p = s.startPos
  · simpa [h]
  · exact prev _ h (ih _ (by simp))

end Slice.Pos

namespace Pos

/-- The number of bytes between `p` and the end position. This number decreases as `p` advances. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Termination/Variant97336484b72c0a568ee0b98269919a192f545c6fe4fb1dfa82f7552ac61a9193.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Termination/Variant97336484b72c0a568ee0b98269919a192f545c6fe4fb1dfa82f7552ac61a9193.lean#L126).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ce81cd7cd41adfbd173dd5df1f9b6bf018b5b3b4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
