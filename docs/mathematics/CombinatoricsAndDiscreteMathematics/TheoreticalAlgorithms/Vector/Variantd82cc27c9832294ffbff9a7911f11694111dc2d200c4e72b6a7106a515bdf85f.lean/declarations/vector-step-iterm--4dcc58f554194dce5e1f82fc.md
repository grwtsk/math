## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8e3cc8fb-cd2a-48f0-7c2b-21232a6604a2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 92–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Vector.step_iterM {xs : Vector β n} :
    (xs.iterM m).step = (pure <| .deflate <| if h : 0 < n then
        .yield
          (xs.iterFromIdxM m 1)
          xs[0]
          (Vector.isPlausibleStep_iterM_of_pos h)
      else
        .done (Vector.isPlausibleStep_iterM_of_not_pos h)) := by
  simp [← Vector.iterFromIdxM_toArray, ← Vector.iterM_toArray, Array.step_iterM]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Vector/Variantd82cc27c9832294ffbff9a7911f11694111dc2d200c4e72b6a7106a515bdf85f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Vector/Variantd82cc27c9832294ffbff9a7911f11694111dc2d200c4e72b6a7106a515bdf85f.lean#L92).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f1680bae090571eeeb4ea745a2ce23e5f37cf200` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
