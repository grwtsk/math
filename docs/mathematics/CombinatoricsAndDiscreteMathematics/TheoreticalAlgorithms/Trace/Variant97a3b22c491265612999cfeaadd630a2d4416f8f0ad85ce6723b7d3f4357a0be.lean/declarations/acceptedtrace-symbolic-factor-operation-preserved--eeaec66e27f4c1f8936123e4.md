## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4f69b6e0-9f84-c4fd-b774-a43553ec8e52`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1131–1148.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

      trace.factor.reconstruct = trace.gram ∧
      ∀ left right,
        trace.factor.symbolicInner left right =
          trace.factor.reconstructEntry left right := by
  obtain ⟨trace, decoded, conditions⟩ := accepted

    unfold AcceptanceConditions at conditions

    trace.factor.symbolicInner_eq_reconstructEntry⟩

/-- Accepted foreign bytes therefore carry an exact symbolic Gram-factor
certificate, rather than merely a factor digest or a finite test vector. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Trace/Variant97a3b22c491265612999cfeaadd630a2d4416f8f0ad85ce6723b7d3f4357a0be.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Trace/Variant97a3b22c491265612999cfeaadd630a2d4416f8f0ad85ce6723b7d3f4357a0be.lean#L1131).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `712d1f5bbead423413b1ce63df8a5673b7c33af6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
