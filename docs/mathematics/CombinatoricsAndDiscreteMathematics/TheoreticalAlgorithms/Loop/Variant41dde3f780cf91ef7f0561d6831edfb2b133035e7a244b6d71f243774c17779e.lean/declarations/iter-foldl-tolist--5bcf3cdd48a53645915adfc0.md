## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2a6626f3-0afa-1d76-5328-098014498d51`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 461–467.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Iter.foldl_toList {α β : Type w} {γ : Type x} [Iterator α Id β] [Finite α Id]
    [IteratorLoop α Id Id] [LawfulIteratorLoop α Id Id]
    {f : γ → β → γ} {init : γ} {it : Iter (α := α) β} :
    it.toList.foldl (init := init) f = it.fold (init := init) f := by
  rw [fold_eq_foldM, List.foldl_eq_foldlM, ← Iter.foldlM_toList]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Loop/Variant41dde3f780cf91ef7f0561d6831edfb2b133035e7a244b6d71f243774c17779e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Loop/Variant41dde3f780cf91ef7f0561d6831edfb2b133035e7a244b6d71f243774c17779e.lean#L461).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a554251c59f45781c3037de3033e14a5093aea5b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
