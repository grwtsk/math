## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5db146ad-61c4-bb47-b56c-82988fd6e427`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 184–199.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_most_significant_bit {n : ℕ} (h : n ≠ 0) :
    ∃ i, testBit n i = true ∧ ∀ j, i < j → testBit n j = false := by
  induction n using Nat.binaryRec with | zero => exact False.elim (h rfl) | bit b n hn => ?_
  by_cases h' : n = 0
  · subst h'
    rw [show b = true by
        revert h
        cases b <;> simp]
    refine ⟨0, ⟨by rw [testBit_bit_zero], fun j hj => ?_⟩⟩
    obtain ⟨j', rfl⟩ := exists_eq_succ_of_ne_zero (ne_of_gt hj)
    rw [testBit_bit_succ, zero_testBit]
  · obtain ⟨k, ⟨hk, hk'⟩⟩ := hn h'
    refine ⟨k + 1, ⟨by rw [testBit_bit_succ, hk], fun j hj => ?_⟩⟩
    obtain ⟨j', rfl⟩ := exists_eq_succ_of_ne_zero (show j ≠ 0 by intro x; subst x; simp at hj)
    exact (testBit_bit_succ _ _ _).trans (hk' _ (lt_of_succ_lt_succ hj))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Bitwise/Variant1b69b2e6fd961b82176e07b32cce89dfce1c877c07977c74cd7f06ae8d9a7c3b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Bitwise/Variant1b69b2e6fd961b82176e07b32cce89dfce1c877c07977c74cd7f06ae8d9a7c3b.lean#L184).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b877792c66387f5c0e52b31d1cdeedb3c4357626` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
