## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0e6e65ae-7132-bed4-bb28-d89370b47d81`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 153–174.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ge_two_pow_implies_high_bit_true {x : Nat} (p : x ≥ 2^n) : ∃ i, i ≥ n ∧ testBit x i := by
  induction x using div2Induction generalizing n with
  | ind x hyp =>
    have x_pos : x > 0 := Nat.lt_of_lt_of_le (Nat.pow_two_pos n) p
    have x_ne_zero : x ≠ 0 := Nat.ne_of_gt x_pos
    match n with
    | zero =>
      let ⟨j, jp⟩ := ne_zero_implies_bit_true x_ne_zero
      exact Exists.intro j (And.intro (Nat.zero_le _) jp)
    | succ n =>
      have x_ge_n : x / 2 ≥ 2 ^ n := by
          simp [le_div_iff_mul_le, ← Nat.pow_succ']
          exact p
      have ⟨j, jp⟩ := @hyp x_pos n x_ge_n
      apply Exists.intro (j+1)
      apply And.intro
      case left =>
        exact (Nat.succ_le_succ jp.left)
      case right =>
        simp [testBit_succ_div2 _ j]
        exact jp.right

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Bitwise/Variantd7a066fd0a96837f0fbef8cbf8a8a1530ee3c431cd9feeadb83b044f45c9ca6a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Bitwise/Variantd7a066fd0a96837f0fbef8cbf8a8a1530ee3c431cd9feeadb83b044f45c9ca6a.lean#L153).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c8cfa3dfcbf276ddf03efa3d4cca96631acafe1f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
