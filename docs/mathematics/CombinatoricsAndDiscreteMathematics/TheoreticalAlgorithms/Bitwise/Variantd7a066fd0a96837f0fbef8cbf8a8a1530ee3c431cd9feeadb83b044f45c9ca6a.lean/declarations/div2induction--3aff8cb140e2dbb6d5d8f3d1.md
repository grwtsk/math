## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d89ceb1ea68c9ca5690b12244d70ed9c802bc74ab6b660269bbd52876f23865c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 48–59.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def div2Induction {motive : Nat → Sort u}
    (n : Nat) (ind : ∀(n : Nat), (n > 0 → motive (n/2)) → motive n) : motive n := by
  induction n using Nat.strongInductionOn with
  | ind n hyp =>
    apply ind
    intro n_pos
    if n_eq : n = 0 then
      simp [n_eq] at n_pos
    else
      apply hyp
      exact Nat.div_lt_self n_pos (Nat.le_refl _)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Bitwise/Variantd7a066fd0a96837f0fbef8cbf8a8a1530ee3c431cd9feeadb83b044f45c9ca6a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Bitwise/Variantd7a066fd0a96837f0fbef8cbf8a8a1530ee3c431cd9feeadb83b044f45c9ca6a.lean#L48).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c8cfa3dfcbf276ddf03efa3d4cca96631acafe1f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
