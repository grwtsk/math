## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:92b8a26b-cc79-e39b-5f31-857c05850618`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 286–303.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] theorem Tree.eval_toSOP_tree
    (ν : Valuation α)
    (p : Tree α) :
    Tree.eval ν (SumOfProducts.toTree (Tree.toSOP p)) = Tree.eval ν p := by
  rw [SumOfProducts.eval_toTree, Tree.eval_toSOP]

/--
A PLA-style Sum-of-Products matrix.

Rows are AND-product terms. Columns are variables. Since SOP needs positive and
negative literals, the representation uses two Boolean matrices:

* `pos r v = 1` means product row `r` contains variable `v`;
* `neg r v = 1` means product row `r` contains negated variable `¬v`.

The Boolean tree is recovered by ANDing literals across each row and ORing the
rows at the root.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/SOP/Varianta0ab27c97d2e4c38e79852bc0ea787cd590e6048caccc7647168dc11b557e9bc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/SOP/Varianta0ab27c97d2e4c38e79852bc0ea787cd590e6048caccc7647168dc11b557e9bc.lean#L286).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8054c9167d370773e6b4fcf26d7388de71eb6153` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
