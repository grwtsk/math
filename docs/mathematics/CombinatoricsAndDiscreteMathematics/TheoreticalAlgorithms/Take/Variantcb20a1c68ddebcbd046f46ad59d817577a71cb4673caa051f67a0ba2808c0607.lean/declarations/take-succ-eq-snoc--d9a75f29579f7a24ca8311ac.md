## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:397cab6c-8fad-c8a5-c47a-901158f7a7fe`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 83–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem take_succ_eq_snoc (m : ℕ) (h : m < n) (v : (i : Fin n) → α i) :
    take m.succ h v = snoc (take m h.le v) (v ⟨m, h⟩) := by
  ext i
  induction m with
  | zero =>
    have h' : i = 0 := by ext; simp
    subst h'
    simp [take, snoc, castLE]
  | succ m _ =>
    induction i using reverseInduction with
    | last => simp [take, snoc, castLT]; congr
    | cast i _ => simp [snoc_cast_add]

/-- `take` commutes with `update` for indices in the range of `take`. -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Take/Variantcb20a1c68ddebcbd046f46ad59d817577a71cb4673caa051f67a0ba2808c0607.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Take/Variantcb20a1c68ddebcbd046f46ad59d817577a71cb4673caa051f67a0ba2808c0607.lean#L83).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4bcc8446a20c904cd29804398f9dd605529d9ad9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
