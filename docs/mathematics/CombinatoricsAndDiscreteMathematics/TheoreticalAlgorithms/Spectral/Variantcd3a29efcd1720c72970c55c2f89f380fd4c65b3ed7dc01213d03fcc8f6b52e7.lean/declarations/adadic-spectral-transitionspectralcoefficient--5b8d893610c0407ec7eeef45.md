## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0c6a0da93e2bbe3de66d0391bb2b973f151c7bdd482b3883265a575145eef289`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 181–191.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Adadic.Spectral.transitionSpectralCoefficient
    {n : Nat}
    (N : Cube.BooleanNetwork.Network n)
    (S T : Fin (2 ^ n)) :
    Adadic.Spectral.Dyadic :=
  Adadic.Spectral.matrixSpectralCoefficient
    (Cube.BooleanNetwork.transitionMatrix N)
    S
    T

/-- Full spectral transform of a Boolean-network transition matrix. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Spectral/Variantcd3a29efcd1720c72970c55c2f89f380fd4c65b3ed7dc01213d03fcc8f6b52e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Spectral/Variantcd3a29efcd1720c72970c55c2f89f380fd4c65b3ed7dc01213d03fcc8f6b52e7.lean#L181).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e66bd98c034a1410e9d9ab8920a1fb3b07092d21` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
