## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6389d386-2439-cf78-6b08-e7efe790a4c0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 173–188.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_forwardInterval {net : SequentialNet} {xs : List ℝ} {Is : IntervalVector}
    (hdim : xs.length = Is.length)
    (hwf : WellFormed net xs.length)
    (hmem : ∀ i (hi : i < Is.length), xs[i]'(hdim ▸ hi) ∈ Is[i]'hi)
    (prec : Int) (hprec : prec ≤ 0 := by norm_num) :
    let outReal := forwardReal net xs
    let outInt := forwardInterval net Is prec
    outReal.length = outInt.length ∧
    ∀ i (hi : i < outInt.length), outReal[i]'((forwardLength_aux net.layers xs Is hdim hwf prec) ▸ hi) ∈ outInt[i]'hi :=
  ⟨forwardLength_aux net.layers xs Is hdim hwf prec, mem_forwardInterval_aux net.layers xs Is hdim hwf hmem prec hprec⟩

end SequentialNet

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Distillation/Variant32b8a4872311713dc29c6ef55d258a36d7e436f7299c43d283e55aa63476da8f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Distillation/Variant32b8a4872311713dc29c6ef55d258a36d7e436f7299c43d283e55aa63476da8f.lean#L173).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `58d40cf8b4e8fe6710437fe57ce0dac4a499ed75` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
