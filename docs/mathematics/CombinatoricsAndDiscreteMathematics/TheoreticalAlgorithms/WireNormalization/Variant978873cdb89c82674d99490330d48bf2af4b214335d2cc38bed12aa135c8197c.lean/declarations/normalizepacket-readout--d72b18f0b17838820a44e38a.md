## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c4b2559-3eaa-c98f-f908-ed5617c6ec83`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 143–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem normalizePacket_readout (checked : CheckedPacket) (assignment : List ℕ)
    (valid : TagAssignmentValid assignment) :
    evaluateTerm FullFixtures.interpreterTable assignment (normalizePacket checked).payload.decode =
      evaluateTerm FullFixtures.interpreterTable assignment checked.packet.payload.decode := by
  simp only [normalizePacket, decode_encode]
  exact tag_normalize_preserves_evaluation _ assignment valid

/-- Concrete raw packet encoding the licensed double-tag reduction fixture. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/WireNormalization/Variant978873cdb89c82674d99490330d48bf2af4b214335d2cc38bed12aa135c8197c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/WireNormalization/Variant978873cdb89c82674d99490330d48bf2af4b214335d2cc38bed12aa135c8197c.lean#L143).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1b6c7664d791efd334c0e449b0e34082c43369a7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
