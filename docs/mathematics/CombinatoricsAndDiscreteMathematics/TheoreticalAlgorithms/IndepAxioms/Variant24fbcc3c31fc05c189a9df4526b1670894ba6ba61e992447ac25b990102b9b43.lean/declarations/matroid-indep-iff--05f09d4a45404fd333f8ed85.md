## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d98fa2d4-6bd2-895a-fcb1-92b1743d44a7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–170.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] theorem matroid_indep_iff {M : IndepMatroid α} {I : Set α} :
    M.matroid.Indep I ↔ M.Indep I := Iff.rfl

/-- If `Indep` has the 'compactness' property that each set `I` satisfies `Indep I` if and only if
`Indep J` for every finite subset `J` of `I`,
then an `IndepMatroid` can be constructed without proving the maximality axiom.
This needs choice, since it can be used to prove that every vector space has a basis. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/IndepAxioms/Variant24fbcc3c31fc05c189a9df4526b1670894ba6ba61e992447ac25b990102b9b43.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/IndepAxioms/Variant24fbcc3c31fc05c189a9df4526b1670894ba6ba61e992447ac25b990102b9b43.lean#L164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6709a937797d5763a647c6ef29537e0e3261628c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
