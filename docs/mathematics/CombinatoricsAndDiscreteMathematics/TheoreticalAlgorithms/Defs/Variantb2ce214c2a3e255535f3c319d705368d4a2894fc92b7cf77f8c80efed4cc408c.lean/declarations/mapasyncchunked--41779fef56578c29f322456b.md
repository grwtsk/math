## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d490de973b5c139e93862c2c84e0b9efbf2ce61cc0b1642b316ad3df60337ff0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 381–394.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mapAsyncChunked {α β} (f : α → β) (xs : List α) (chunk_size := 1024) : List β :=
  ((xs.toChunks chunk_size).map fun xs => Task.spawn fun _ => List.map f xs).flatMap Task.get


/-!
We add some n-ary versions of `List.zipWith` for functions with more than two arguments.
These can also be written in terms of `List.zip` or `List.zipWith`.
For example, `zipWith3 f xs ys zs` could also be written as
`zipWith id (zipWith f xs ys) zs`
or as
`(zip xs <| zip ys zs).map <| fun ⟨x, y, z⟩ ↦ f x y z`.
-/

/-- Ternary version of `List.zipWith`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variantb2ce214c2a3e255535f3c319d705368d4a2894fc92b7cf77f8c80efed4cc408c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variantb2ce214c2a3e255535f3c319d705368d4a2894fc92b7cf77f8c80efed4cc408c.lean#L381).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3bdae49dc0f678ac3fbfdabcb50e2eacd6530831` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
