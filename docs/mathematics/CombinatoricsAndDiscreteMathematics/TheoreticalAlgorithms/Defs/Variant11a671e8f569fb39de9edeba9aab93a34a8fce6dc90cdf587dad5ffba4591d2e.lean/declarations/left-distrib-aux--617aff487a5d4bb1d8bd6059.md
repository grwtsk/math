## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:59e43507-a1df-87a6-9fcb-4001fcf2dbc7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 65–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem left_distrib_aux (n : ℕ) : ∀ a b c : Fin n, a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c :=
  fun ⟨a, _⟩ ⟨b, _⟩ ⟨c, _⟩ =>
  Fin.eq_of_val_eq <|
    calc
      a * ((b + c) % n) ≡ a * (b + c) [MOD n] := (Nat.mod_modEq _ _).mul_left _
      _ ≡ a * b + a * c [MOD n] := by rw [mul_add]
      _ ≡ a * b % n + a * c % n [MOD n] := (Nat.mod_modEq _ _).symm.add (Nat.mod_modEq _ _).symm

/-- Commutative ring structure on `Fin n`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant11a671e8f569fb39de9edeba9aab93a34a8fce6dc90cdf587dad5ffba4591d2e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant11a671e8f569fb39de9edeba9aab93a34a8fce6dc90cdf587dad5ffba4591d2e.lean#L65).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2b9f95d8b66860209ee85e2f9cca44a5b1e3b413` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
