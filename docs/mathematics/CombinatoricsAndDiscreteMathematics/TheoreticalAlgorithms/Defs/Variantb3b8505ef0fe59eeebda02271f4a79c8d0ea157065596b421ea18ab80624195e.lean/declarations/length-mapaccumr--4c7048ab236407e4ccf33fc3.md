## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4bbd20cb-d96c-cf01-0997-7daeb7d99e64`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 481–496.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem length_mapAccumr₂ :
    ∀ (f : α → β → γ → γ × δ) (x y c), length (mapAccumr₂ f x y c).2 = min (length x) (length y)
  | f, _ :: x, _ :: y, c =>
    calc
      succ (length (mapAccumr₂ f x y c).2) = succ (min (length x) (length y)) :=
        congr_arg succ (length_mapAccumr₂ f x y c)
      _ = min (succ (length x)) (succ (length y)) := Eq.symm (succ_min_succ (length x) (length y))
  | _, _ :: _, [], _ => rfl
  | _, [], _ :: _, _ => rfl
  | _, [], [], _ => rfl

end MapAccumr

section consecutivePairs

/-- `consecutivePairs [a, b, c, d]` is `[(a, b), (b, c), (c, d)]`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variantb3b8505ef0fe59eeebda02271f4a79c8d0ea157065596b421ea18ab80624195e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variantb3b8505ef0fe59eeebda02271f4a79c8d0ea157065596b421ea18ab80624195e.lean#L481).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f5ed44c25b7c60af51bcd48f72593408872b353` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
