## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f4a70e149f281895a567e404afe60a6be57fde154243b1532deb21716888321f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 366–382.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

def map₂Left (f : α → Option β → γ) : List α → List β → List γ
  | [], _ => []
  | a :: as, [] => (a :: as).map fun a => f a none
  | a :: as, b :: bs => f a (some b) :: map₂Left f as bs

/-- Right-biased version of `List.map₂`. `map₂Right f as bs` applies `f` to each
pair `aᵢ ∈ as` and `bᵢ ∈ bs`. If `as` is shorter than `bs`, `f` is applied to
`none` for the remaining `bᵢ`.

```
map₂Right Prod.mk [1, 2] ['a'] = [(some 1, 'a')]

map₂Right Prod.mk [1] ['a', 'b'] = [(some 1, 'a'), (none, 'b')]

map₂Right f as bs = (map₂Right' f as bs).fst
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variantb3b8505ef0fe59eeebda02271f4a79c8d0ea157065596b421ea18ab80624195e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variantb3b8505ef0fe59eeebda02271f4a79c8d0ea157065596b421ea18ab80624195e.lean#L366).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f5ed44c25b7c60af51bcd48f72593408872b353` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
