## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1ff99b11-2374-c9c8-c33e-c2658c0847cf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 809–827.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem support_mapRange_of_injective {e : M → N} (he0 : e 0 = 0) (f : ι →₀ M)
    (he : Function.Injective e) : (Finsupp.mapRange e he0 f).support = f.support := by
  ext
  simp only [Finsupp.mem_support_iff, Ne.def, Finsupp.mapRange_apply]
  exact he.ne_iff' he0
#align finsupp.support_map_range_of_injective Finsupp.support_mapRange_of_injective

end MapRange

/-! ### Declarations about `embDomain` -/


section EmbDomain

variable [Zero M] [Zero N]

/-- Given `f : α ↪ β` and `v : α →₀ M`, `Finsupp.embDomain f v : β →₀ M`
is the finitely supported function whose value at `f a : β` is `v a`.
For a `b : β` outside the range of `f`, it is zero. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variantd4bf68636f3ee2b7d57cb6b8a1caa25a5c72759af3f4272a998710edb5cca0c0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variantd4bf68636f3ee2b7d57cb6b8a1caa25a5c72759af3f4272a998710edb5cca0c0.lean#L809).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9e55713c42ef5f82359e05ea4133d9da19546c4f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
