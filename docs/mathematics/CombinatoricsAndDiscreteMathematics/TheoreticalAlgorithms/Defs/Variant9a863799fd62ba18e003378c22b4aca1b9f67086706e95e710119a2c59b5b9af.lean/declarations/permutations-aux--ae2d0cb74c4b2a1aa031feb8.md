## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d6bdb1f1b5e45a82e64cf1915fe8e0a6ed1c702b62ba3d3a43c55a08523546ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 201–212.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def permutations'Aux (t : α) : List α → List (List α)
  | [] => [[t]]
  | y :: ys => (t :: y :: ys) :: (permutations'Aux t ys).map (cons y)

/-- List of all permutations of `l`. This version of `permutations` is less efficient but has
simpler definitional equations. The permutations are in a different order,
but are equal up to permutation, as shown by `List.permutations_perm_permutations'`.

     permutations [1, 2, 3] =
       [[1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1],
        [1, 3, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]] -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant9a863799fd62ba18e003378c22b4aca1b9f67086706e95e710119a2c59b5b9af.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant9a863799fd62ba18e003378c22b4aca1b9f67086706e95e710119a2c59b5b9af.lean#L201).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e67b8bd01d72035f9dcf5d75a99e384292e4bb81` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
