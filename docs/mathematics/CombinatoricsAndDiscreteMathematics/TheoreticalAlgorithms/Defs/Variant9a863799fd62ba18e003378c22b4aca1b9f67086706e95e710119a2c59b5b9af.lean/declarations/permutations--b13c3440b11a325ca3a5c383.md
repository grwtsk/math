## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8c9daedca4c3ec3c4837876d4a4c873c8712213cb285086bb198834d58a11aaf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 186–200.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def permutations (l : List α) : List (List α) :=
  l :: permutationsAux l []

/-- `permutations'Aux t ts` inserts `t` into every position in `ts`, including the last.
This function is intended for use in specifications, so it is simpler than `permutationsAux2`,
which plays roughly the same role in `permutations`.

Note that `(permutationsAux2 t [] [] ts id).2` is similar to this function, but skips the last
position:

    permutations'Aux 10 [1, 2, 3] =
      [[10, 1, 2, 3], [1, 10, 2, 3], [1, 2, 10, 3], [1, 2, 3, 10]]
    (permutationsAux2 10 [] [] [1, 2, 3] id).2 =
      [[10, 1, 2, 3], [1, 10, 2, 3], [1, 2, 10, 3]] -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant9a863799fd62ba18e003378c22b4aca1b9f67086706e95e710119a2c59b5b9af.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant9a863799fd62ba18e003378c22b4aca1b9f67086706e95e710119a2c59b5b9af.lean#L186).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e67b8bd01d72035f9dcf5d75a99e384292e4bb81` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
