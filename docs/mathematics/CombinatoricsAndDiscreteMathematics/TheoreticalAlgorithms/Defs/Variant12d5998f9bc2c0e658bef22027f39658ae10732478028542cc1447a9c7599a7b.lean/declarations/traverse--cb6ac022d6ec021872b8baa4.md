## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7d872f2d646791541f6db2f873dd8d81dfd94a82664d4900aebc7af748c92ea2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 452–472.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
protected def traverse {F : Type u → Type v} [Applicative F] {α β : Type _} (f : α → F β)
    : List α → F (List β)
  | [] => pure []
  | x :: xs => List.cons <$> f x <*> List.traverse f xs
#align list.traverse List.traverse

#align list.get_rest List.getRest
#align list.slice List.dropSlice

/-- Left-biased version of `List.map₂`. `map₂Left' f as bs` applies `f` to each
pair of elements `aᵢ ∈ as` and `bᵢ ∈ bs`. If `bs` is shorter than `as`, `f` is
applied to `none` for the remaining `aᵢ`. Returns the results of the `f`
applications and the remaining `bs`.

```
map₂Left' prod.mk [1, 2] ['a'] = ([(1, some 'a'), (2, none)], [])

map₂Left' prod.mk [1] ['a', 'b'] = ([(1, some 'a')], ['b'])
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant12d5998f9bc2c0e658bef22027f39658ae10732478028542cc1447a9c7599a7b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant12d5998f9bc2c0e658bef22027f39658ae10732478028542cc1447a9c7599a7b.lean#L452).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1f0c6e213a78c8f4cffbb3e23a49f13d9d6aae0d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
