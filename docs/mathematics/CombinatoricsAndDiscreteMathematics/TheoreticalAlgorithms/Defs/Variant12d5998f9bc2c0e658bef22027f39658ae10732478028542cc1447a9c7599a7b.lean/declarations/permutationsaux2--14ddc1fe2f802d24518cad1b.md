## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e8134a559094d7a52a94864e2be6ac8b488797226c79c369f927c3bdfe3cb5d7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 246–256.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def permutationsAux2 (t : α) (ts : List α) (r : List β) : List α → (List α → β) → List α × List β
  | [], _ => (ts, r)
  | y :: ys, f =>
    let (us, zs) := permutationsAux2 t ts r ys (fun x: List α => f (y :: x))
    (y :: us, f (t :: y :: us) :: zs)
#align list.permutations_aux2 List.permutationsAux2

/-- A recursor for pairs of lists. To have `C l₁ l₂` for all `l₁`, `l₂`, it suffices to have it for
`l₂ = []` and to be able to pour the elements of `l₁` into `l₂`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant12d5998f9bc2c0e658bef22027f39658ae10732478028542cc1447a9c7599a7b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant12d5998f9bc2c0e658bef22027f39658ae10732478028542cc1447a9c7599a7b.lean#L246).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1f0c6e213a78c8f4cffbb3e23a49f13d9d6aae0d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
