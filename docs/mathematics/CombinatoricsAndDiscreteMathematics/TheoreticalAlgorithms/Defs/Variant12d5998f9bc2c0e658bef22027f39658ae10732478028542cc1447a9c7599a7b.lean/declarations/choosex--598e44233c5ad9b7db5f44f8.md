## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:76cb349b3c9d2e25fc21674440ebcfeb6beafd2b04683cb90abf6cb33f776dae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 408–421.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def chooseX : ∀ l : List α, ∀ _ : ∃ a, a ∈ l ∧ p a, { a // a ∈ l ∧ p a }
  | [], hp => False.elim (Exists.elim hp fun a h => not_mem_nil a h.left)
  | l :: ls, hp =>
    if pl : p l then ⟨l, ⟨mem_cons.mpr <| Or.inl rfl, pl⟩⟩
    else
      let ⟨a, ⟨a_mem_ls, pa⟩⟩ :=
        chooseX ls
          (hp.imp fun _ ⟨o, h₂⟩ => ⟨(mem_cons.mp o).resolve_left fun e => pl <| e ▸ h₂, h₂⟩)
      ⟨a, ⟨mem_cons.mpr <| Or.inr a_mem_ls, pa⟩⟩
#align list.choose_x List.chooseX

/-- Given a decidable predicate `p` and a proof of existence of `a ∈ l` such that `p a`,
choose the first element with this property. This version returns `a : α`, and properties
are given by `choose_mem` and `choose_property`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant12d5998f9bc2c0e658bef22027f39658ae10732478028542cc1447a9c7599a7b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant12d5998f9bc2c0e658bef22027f39658ae10732478028542cc1447a9c7599a7b.lean#L408).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1f0c6e213a78c8f4cffbb3e23a49f13d9d6aae0d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
