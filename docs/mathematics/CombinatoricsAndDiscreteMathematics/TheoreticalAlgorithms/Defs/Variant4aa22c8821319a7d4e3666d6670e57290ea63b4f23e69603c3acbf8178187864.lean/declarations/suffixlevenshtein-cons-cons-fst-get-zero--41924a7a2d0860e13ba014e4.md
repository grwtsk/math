## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c509e47e-897c-0ff1-3b53-939bec554825`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 256–273.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem suffixLevenshtein_cons_cons_fst_get_zero
    (x : α) (xs y ys) (w : 0 < (suffixLevenshtein C (x :: xs) (y :: ys)).val.length) :
    (suffixLevenshtein C (x :: xs) (y :: ys)).1[0]'w =
      let ⟨dx, _⟩ := suffixLevenshtein C xs (y :: ys)
      let ⟨dy, _⟩ := suffixLevenshtein C (x :: xs) ys
      let ⟨dxy, _⟩ := suffixLevenshtein C xs ys
      min
        (C.delete x + dx[0])
        (min
          (C.insert y + dy[0])
          (C.substitute x y + dxy[0])) := by
  conv =>
    lhs
    dsimp only [suffixLevenshtein_cons₂]
  simp only [suffixLevenshtein_cons₁]
  rw [impl_cons_fst_zero]
  rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant4aa22c8821319a7d4e3666d6670e57290ea63b4f23e69603c3acbf8178187864.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant4aa22c8821319a7d4e3666d6670e57290ea63b4f23e69603c3acbf8178187864.lean#L256).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e6c8a5a7ba40cddbd0f5a99a9280da010075a8dd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
