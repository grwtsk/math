## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `macro` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3b0a530c60233953e2d0116731375a3e907a37ff1980a682bbe0f1d2f1e81d82`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 153–170.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
macro (priority := low) "{" t:term " | " bs:extBinders "}" : term =>
  `({x | ∃ᵉ $bs:extBinders, $t = x})

/--
* `{ pat : X | p }` is notation for pattern matching in set-builder notation,
  where `pat` is a pattern that is matched by all objects of type `X`
  and `p` is a proposition that can refer to variables in the pattern.
  It is the set of all objects of type `X` which, when matched with the pattern `pat`,
  make `p` come out true.
* `{ pat | p }` is the same, but in the case when the type `X` can be inferred.

For example, `{ (m, n) : ℕ × ℕ | m * n = 12 }` denotes the set of all ordered pairs of
natural numbers whose product is 12.

Note that if the type ascription is left out and `p` can be interpreted as an extended binder,
then the extended binder interpretation will be used.  For example, `{ n + 1 | n < 3 }` will
be interpreted as `{ x : Nat | ∃ n < 3, n + 1 = x }` rather than using pattern matching.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant3a35aa26e7bceff5650a12168f8efd5b07e203906ca554118b75eedf53da9584.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Defs/Variant3a35aa26e7bceff5650a12168f8efd5b07e203906ca554118b75eedf53da9584.lean#L153).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fd285c52b9ce755ee776502bbc2efe0faf3c1d0a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
