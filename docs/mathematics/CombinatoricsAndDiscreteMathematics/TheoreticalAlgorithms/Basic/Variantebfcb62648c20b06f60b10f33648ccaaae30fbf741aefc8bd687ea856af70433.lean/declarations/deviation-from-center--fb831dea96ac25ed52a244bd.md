## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:47967979-c271-5a2b-da1f-7c17a0448a45`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 412–430.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem deviation_from_center {af : AffineForm} {eps : NoiseAssignment} {v : ℝ}
    (hvalid : validNoise eps) (hlen : eps.length = af.coeffs.length)
    (hmem : mem_affine af eps v) :
    |v - af.c0| ≤ af.deviationBound := by
  obtain ⟨err, herr, hv⟩ := hmem
  rw [hv]
  simp only [evalLinear]
  -- |c0 + linear + err - c0| = |linear + err|
  have heq : (af.c0 : ℝ) + linearSum af.coeffs eps + err - af.c0 = linearSum af.coeffs eps + err := by ring
  rw [heq]
  -- |linear + err| ≤ |linear| + |err| ≤ sumAbs + r = deviationBound
  have hlin := linearSum_bounded_by_sumAbs af.coeffs eps hvalid hlen
  simp only [deviationBound]
  calc |linearSum af.coeffs eps + err|
      ≤ |linearSum af.coeffs eps| + |err| := abs_add_le _ _
    _ ≤ (sumAbs af.coeffs : ℝ) + (af.r : ℝ) := by linarith
    _ = ((af.r + sumAbs af.coeffs : ℚ) : ℝ) := by push_cast; ring

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantebfcb62648c20b06f60b10f33648ccaaae30fbf741aefc8bd687ea856af70433.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantebfcb62648c20b06f60b10f33648ccaaae30fbf741aefc8bd687ea856af70433.lean#L412).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f531fe8254e896c15b1b8212a73a5f7bf0bdcc8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
