## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:955c363d-cdaa-6b2a-1a75-1857ce7a4075`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 371–384.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[csimp] theorem sublists_eq_sublistsFast : @sublists = @sublistsFast :=
    funext <| fun _ => funext fun _ => foldr_hom Array.toList fun _ r =>
  flatMap_eq_foldl.trans <| (foldl_toArray _ _ _).symm.trans <|
  r.foldl_hom Array.toList <| fun r _ => r.toList_append.symm

section Forall₂

variable {r : α → β → Prop} {p : γ → δ → Prop}

/--
`Forall₂ R l₁ l₂` means that `l₁` and `l₂` have the same length,
and whenever `a` is the nth element of `l₁`, and `b` is the nth element of `l₂`,
then `R a b` is satisfied.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant402a890c7d37778f1bb1316d2710101432dd31f59f131a4afc8f6e54d0136fae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant402a890c7d37778f1bb1316d2710101432dd31f59f131a4afc8f6e54d0136fae.lean#L371).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6174700fad7eb58aac268a3c8e4f04a297ab6c56` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
