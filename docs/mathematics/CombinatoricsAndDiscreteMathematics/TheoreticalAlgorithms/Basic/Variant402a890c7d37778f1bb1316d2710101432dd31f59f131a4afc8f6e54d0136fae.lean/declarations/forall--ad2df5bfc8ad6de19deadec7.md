## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:171c59a9ca5196329c382462a953275254fc2f58bb2716ebb1ce94132a589af1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 385–393.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive Forall₂ (R : α → β → Prop) : List α → List β → Prop
  /-- Two nil lists are `Forall₂`-related -/
  | nil : Forall₂ R [] []
  /-- Two cons lists are related by `Forall₂ R`
  if the heads are related by `R` and the tails are related by `Forall₂ R` -/
  | cons {a b l₁ l₂} : R a b → Forall₂ R l₁ l₂ → Forall₂ R (a :: l₁) (b :: l₂)

attribute [simp] Forall₂.nil

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant402a890c7d37778f1bb1316d2710101432dd31f59f131a4afc8f6e54d0136fae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant402a890c7d37778f1bb1316d2710101432dd31f59f131a4afc8f6e54d0136fae.lean#L385).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6174700fad7eb58aac268a3c8e4f04a297ab6c56` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
