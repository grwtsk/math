## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a5186c71-108c-4918-368a-96d289cd22da`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1090–1099.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[csimp] theorem swapAt_eq_swapAtTR : @swapAt = @swapAtTR := by
  funext α xs i v
  let rec go : ∀ xs i (acc : Array α), swapAtTR.go (acc.toList ++ xs) v xs i acc =
        (xs[i]?.getD v, acc.toList ++ xs.set i v)
  | [], _, _ | _::_, 0, _ => by simp [swapAtTR.go]
  | a::xs, i+1, acc => by simpa [swapAtTR.go] using go xs i (acc.push a)
  exact (go xs i #[]).symm

/-- `l.swap i j` exchanges the elements at positions `i` and `j` of `l`.
If either index is out of bounds, `l` is returned unchanged. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant402a890c7d37778f1bb1316d2710101432dd31f59f131a4afc8f6e54d0136fae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant402a890c7d37778f1bb1316d2710101432dd31f59f131a4afc8f6e54d0136fae.lean#L1090).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6174700fad7eb58aac268a3c8e4f04a297ab6c56` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
