## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:df42fb1a-fcb8-1b74-dcb5-7b3b6b3d8d23`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1184–1195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[csimp] theorem range'_eq_range'TR : @range' = @range'TR := by
  funext s n step
  let rec go (s) : ∀ n m,
    range'TR.go step n (s + step * n) (range' (s + step * n) m step) = range' s (n + m) step
  | 0, m => by simp [range'TR.go]
  | n+1, m => by
    simp [range'TR.go]
    rw [Nat.mul_succ, ← Nat.add_assoc, Nat.add_sub_cancel, Nat.add_right_comm n]
    exact go s n (m + 1)
  exact (go s n 0).symm

/-- Drop `none`s from a list, and replace each remaining `some a` with `a`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantcbaa5bfbd86e592a7ca1f8628e6a6eba49d7f01646526d78c320cc71d835040b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantcbaa5bfbd86e592a7ca1f8628e6a6eba49d7f01646526d78c320cc71d835040b.lean#L1184).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `17bb198c53047304d48fcfc05b1a538c7027298d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
