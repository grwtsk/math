## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e395b716-2681-9386-80d0-5e516c355f1c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 25–34.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[csimp] theorem set_eq_setTR : @set = @setTR := by
  funext α l n a; simp [setTR]
  let rec go (acc) : ∀ xs n, l = acc.data ++ xs →
    setTR.go l a xs n acc = acc.data ++ xs.set n a
  | [], _ => fun h => by simp [setTR.go, set, h]
  | x::xs, 0 => by simp [setTR.go, set]
  | x::xs, n+1 => fun h => by simp [setTR.go, set]; rw [go _ xs]; {simp}; simp [h]
  exact (go #[] _ _ rfl).symm

/-- Tail recursive version of `erase`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantcbaa5bfbd86e592a7ca1f8628e6a6eba49d7f01646526d78c320cc71d835040b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantcbaa5bfbd86e592a7ca1f8628e6a6eba49d7f01646526d78c320cc71d835040b.lean#L25).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `17bb198c53047304d48fcfc05b1a538c7027298d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
