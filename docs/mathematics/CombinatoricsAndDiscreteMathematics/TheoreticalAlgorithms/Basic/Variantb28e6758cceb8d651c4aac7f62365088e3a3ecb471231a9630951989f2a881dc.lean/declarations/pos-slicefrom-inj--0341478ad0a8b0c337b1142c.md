## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:149b787f-da29-3d24-7179-c3bb9f9839a8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2324–2329.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Pos.sliceFrom_inj {s : String} {p₀ : s.Pos} {pos pos' : s.Pos} {h h'} :
    p₀.sliceFrom pos h = p₀.sliceFrom pos' h' ↔ pos = pos' := by
  simp [Pos.ext_iff, Pos.Raw.ext_iff, Slice.Pos.ext_iff, Pos.le_iff, Pos.Raw.le_iff] at ⊢ h h'
  omega

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantb28e6758cceb8d651c4aac7f62365088e3a3ecb471231a9630951989f2a881dc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantb28e6758cceb8d651c4aac7f62365088e3a3ecb471231a9630951989f2a881dc.lean#L2324).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `28761e3d388d0e5800a6d7114de4549892584ef5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
