## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e6acb640c621d8f533694d19b0af1ac84ead55840b54689a2bcc469838f24815`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 886–911.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance decidableBAll (p : α → Prop) [DecidablePred p] :
    ∀ l : List α, Decidable (∀ x, x ∈ l → p x)
  | [] => isTrue nofun
  | x :: xs =>
    if h₁ : p x then
      match decidableBAll p xs with
      | isTrue h₂ => isTrue fun
        | y, .tail _ h => h₂ y h
        | _, .head .. => h₁
      | isFalse h₂ => isFalse fun H => h₂ fun y hm => H y (.tail _ hm)
    else isFalse fun H => h₁ <| H x (.head ..)

/-! ## Sublists -/

/-! ### take -/

/--
Extracts the first `n` elements of `xs`, or the whole list if `n` is greater than `xs.length`.

`O(min n |xs|)`.

Examples:
* `[a, b, c, d, e].take 0 = []`
* `[a, b, c, d, e].take 3 = [a, b, c]`
* `[a, b, c, d, e].take 6 = [a, b, c, d, e]`

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant6fe2c8b4db30895cfc240e96d49119a8fb9997c6074e294ba62352a7f9adba72.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant6fe2c8b4db30895cfc240e96d49119a8fb9997c6074e294ba62352a7f9adba72.lean#L886).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a45b3110afdf9a53be21f7051742b2f364d8dd49` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
