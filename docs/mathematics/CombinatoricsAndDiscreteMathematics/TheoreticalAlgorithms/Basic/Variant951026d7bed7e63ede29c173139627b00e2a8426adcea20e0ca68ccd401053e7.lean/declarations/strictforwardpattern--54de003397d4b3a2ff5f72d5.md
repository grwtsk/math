## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:243684119cb36c0d0f5b0df635f8183330f25dfdd7fa16f58896aa078c0af035`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 195–214.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class StrictForwardPattern {ρ : Type} (pat : ρ) [ForwardPattern pat] : Prop where
  ne_startPos {s : Slice} (h) (q) :
    ForwardPattern.skipPrefixOfNonempty? pat s h = some q → q ≠ s.startPos

/--
Provides a conversion from a pattern to an iterator of {name}`SearchStep` that searches for matches
of the pattern from the start towards the end of a {name}`Slice`.

While these operations can be implemented on top of {name}`ForwardPattern`, some patterns allow
for more efficient implementations. For example, a searcher for {name}`String` patterns derived
from the {name}`ForwardPattern` instance on strings would try to match the pattern at every
position in the string, but more efficient string matching routines are known. Indeed, the Lean
standard library uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm. See the module
{module -checked}`Init.Data.String.Pattern.String` for the implementation.

This class can be used to provide such an efficient implementation. If there is no
need to specialize in this fashion, then
{name (scope := "Init.Data.String.Pattern.Basic")}`ToForwardSearcher.defaultImplementation` can be
used to automatically derive an instance.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant951026d7bed7e63ede29c173139627b00e2a8426adcea20e0ca68ccd401053e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant951026d7bed7e63ede29c173139627b00e2a8426adcea20e0ca68ccd401053e7.lean#L195).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `875959034908211184fa011d3f48f8d7c73a940e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
