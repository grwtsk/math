## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c299868829efe2c238fa939ff3461f741e9d8a458f8e33e2f2d3c9407ee784e8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 858–888.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
def findSomeM? {α : Type u} {β : Type v} {m : Type v → Type w} [Monad m] (f : α → m (Option β)) (as : Array α) : m (Option β) := do
  for a in as do
    match (← f a) with
    | some b => return some b
    | _      => pure ⟨⟩
  return none

/--
Returns the first element of the array for which the monadic predicate `p` returns `true`, or `none`
if no such element is found. Elements of the array are checked in order.

The monad `m` is restricted to `Type → Type` to avoid needing to use `ULift Bool` in `p`'s type.

Example:
```lean example
#eval #[7, 6, 5, 8, 1, 2, 6].findM? fun i => do
  if i < 5 then
    return true
  if i ≤ 6 then
    IO.println s!"Almost! {i}"
  return false
```
```output
Almost! 6
Almost! 5
```
```output
some 1
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant85b1fcc2eac430164656c02295d9cf5d3549826517a2a89083a7afae28b1e4f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant85b1fcc2eac430164656c02295d9cf5d3549826517a2a89083a7afae28b1e4f2.lean#L858).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7d58dee5983aa201468b99df02a6d8c18c7a1794` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
