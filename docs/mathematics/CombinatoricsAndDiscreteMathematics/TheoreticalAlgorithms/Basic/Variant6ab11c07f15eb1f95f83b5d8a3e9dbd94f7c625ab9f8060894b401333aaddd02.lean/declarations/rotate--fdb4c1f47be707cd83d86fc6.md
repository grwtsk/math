## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cba5f615e1508767af4cee2fde0fbb9584ef710118ebab042210ecaa69f00b91`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1233–1246.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
@[simp] def rotate' : List α → Nat → List α
  | [], _ => []
  | l, 0 => l
  | a :: l, n+1 => rotate' (l ++ [a]) n

/--
`mapDiagM f l` calls `f` on all elements in the upper triangular part of `l × l`.
That is, for each `e ∈ l`, it will run `f e e` and then `f e e'`
for each `e'` that appears after `e` in `l`.
```
mapDiagM f [1, 2, 3] =
  return [← f 1 1, ← f 1 2, ← f 1 3, ← f 2 2, ← f 2 3, ← f 3 3]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant6ab11c07f15eb1f95f83b5d8a3e9dbd94f7c625ab9f8060894b401333aaddd02.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant6ab11c07f15eb1f95f83b5d8a3e9dbd94f7c625ab9f8060894b401333aaddd02.lean#L1233).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `259c26784826ee775872f1aeb666dee30565a411` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
