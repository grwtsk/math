## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ed156b272d022bad12dd7c4933218b04e47f7fd243ecf28819c43cb11512582e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1570–1597.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toChunks {α} : Nat → List α → List (List α)
  | _, [] => []
  | 0, xs => [xs]
  | n, x :: xs =>
    let rec
    /-- Auxliary definition used to define `toChunks`.
    `toChunks.go xs acc₁ acc₂` pushes elements into `acc₁` until it reaches size `n`,
    then it pushes the resulting list to `acc₂` and continues until `xs` is exhausted. -/
    go : List α → Array α → Array (List α) → List (List α)
    | [], acc₁, acc₂ => acc₂.push acc₁.toList |>.toList
    | x :: xs, acc₁, acc₂ =>
      if acc₁.size == n then
        go xs ((Array.mkEmpty n).push x) (acc₂.push acc₁.toList)
      else
        go xs (acc₁.push x) acc₂
    go xs #[x] #[]

/-!
We add some n-ary versions of `List.zipWith` for functions with more than two arguments.
These can also be written in terms of `List.zip` or `List.zipWith`.
For example, `zipWith₃ f xs ys zs` could also be written as
`zipWith id (zipWith f xs ys) zs`
or as
`(zip xs <| zip ys zs).map fun ⟨x, y, z⟩ => f x y z`.
-/

-- TODO(Mario): tail recursive
/-- Ternary version of `List.zipWith`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant6ab11c07f15eb1f95f83b5d8a3e9dbd94f7c625ab9f8060894b401333aaddd02.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant6ab11c07f15eb1f95f83b5d8a3e9dbd94f7c625ab9f8060894b401333aaddd02.lean#L1570).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `259c26784826ee775872f1aeb666dee30565a411` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
