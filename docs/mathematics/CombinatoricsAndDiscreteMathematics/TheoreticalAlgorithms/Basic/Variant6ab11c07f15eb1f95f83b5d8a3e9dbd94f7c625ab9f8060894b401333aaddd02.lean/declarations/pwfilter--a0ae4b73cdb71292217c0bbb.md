## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:43b6f5c3f41f8d3a7efccb3c7209a129d027f92a1b6ab615a46ccec405d5820f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1139–1149.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
def pwFilter (R : α → α → Prop) [DecidableRel R] (l : List α) : List α :=
  l.foldr (fun x IH => if ∀ y ∈ IH, R x y then x :: IH else IH) []

section Chain

variable (R : α → α → Prop)

/-- `Chain R a l` means that `R` holds between adjacent elements of `a::l`.
```
Chain R a [b, c, d] ↔ R a b ∧ R b c ∧ R c d
``` -/
````

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant6ab11c07f15eb1f95f83b5d8a3e9dbd94f7c625ab9f8060894b401333aaddd02.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant6ab11c07f15eb1f95f83b5d8a3e9dbd94f7c625ab9f8060894b401333aaddd02.lean#L1139).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `259c26784826ee775872f1aeb666dee30565a411` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
