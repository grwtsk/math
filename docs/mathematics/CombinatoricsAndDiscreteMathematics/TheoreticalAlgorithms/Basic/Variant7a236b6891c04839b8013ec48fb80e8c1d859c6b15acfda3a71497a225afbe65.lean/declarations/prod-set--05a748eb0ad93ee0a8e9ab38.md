## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3ff5f3e8-8ead-8edc-028b-2566d02b2ad1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 217–235.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    ∀ (L : List M) (n : ℕ) (a : M),
      (L.set n a).prod =
        ((L.take n).prod * if n < L.length then a else 1) * (L.drop (n + 1)).prod
  | x :: xs, 0, a => by simp [set]
  | x :: xs, i + 1, a => by simp [set, prod_set xs i a, mul_assoc, Nat.succ_eq_add_one]

/-- We'd like to state this as `L.headI * L.tail.prod = L.prod`, but because `L.headI` relies on an
inhabited instance to return a garbage value on the empty list, this is not possible.
Instead, we write the statement in terms of `(L.get? 0).getD 1`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant7a236b6891c04839b8013ec48fb80e8c1d859c6b15acfda3a71497a225afbe65.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant7a236b6891c04839b8013ec48fb80e8c1d859c6b15acfda3a71497a225afbe65.lean#L217).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `426c888d08d9bd1213e46fdb0f9b863ad808e5db` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
