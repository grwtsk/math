## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:77a4a6d0-a50d-e172-a2bf-efa436cea3d3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 180–193.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean

    ∀ (L : List M) (i : ℕ) (p), (L.take (i + 1)).prod = (L.take i).prod * L.nthLe i p

  | h :: t, 0, _ => rfl
  | h :: t, n + 1, p => by
    dsimp
    rw [prod_cons, prod_cons, prod_take_succ t n (Nat.lt_of_succ_lt_succ p), mul_assoc,
      nthLe_cons, dif_neg (Nat.add_one_ne_zero _)]
    simp

#align list.sum_take_succ List.sum_take_succ

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant7a236b6891c04839b8013ec48fb80e8c1d859c6b15acfda3a71497a225afbe65.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant7a236b6891c04839b8013ec48fb80e8c1d859c6b15acfda3a71497a225afbe65.lean#L180).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `426c888d08d9bd1213e46fdb0f9b863ad808e5db` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
