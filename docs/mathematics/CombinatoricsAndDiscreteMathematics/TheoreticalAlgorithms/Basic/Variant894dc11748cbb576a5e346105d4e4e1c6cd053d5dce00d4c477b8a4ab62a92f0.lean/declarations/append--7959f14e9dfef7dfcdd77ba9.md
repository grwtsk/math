## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:32541cebd53fb791c0e2828f8fa9c73108843d4f4893cd0ae052ebadfb3299e6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 361–380.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def append : RBNode α → RBNode α → RBNode α
  | nil, x | x, nil => x
  | node red a x b, node red c y d =>
    match append b c with
    | node red b' z c' => node red (node red a x b') z (node red c' y d)
    | bc               => node red a x (node red bc y d)
  | node black a x b, node black c y d =>
    match append b c with
    | node red b' z c' => node red (node black a x b') z (node black c' y d)
    | bc               => balLeft a x (node black bc y d)
  | a@(node black ..), node red b x c => node red (append a b) x c
  | node red a x b, c@(node black ..) => node red a x (append b c)
termination_by x y => x.size + y.size

The core of the `erase` function. The tree returned from this function has a broken invariant,
which is restored in `erase`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant894dc11748cbb576a5e346105d4e4e1c6cd053d5dce00d4c477b8a4ab62a92f0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant894dc11748cbb576a5e346105d4e4e1c6cd053d5dce00d4c477b8a4ab62a92f0.lean#L361).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a7441e5b1f39ad03164b09e881961f02b1cea35f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
