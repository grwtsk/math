## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e0e0ed87-8766-4ca3-cebe-9193abb8a9e1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 646–657.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem destruct_ofSeq (s : Seq α) :
    destruct (ofSeq s) = Computation.pure (s.head.map fun a => (a, ofSeq s.tail)) :=
  destruct_eq_pure <| by
    simp only [destruct, Seq.destruct, Option.map_eq_map, ofSeq, Computation.corec_eq, rmap,
      Seq.head]
    rw [show Seq.get? (some <$> s) 0 = some <$> Seq.get? s 0 by apply Seq.map_get?]
    rcases Seq.get? s 0 with - | a
    · rfl
    dsimp only [(· <$> ·)]
    simp

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant21c4707e22bf2caa43fab98adeace839d894b567d995743c0bcca975aad25333.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant21c4707e22bf2caa43fab98adeace839d894b567d995743c0bcca975aad25333.lean#L646).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7b136e2ec978e1a0fdd188c1d10f308eca7d5540` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
