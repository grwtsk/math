## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e57f1e80-9484-37a4-ba9f-9166d9299fc4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 374–383.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem destruct_some_of_destruct_tail_some {s : WSeq α} {a} (h : some a ∈ destruct (tail s)) :
    ∃ a', some a' ∈ destruct s := by
  unfold tail Functor.map at h; simp only [destruct_flatten] at h
  rcases exists_of_mem_bind h with ⟨t, tm, td⟩; clear h
  rcases Computation.exists_of_mem_map tm with ⟨t', ht', ht2⟩; clear tm
  rcases t' with - | t' <;> rw [← ht2] at td <;> simp only [destruct_nil] at td
  · have := mem_unique td (ret_mem _)
    contradiction
  · exact ⟨_, ht'⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant21c4707e22bf2caa43fab98adeace839d894b567d995743c0bcca975aad25333.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant21c4707e22bf2caa43fab98adeace839d894b567d995743c0bcca975aad25333.lean#L374).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7b136e2ec978e1a0fdd188c1d10f308eca7d5540` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
