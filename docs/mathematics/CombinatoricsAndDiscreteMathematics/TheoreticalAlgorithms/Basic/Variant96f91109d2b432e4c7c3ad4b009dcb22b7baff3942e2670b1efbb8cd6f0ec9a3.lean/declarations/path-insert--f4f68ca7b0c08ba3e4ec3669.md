## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:89d42dd06617e7a1205a5a4f1b252cbfb94f88115ec40b9c7e8ad4201f758a2f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 489–499.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Path.insert (path : Path α) (t : RBNode α) (v : α) : RBNode α :=
  match t with
  | nil => path.insertNew v
  | node c a _ b => path.fill (node c a v b)

/--
`path.del t c` does the second part of `RBNode.del`, which unwinds the stack
and rebuilds the tree. The `c` argument is the color of the node before the deletion
(we used `t₀.isBlack` for this in `RBNode.del` but the original tree is no longer
available in this formulation).
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant96f91109d2b432e4c7c3ad4b009dcb22b7baff3942e2670b1efbb8cd6f0ec9a3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant96f91109d2b432e4c7c3ad4b009dcb22b7baff3942e2670b1efbb8cd6f0ec9a3.lean#L489).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2921df75acbbb01ebd61ad5c318ef687c0161d74` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
