## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dbb790bbb5cc2f34097ec377fc470361e67099ceaeb796732dd137ec3ba7cb1f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 781–792.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class ModifyWF (t : RBSet α cmp) (cut : α → Ordering) (f : α → α) : Prop where
  /-- The resulting tree is well formed. -/
  wf : (t.1.modify cut f).WF cmp

/--
`O(log n)`. In-place replace an element found by `cut`.
This takes the element out of the tree while `f` runs,
so it uses the element linearly if `t` is unshared.

The `ModifyWF` assumption is required because `f` may change
the ordering properties of the element, which would break the invariants.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant96f91109d2b432e4c7c3ad4b009dcb22b7baff3942e2670b1efbb8cd6f0ec9a3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant96f91109d2b432e4c7c3ad4b009dcb22b7baff3942e2670b1efbb8cd6f0ec9a3.lean#L781).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2921df75acbbb01ebd61ad5c318ef687c0161d74` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
