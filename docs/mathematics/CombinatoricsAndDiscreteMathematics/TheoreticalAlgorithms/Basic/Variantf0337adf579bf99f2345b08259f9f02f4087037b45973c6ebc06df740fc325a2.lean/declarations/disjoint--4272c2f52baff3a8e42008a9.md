## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:caff8b7bb6cefb3e3f72cc627949d7ae636c4328d9634cda507155444869c32c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 538–546.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
def Disjoint (l₁ l₂ : List α) : Prop :=
  ∀ ⦃a⦄, a ∈ l₁ → a ∈ l₂ → False

/--
Returns the longest initial prefix of two lists such that they are pairwise related by `R`.
```
takeWhile₂ (· < ·) [1, 2, 4, 5] [5, 4, 3, 6] = ([1, 2], [5, 4])
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantf0337adf579bf99f2345b08259f9f02f4087037b45973c6ebc06df740fc325a2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantf0337adf579bf99f2345b08259f9f02f4087037b45973c6ebc06df740fc325a2.lean#L538).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `893abf184548a93993213468d59ab1e39bbe0620` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
