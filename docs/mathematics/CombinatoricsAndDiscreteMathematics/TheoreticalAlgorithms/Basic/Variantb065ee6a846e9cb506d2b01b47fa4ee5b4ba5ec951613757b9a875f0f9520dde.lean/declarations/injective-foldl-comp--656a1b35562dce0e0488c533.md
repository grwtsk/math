## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bc064183-0849-d165-15e8-3fc919058c94`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2483–2507.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem injective_foldl_comp {α : Type*} {l : List (α → α)} {f : α → α}
    (hl : ∀ f ∈ l, Function.Injective f) (hf : Function.Injective f) :
    Function.Injective (@List.foldl (α → α) (α → α) Function.comp f l) := by
  induction' l with lh lt l_ih generalizing f
  · exact hf
  · apply l_ih fun _ h => hl _ (List.mem_cons_of_mem _ h)
    apply Function.Injective.comp hf
    apply hl _ (List.mem_cons_self _ _)
#align list.injective_foldl_comp List.injective_foldl_comp

/- Porting note: couldn't do induction proof because "code generator does not support recursor
  'List.rec' yet". Earlier proof:

  induction l with
  | nil => exact hb
  | cons hd tl IH =>
    refine' hl _ _ hd (mem_cons_self hd tl)
    refine' IH _
    intro y hy x hx
    exact hl y hy x (mem_cons_of_mem hd hx)
-/
/-- Induction principle for values produced by a `foldr`: if a property holds
for the seed element `b : β` and for all incremental `op : α → β → β`
performed on the elements `(a : α) ∈ l`. The principle is given for
a `Sort`-valued predicate, i.e., it can also be used to construct data. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantb065ee6a846e9cb506d2b01b47fa4ee5b4ba5ec951613757b9a875f0f9520dde.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantb065ee6a846e9cb506d2b01b47fa4ee5b4ba5ec951613757b9a875f0f9520dde.lean#L2483).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bb2da47a2f8597262ac23969079ed20f1fa2ed43` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
