## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5bb00ded46d39636390e3f8d05674d0389b63b0bbb0be3fc7e63e01122cf8a55`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 667–680.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
    def mk'
      («meta»  : Cmd.Meta)
      (run     : Parsed → IO UInt32)
      (subCmds : Array ExtendableCmd := #[])
      : ExtendableCmd :=
        .init «meta» run subCmds none

    /--
    Creates a new `ExtendableCmd`. The resulting `ExtendableCmd` will not have an extension.
    Adds a `-h, --help` and a `--version` flag if `«meta»` designates a version.
    - `«meta»`:  Non-recursive meta-data.
    - `run`:     Handler to run when the command is called and flags/arguments have been successfully processed.
    - `subCmds`: Subcommands.
    -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant8feca42a024562cd95361df4b330a65e46239d73ceaacc9c2ed23cb415a2f517.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant8feca42a024562cd95361df4b330a65e46239d73ceaacc9c2ed23cb415a2f517.lean#L667).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5cbf904d5d87c166d8bfcf8b166c9249abf5edab` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
