## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:288def430494b3e7110a9b0af6a011ace99d0a6e069970da4cc2e2efa3223bb4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1569–1582.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
    partial def applyExtensions (c : Cmd) : Cmd := Id.run do
      let subCmds := c.subCmds.map applyExtensions
      let c := c.update (subCmds := subCmds)
      let some extension := c.extension?
        | return c
      extension.extend (.ofFullCmd c) |>.toFullCmd c

    /--
    Processes `args` by applying all extensions in `c`, `Cmd.parse?`ing the input according to `c`
    and then applying the postprocessing extension of the respective (sub)command that was called.
    Note that `args` designates the list `<foo>` in `somebinary <foo>`.
    Returns either the (sub)command that an error occured in and the corresponding error message or
    the (sub)command that was called and the parsed input after postprocessing.
    -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variante325b55b12eca6a94bd44d591c10f019b7ba130c33d0c3c6680ba392c26654d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variante325b55b12eca6a94bd44d591c10f019b7ba130c33d0c3c6680ba392c26654d7.lean#L1569).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2b1e2541862ca82038a889c8cd41b3ea2e137489` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
