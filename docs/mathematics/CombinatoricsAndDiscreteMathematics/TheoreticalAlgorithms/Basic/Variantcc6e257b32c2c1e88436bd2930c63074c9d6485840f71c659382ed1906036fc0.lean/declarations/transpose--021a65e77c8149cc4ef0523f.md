## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:26150f11f9f4ba45ae07d0f5d5c28a4c3ba11f482fe4910a8ebf274dabe251f5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 437–463.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
def transpose (l : List (List α)) : List (List α) := (l.foldr go #[]).toList where
  /-- `pop : List α → StateM (List α) (List α)` transforms the input list `old`
  by taking the head of the current state and pushing it on the head of `old`.
  If the state list is empty, then `old` is left unchanged. -/
  pop (old : List α) : StateM (List α) (List α)
    | [] => (old, [])
    | a :: l => (a :: old, l)

  /-- `go : List α → Array (List α) → Array (List α)` handles the insertion of
  a new list into all the lists in the array:
  `go [a, b, c] #[l₁, l₂, l₃] = #[a::l₁, b::l₂, c::l₃]`.
  If the new list is too short, the later lists are unchanged, and if it is too long
  the array is extended:
  ```
  go [a] #[l₁, l₂, l₃] = #[a::l₁, l₂, l₃]
  go [a, b, c, d] #[l₁, l₂, l₃] = #[a::l₁, b::l₂, c::l₃, [d]]
  ```
  -/
  go (l : List α) (acc : Array (List α)) : Array (List α) :=
    let (acc, l) := acc.mapM pop l
    l.foldl (init := acc) fun arr a => arr.push [a]

/--
List of all sections through a list of lists. A section
of `[L₁, L₂, ..., Lₙ]` is a list whose first element comes from
`L₁`, whose second element comes from `L₂`, and so on.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantcc6e257b32c2c1e88436bd2930c63074c9d6485840f71c659382ed1906036fc0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantcc6e257b32c2c1e88436bd2930c63074c9d6485840f71c659382ed1906036fc0.lean#L437).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e11053fea25281b26f9d73e46addf433b9a1dc92` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
