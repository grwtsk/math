## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1742d63d-8445-38d8-3de1-8464dcf93a9a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 188–204.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem zipWithPad_add_neg_zero (l : List ℚ) :
    ∀ c ∈ zipWithPad (· + ·) l (l.map (·.neg)), c = 0 := by
  induction l with
  | nil =>
    intro c hc
    simp only [List.map_nil, zipWithPad, List.not_mem_nil] at hc
  | cons h t ih =>
    intro c hc
    simp only [List.map_cons, zipWithPad, List.mem_cons] at hc
    cases hc with
    | inl heq =>
      rw [heq]
      show h + (-h) = 0
      ring
    | inr hmem => exact ih c hmem

/-- Subtraction of the same form gives all-zero coefficients -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantc221311c4d85a01dc754923928ed3c7ae37ef489d9a598767984ca20c2f3cc5e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantc221311c4d85a01dc754923928ed3c7ae37ef489d9a598767984ca20c2f3cc5e.lean#L188).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a3c906d8899028f064ac01abf4b1db912db27469` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
