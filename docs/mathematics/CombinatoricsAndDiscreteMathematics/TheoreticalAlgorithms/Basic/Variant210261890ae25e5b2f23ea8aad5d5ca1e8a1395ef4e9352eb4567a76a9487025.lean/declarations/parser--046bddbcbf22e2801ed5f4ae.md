## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:42521717f943ccfab00edb7106b531392a00bf85502a8bea0ba7038e1aae990e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1086–1098.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def parser (format : FormatString) (config : FormatConfig) (aw : Awareness) : Parser DateTime :=
  let rec go (builder : DateBuilder) (x : FormatString) : Parser DateTime :=
    match x with
    | x :: xs => parseWithDate builder config x >>= (go · xs)
    | [] =>
      match builder.build aw with
      | some res => pure res
      | none => fail "could not parse the date"
  go {} format

/--
Parser for a format with a builder.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant210261890ae25e5b2f23ea8aad5d5ca1e8a1395ef4e9352eb4567a76a9487025.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant210261890ae25e5b2f23ea8aad5d5ca1e8a1395ef4e9352eb4567a76a9487025.lean#L1086).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `10bdf6dfd9346e8fa574fa37b229318da30b88de` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
