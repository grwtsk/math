## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:509c2060-8b16-23bf-f2e1-17812b312db5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 953–972.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem drop_eq_nil_of_le {as : List α} {i : Nat} (h : as.length ≤ i) : as.drop i = [] := by
  match as, i with
  | [],    i   => simp
  | _::_,  0   => simp at h
  | _::as, i+1 => simp only [length_cons] at h; exact @drop_eq_nil_of_le as i (Nat.le_of_succ_le_succ h)

/-! ### extract -/

/--
Returns the slice of `l` from indices `start` (inclusive) to `stop` (exclusive).

Examples:
* [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].extract 1 2 = [1]
* [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].extract 2 2 = []
* [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].extract 2 4 = [2, 3]
* [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].extract 2 = [2, 3, 4, 5]
* [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].extract (stop := 2) = [0, 1]
-/
-- This is only an abbreviation for the operation in terms of `drop` and `take`.
-- We do not prove properties of extract itself.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantd3b7b17ebd20cc09d7db5e34dcd303490838683e5a66bfb56b57818f5f04150c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantd3b7b17ebd20cc09d7db5e34dcd303490838683e5a66bfb56b57818f5f04150c.lean#L953).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aa5e35378b6eab59b08beb521645cfe03fd1cd30` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
