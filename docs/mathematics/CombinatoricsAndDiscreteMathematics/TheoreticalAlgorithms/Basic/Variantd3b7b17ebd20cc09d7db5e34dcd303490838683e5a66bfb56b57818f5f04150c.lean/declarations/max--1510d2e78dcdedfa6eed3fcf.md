## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dbddb78f85a6ea015b1ee08855f5d4e61328b6d99c37e6fa94f32a1b70456067`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2198–2210.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def max? [Max α] : List α → Option α
  | []    => none
  | a::as => some <| as.foldl max a

/-! ### max -/

/--
Returns the largest element of a non-empty list.

Examples:
* `[4].max (by decide) = 4`
* `[1, 4, 2, 10, 6].max (by decide) = 10`
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantd3b7b17ebd20cc09d7db5e34dcd303490838683e5a66bfb56b57818f5f04150c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantd3b7b17ebd20cc09d7db5e34dcd303490838683e5a66bfb56b57818f5f04150c.lean#L2198).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aa5e35378b6eab59b08beb521645cfe03fd1cd30` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
