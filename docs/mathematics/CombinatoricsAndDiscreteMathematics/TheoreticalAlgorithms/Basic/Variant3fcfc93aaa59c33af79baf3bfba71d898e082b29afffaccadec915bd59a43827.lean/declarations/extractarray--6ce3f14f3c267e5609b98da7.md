## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6529f537ca1cb27237d2982ac5a1a272dd9fa4ba15644a2c06309e498fe84dac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 190–208.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def extractArray (a : Array α) (b : Bitset) : Array α := Id.run do
  let mut new := #[]
  for i in b.lowToHigh do
    if h : i < a.size then
      new := new.push a[i]
    else break
  return new

/-! ## Representations -/

deriving instance ToJson, FromJson for Bitset

/-- Converts a `Bitset` to a string of the form `"◻◼◻◻◻◼◻◼◼◻◻◼"`, where indices run left-to-right
from `0` and `◻` represents absence at that index, while `◼` represents presence.

By default, this shows only as many squares as necessary (or `"◻"` for an empty bitset), and so in
the nonempty case the last square will always be `◼`. Instead, `univSize? : Option Nat` can be
provided to set the total number of indices, and will either truncate (even if higher bits are set)
or pad with `◻` as appropriate. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant3fcfc93aaa59c33af79baf3bfba71d898e082b29afffaccadec915bd59a43827.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variant3fcfc93aaa59c33af79baf3bfba71d898e082b29afffaccadec915bd59a43827.lean#L190).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e319843ad1210998e75e03afc81cdd2231b2efd1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
