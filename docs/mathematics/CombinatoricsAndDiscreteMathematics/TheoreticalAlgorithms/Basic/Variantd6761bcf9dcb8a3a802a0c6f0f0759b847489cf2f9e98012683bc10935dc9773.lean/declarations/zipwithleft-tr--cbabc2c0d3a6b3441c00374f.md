## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9c3f2daf3e6b3709053e7e90fd1db6b034324aec4547ff82bf0285ebdaf93972`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 750–757.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[inline] def zipWithLeft'TR (f : α → Option β → γ)
    (as : List α) (bs : List β) : List γ × List β := go as bs #[] where
  /-- Auxiliary for `zipWithLeft'TR`: `zipWithLeft'TR.go l acc = acc.toList ++ zipWithLeft' l`. -/
  go : List α → List β → Array γ → List γ × List β
  | [], bs, acc => (acc.toList, bs)
  | as, [], acc => (as.foldl (fun acc a => acc.push (f a none)) acc |>.toList, [])
  | a :: as, b :: bs, acc => go as bs (acc.push (f a (some b)))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantd6761bcf9dcb8a3a802a0c6f0f0759b847489cf2f9e98012683bc10935dc9773.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Basic/Variantd6761bcf9dcb8a3a802a0c6f0f0759b847489cf2f9e98012683bc10935dc9773.lean#L750).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bcf49991f263cdec635073a6120ff920b3f2b1a4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
