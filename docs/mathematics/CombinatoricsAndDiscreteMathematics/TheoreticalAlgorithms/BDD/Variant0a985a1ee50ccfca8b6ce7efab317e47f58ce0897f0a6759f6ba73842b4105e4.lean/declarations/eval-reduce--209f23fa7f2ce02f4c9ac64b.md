## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:14b00cfb-62d9-12a4-4ca0-b798b34c15c5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 355–367.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] theorem eval_reduce [DecidableEq α]
    (ν : Valuation α)
    (d : BDD α) :
    BDD.eval ν (reduce d) = BDD.eval ν d := by
  induction d with
  | leaf b => rfl
  | branch a low high ihLow ihHigh =>
      by_cases h : reduce low = reduce high
      · have heq : BDD.eval ν high = BDD.eval ν low := by
          rw [← ihHigh, ← ihLow, h]
        cases hv : ν a <;> simp [reduce, h, hv, BDD.eval, ihHigh, heq]
      · cases hv : ν a <;> simp [reduce, h, hv, BDD.eval, ihLow, ihHigh]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/BDD/Variant0a985a1ee50ccfca8b6ce7efab317e47f58ce0897f0a6759f6ba73842b4105e4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/BDD/Variant0a985a1ee50ccfca8b6ce7efab317e47f58ce0897f0a6759f6ba73842b4105e4.lean#L355).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `03e3c5c10e83492b7984c8ed34c28a22658db796` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
