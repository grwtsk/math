## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:db2edaaf321213bc3975b4fde9ca67a517c52a88a93bbbf089890fc8b4fa9ae3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 39–49.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example (K L M : List α) (w : L.Disjoint M) (m : K ⊆ L) : True := by
  have? using w, m
  -- have : List.Disjoint K M := List.disjoint_of_subset_left m w
  have?! using w, m
  guard_hyp List.disjoint_of_subset_left : List.Disjoint K M :=
    _root_.List.disjoint_of_subset_left m w
  fail_if_success
    have : M.Disjoint L := by assumption
  have : K.Disjoint M := by assumption
  trivial

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Propose/Variant1d4c6c0d8baeec4d5958af8aa0a7a29d991fbb462ce725ab1fd8837a39b4c3f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Propose/Variant1d4c6c0d8baeec4d5958af8aa0a7a29d991fbb462ce725ab1fd8837a39b4c3f2.lean#L39).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `59ef5140c9556ee8c3063bae358626ad006e90d9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
