## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e6f40abb-4f5a-d312-d806-58517bb6221d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 168–179.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem apply_bucket [BEq α] [Hashable α] [PartialEquivBEq α] [LawfulHashable α] {m : Raw₀ α β}
    (hm : Raw.WFImp m.1) {a : α} {f : AssocList α β → γ} {g : List ((a : α) × β a) → γ}
    (hfg : ∀ {l}, f l = g l.toList) (hg₁ : ∀ {l l'}, DistinctKeys l → Perm l l' → g l = g l')
    (hg₂ : ∀ {l l'}, containsKey a l' = false → g (l ++ l') = g l) :
    f (bucket m.1.buckets m.2 a) = g (toListModel m.1.buckets) := by
  obtain ⟨l, hl, hlk⟩ := exists_bucket m.1.buckets m.2 a
  refine Eq.trans ?_ (hg₁ (hm.distinct.perm hl.symm) hl.symm)
  rw [hfg, hg₂]
  exact hlk hm.buckets_hash_self _ rfl

/-- This is the general theorem used to show that access operations involving a proof (like `get`)
are correct. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Model/Variant648473f8fe1c324e604e6e51922527fe93ad03daa1697418277b64744ebcf6f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Model/Variant648473f8fe1c324e604e6e51922527fe93ad03daa1697418277b64744ebcf6f2.lean#L168).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d94f298e36674840a00580338c5a67133982a1b4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
