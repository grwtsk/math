## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:22877320310eed35a90290c693c4b6db40e53b565aa2f9d9a869651d539bafa6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1740–1755.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
partial def readBinToEndInto (s : Stream) (buf : ByteArray) : IO ByteArray := do
  let rec loop (acc : ByteArray) : IO ByteArray := do
    let buf ← s.read 1024
    if buf.isEmpty then
      return acc
    else
      loop (acc ++ buf)
  loop buf

/--
Reads the entire remaining contents of the stream until an end-of-file marker (EOF) is
encountered.

The underlying stream is not automatically closed upon encountering an EOF, and subsequent reads from
the stream may block and/or return data.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/IO/Variant4612b91e65806364c814fc445b35598d8e26ee0f2a811ffde6c330d792dcddab.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/IO/Variant4612b91e65806364c814fc445b35598d8e26ee0f2a811ffde6c330d792dcddab.lean#L1740).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `64faef771c3b33af437dde294e5472dced69f6a5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
