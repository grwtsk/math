## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:796b9fc93f05a44c40c554855e5fea87926407d4a93d9dcef466ebb261d6551d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 300–329.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mapTasks (f : List α → BaseIO β) (tasks : List (Task α)) (prio := Task.Priority.default)
    (sync := false) : BaseIO (Task β) :=
  go tasks []
where
  go
    | [], as =>
      if sync then
        return .pure (← f as.reverse)
      else
        f as.reverse |>.asTask prio
    | [t], as => BaseIO.mapTask (fun a => f (a :: as).reverse) t prio sync
    | t::ts, as =>
      BaseIO.bindTask t (fun a => go ts (a :: as)) prio sync

end BaseIO

namespace EIO

/--
Runs `act` in a separate `Task`, with priority `prio`. Because `EIO ε` actions may throw an exception
of type `ε`, the result of the task is an `Except ε α`.

Running the resulting `IO` action causes the task to be started eagerly. Pure accesses to the `Task`
do not influence the impure `act`.

Unlike pure tasks created by `Task.spawn`, tasks created by this function will run even if the last
reference to the task is dropped. The `act` should explicitly check for cancellation via
`IO.checkCanceled` if it should be terminated or otherwise react to the last reference being
dropped.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/IO/Variant4612b91e65806364c814fc445b35598d8e26ee0f2a811ffde6c330d792dcddab.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/IO/Variant4612b91e65806364c814fc445b35598d8e26ee0f2a811ffde6c330d792dcddab.lean#L300).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `64faef771c3b33af437dde294e5472dced69f6a5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
