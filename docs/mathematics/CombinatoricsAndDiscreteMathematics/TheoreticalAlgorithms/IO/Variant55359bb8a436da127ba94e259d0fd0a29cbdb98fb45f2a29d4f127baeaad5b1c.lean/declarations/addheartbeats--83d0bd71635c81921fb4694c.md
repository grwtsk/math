## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:26e47b977d9c40631689bd5c7c322a2a6c2dd6bfc018aec2f03ee24839928c07`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 618–637.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def addHeartbeats (count : Nat) : BaseIO Unit := do
  let n ← getNumHeartbeats
  setNumHeartbeats (n + count)

/--
Whether a file should be opened for reading, writing, creation and writing, or appending.

At the operating system level, this translates to the mode of a file handle (i.e., a set of `open`
flags and an `fdopen` mode).

None of the modes represented by this datatype translate line endings (i.e. `O_BINARY` on Windows).
Furthermore, they are not inherited across process creation (i.e. `O_NOINHERIT` on Windows and
`O_CLOEXEC` elsewhere).

**Operating System Specifics:**
* Windows:
  [`_open`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/open-wopen?view=msvc-170),
  [`_fdopen`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/fdopen-wfdopen?view=msvc-170)
* Linux: [`open`](https://linux.die.net/man/2/open), [`fdopen`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/fdopen)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/IO/Variant55359bb8a436da127ba94e259d0fd0a29cbdb98fb45f2a29d4f127baeaad5b1c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/IO/Variant55359bb8a436da127ba94e259d0fd0a29cbdb98fb45f2a29d4f127baeaad5b1c.lean#L618).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6d2ee82102a22d30b73b8dbb945bec7209217636` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
