## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `initialize` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d3d53750dc2b2a6a82abbfe29c3b97f9cf74ae454e76867c764cf9e38dc4fdde`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 56–84.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
initialize CACHEDIR : FilePath ← do
  match ← IO.getEnv "MATHLIB_CACHE_DIR" with
  | some path => return path
  | none =>
    match ← IO.getEnv "XDG_CACHE_HOME" with
    | some path => return path / "mathlib"
    | none =>
      let home ← if System.Platform.isWindows then
        let drive ← IO.getEnv "HOMEDRIVE"
        let path ← IO.getEnv "HOMEPATH"
        pure <| return (← drive) ++ (← path)
      else IO.getEnv "HOME"
      match home with
      | some path => return path / ".cache" / "mathlib"
      | none => pure ⟨".cache"⟩

/--
A tag unique to this `cache` process, mixed into the names of every temporary file it writes into
`CACHEDIR`.

`CACHEDIR` is shared by design: it defaults to one directory per user
(`~/.cache/mathlib`), so every checkout, worktree, and CI job on a machine pools its
downloads there. Two `cache` runs can therefore be in flight in it at once, and until
they were tagged they wrote each other's files — one run's `curl.cfg` overwritten by the
other's before curl read it (so it fetched the wrong list, then reported the files it was
actually asked for as missing and rebuilt them), and, worse, two curls writing one
`<hash>.ltar.part` and renaming the interleaved result into place, leaving a corrupt
`.ltar` that every later run would find, trust, and fail to decompress.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/IO/Variantb4a0c1385a46e82e71ad1f7c29cee1eb9a9007161a29720b910fd7a1bb5ce494.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/IO/Variantb4a0c1385a46e82e71ad1f7c29cee1eb9a9007161a29720b910fd7a1bb5ce494.lean#L56).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `888035b399fe71628837ec9acb77cb6d5367dd65` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
