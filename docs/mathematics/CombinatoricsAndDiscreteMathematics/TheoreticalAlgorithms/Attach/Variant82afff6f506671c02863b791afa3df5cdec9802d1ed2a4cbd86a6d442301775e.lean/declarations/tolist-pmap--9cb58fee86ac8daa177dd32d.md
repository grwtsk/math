## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fd72ec5a-cdb7-3bbb-d13d-68571b907f79`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–95.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp, grind =] theorem toList_pmap {xs : Vector α n} {P : α → Prop} {f : ∀ a, P a → β} {H : ∀ a ∈ xs, P a} :
    (xs.pmap f H).toList = xs.toList.pmap f (fun a m => H a (by simpa using m)) := by
  rcases xs with ⟨xs, rfl⟩
  simp

/-- Implementation of `pmap` using the zero-copy version of `attach`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Attach/Variant82afff6f506671c02863b791afa3df5cdec9802d1ed2a4cbd86a6d442301775e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Attach/Variant82afff6f506671c02863b791afa3df5cdec9802d1ed2a4cbd86a6d442301775e.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `787dbef8c046074a405543d93401d8511220c787` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
