## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:37e72a168ec771b73133d83c6969ba04f79b29b8d0d08359e2d742954a7df07a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 25–39.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ShortWeierstrass (K : FieldLike.{u}) where
  A : K.Carrier
  B : K.Carrier
  discriminant : K.Carrier
  nonsingular : K.eq discriminant K.zero = false
  charNeTwoThree : Prop
  charBoundary : List String

/--
A short-Weierstrass curve over a law-carrying field interface.

This does not upgrade every `ShortWeierstrass` object. It creates the gate that
future arithmetic-geometry constructions must require before using field laws or
the characteristic restriction.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/EllipticCurve/Variant3152246b654478bf4266bb47e61fdb69a17ca0adb5711694a3b14306d294c427.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/EllipticCurve/Variant3152246b654478bf4266bb47e61fdb69a17ca0adb5711694a3b14306d294c427.lean#L25).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9e9701f0591679118e2e9cca08fc285cc69ef64f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
