## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5398a6846202a41b898dd3a8b0d7b40a4302af9c14f0cfc1bea889677b4a5073`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 562–573.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def symbolicFiniteField (p : Nat) : SymbolicFiniteField where
  characteristic := p
  cardinality := p
  label := "symbolic finite field of cardinality " ++ toString p
  requiresEnumerationForCounting := True
  requiresEnumerationForCountingCertified := trivial
  boundary := [
    "This descriptor names a finite field candidate.",
    "Point counting requires a separate finite enumeration certificate."
  ]

/-- Count elements satisfying a Boolean predicate over a certified finite enumeration. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Field/Variant942cdb024b30ebc7b6433c586da67d9114607c6aaa23cf0f57eaf91f64861736.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Field/Variant942cdb024b30ebc7b6433c586da67d9114607c6aaa23cf0f57eaf91f64861736.lean#L562).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b9926a3bca42651438233aab0c20d077755569f1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
