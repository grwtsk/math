## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f41bed84ff9bb99969877eca869c3e7fc5ffd96418a63337d789d4d962f80dd2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 98–105.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure FieldEqCertificate (K : FieldLike.{u}) where
  eq_true_iff :
    ∀ a b : K.Carrier, K.eq a b = true ↔ a = b
  eq_false_iff :
    ∀ a b : K.Carrier, K.eq a b = false ↔ a ≠ b
  boundary : List String

/-- A field-like package together with field laws and equality soundness. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Field/Variantf586d591fa8b7144f6b3b85a255e8435913146fd8af4e3db63fa669db04a3d70.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Field/Variantf586d591fa8b7144f6b3b85a255e8435913146fd8af4e3db63fa669db04a3d70.lean#L98).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1fb81d4aecefd021b17bcb6103c68357f55aca0e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
