## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dedf7ee5-d1ec-1878-7727-744851c06d31`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 963–969.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsPrefix.findIdx?_eq_some {l₁ l₂ : List α} {p : α → Bool} (h : l₁ <+: l₂) :
    List.findIdx? p l₁ = some i → List.findIdx? p l₂ = some i := by
  rw [IsPrefix] at h
  obtain ⟨t, rfl⟩ := h
  intro h
  simp [findIdx?_append, h]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Find/Variantbcde120a0abffbbdbea7fa98fc345a18ed30e848fe36a2d0b544c748fe847043.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Find/Variantbcde120a0abffbbdbea7fa98fc345a18ed30e848fe36a2d0b544c748fe847043.lean#L963).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7ceeb09718ee7d849c1834e40ca786aa32e47c75` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
