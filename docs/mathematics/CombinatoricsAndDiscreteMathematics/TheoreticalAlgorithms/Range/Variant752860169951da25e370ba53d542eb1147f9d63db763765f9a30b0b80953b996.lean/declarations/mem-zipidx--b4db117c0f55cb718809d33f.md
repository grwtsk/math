## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:91d66a08-43b6-6420-0162-3285f62cc9a8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 368–373.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_zipIdx {x : α} {i : Nat} {xs : List α} {k : Nat} (h : (x, i) ∈ xs.zipIdx k) :
    k ≤ i ∧ i < k + xs.length ∧
      x = xs[i - k]'(by have := le_snd_of_mem_zipIdx h; have := snd_lt_add_of_mem_zipIdx h; omega) :=
  ⟨le_snd_of_mem_zipIdx h, snd_lt_add_of_mem_zipIdx h, fst_eq_of_mem_zipIdx h⟩

/-- Variant of `mem_zipIdx` specialized at `k = 0`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Range/Variant752860169951da25e370ba53d542eb1147f9d63db763765f9a30b0b80953b996.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Range/Variant752860169951da25e370ba53d542eb1147f9d63db763765f9a30b0b80953b996.lean#L368).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5d7912fc8dab4abffd0d9bf645a60e8f89af64b6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
