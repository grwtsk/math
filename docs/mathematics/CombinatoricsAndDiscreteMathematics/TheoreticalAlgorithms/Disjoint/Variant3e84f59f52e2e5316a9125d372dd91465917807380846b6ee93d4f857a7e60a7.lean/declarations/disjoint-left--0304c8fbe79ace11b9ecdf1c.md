## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1dae72e5-eef9-5c43-f37c-286b554dd31e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 36–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem disjoint_left : Disjoint s t ↔ ∀ ⦃a⦄, a ∈ s → a ∉ t :=
  disjoint_iff_inf_le.trans <| forall_congr' fun _ => not_and

alias ⟨_root_.Disjoint.notMem_of_mem_left, _⟩ := disjoint_left

@[deprecated (since := "2025-05-23")]
alias _root_.Disjoint.not_mem_of_mem_left := Disjoint.notMem_of_mem_left

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Disjoint/Variant3e84f59f52e2e5316a9125d372dd91465917807380846b6ee93d4f857a7e60a7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Disjoint/Variant3e84f59f52e2e5316a9125d372dd91465917807380846b6ee93d4f857a7e60a7.lean#L36).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `621b71e17bbb5007cf8845047227721af75dc851` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
