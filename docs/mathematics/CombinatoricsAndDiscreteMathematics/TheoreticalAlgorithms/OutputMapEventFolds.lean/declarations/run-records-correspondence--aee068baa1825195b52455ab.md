## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c311a397-7397-16ff-8887-22820c593ee1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 298–315.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem run_records_correspondence {state final : Outputs} {history : List Event}
    (accepted : run state history = some final) :
    mergeOutputs (history.map Event.output) (records state.targets) = some (records final.targets) := by
  induction history generalizing state with
  | nil => simp [run] at accepted; subst final; rfl
  | cons event rest ih =>
      unfold run at accepted
      cases step : applyEvent state event with
      | none => simp [step] at accepted
      | some next =>
          simp [step] at accepted
          have inserted := insert_records_correspondence step
          have eta : (⟨event.output.area, event.output.path, event.output.object⟩ : Output) = event.output := by
            cases event.output; rfl
          simp only [outputKey] at inserted
          rw [eta] at inserted
          simp [mergeOutputs, inserted, ih accepted]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/OutputMapEventFolds.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/OutputMapEventFolds.lean#L298).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f259c2b2c6c62c0b7b012c54e3f9bc84ec55110d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
