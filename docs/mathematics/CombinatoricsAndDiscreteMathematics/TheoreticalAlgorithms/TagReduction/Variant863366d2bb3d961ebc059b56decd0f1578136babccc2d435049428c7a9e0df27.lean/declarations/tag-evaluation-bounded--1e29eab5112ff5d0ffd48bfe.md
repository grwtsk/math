## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:097dab38-2c8d-4924-cf92-f00af4d51fd2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 217–232.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tag_evaluation_bounded (assignment : List ℕ) (valid : TagAssignmentValid assignment)
    (term : Term) {value : ℕ}
    (evaluated : evaluateTerm FullFixtures.interpreterTable assignment term = some value) :
    value < 2 := by
  cases term with
  | «variable» index =>
    exact valid value (List.mem_of_getElem? evaluated)
  | nullary constructor => exact tag_table_output_bounded constructor [] evaluated
  | unary constructor argument =>
    cases input : evaluateTerm FullFixtures.interpreterTable assignment argument with
    | none => simp [evaluateTerm, input] at evaluated
    | some inputValue =>
      exact tag_table_output_bounded constructor [inputValue]
        (by simpa [evaluateTerm, input] using evaluated)

/-- The actual two-state interpreter cancels twice for every valid assignment. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/TagReduction/Variant863366d2bb3d961ebc059b56decd0f1578136babccc2d435049428c7a9e0df27.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/TagReduction/Variant863366d2bb3d961ebc059b56decd0f1578136babccc2d435049428c7a9e0df27.lean#L217).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dda9b2c122e73bc974535fb3ea379f898accc971` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
