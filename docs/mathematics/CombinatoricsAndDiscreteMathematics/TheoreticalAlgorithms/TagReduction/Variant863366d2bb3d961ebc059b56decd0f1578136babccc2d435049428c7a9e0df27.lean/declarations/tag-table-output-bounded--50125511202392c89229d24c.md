## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:771b91c9-afe4-1425-6c62-43dfc95a4f9f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 198–213.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem tag_table_output_bounded (constructor : ConstructorId) (inputs : List ℕ)
    {value : ℕ}
    (evaluated : tableOutput FullFixtures.interpreterTable constructor inputs = some value) :
    value < 2 := by
  unfold tableOutput at evaluated
  cases found : FullFixtures.interpreterTable.rows.find?
      (fun row => decide (tableRowKey row = (constructor, inputs))) with
  | none => simp [found] at evaluated
  | some row =>
    have member := List.mem_of_find?_eq_some found
    have outputs : ∀ row ∈ FullFixtures.interpreterTable.rows, row.output < 2 := by decide
    have sameOutput : row.output = value := by simpa [found] using evaluated
    rw [← sameOutput]
    exact outputs row member

/-- Assignments use actual carrier values; missing variableCount keep evaluation partial. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/TagReduction/Variant863366d2bb3d961ebc059b56decd0f1578136babccc2d435049428c7a9e0df27.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/TagReduction/Variant863366d2bb3d961ebc059b56decd0f1578136babccc2d435049428c7a9e0df27.lean#L198).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dda9b2c122e73bc974535fb3ea379f898accc971` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
