## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:acfb8bdc-4de5-ac1b-bb05-beb35b35d94b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 162–189.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mapAccumr₂_mapAccumr₂_right_right (f₁ : β → γ → σ₁ → σ₁ × φ) (f₂ : α → β → σ₂ → σ₂ × γ) :
    (mapAccumr₂ f₁ ys (mapAccumr₂ f₂ xs ys s₂).snd s₁)
    = let m := mapAccumr₂ (fun x y (s₁, s₂) =>
                let r₂ := f₂ x y s₂
                let r₁ := f₁ y r₂.snd s₁
                ((r₁.fst, r₂.fst), r₁.snd)
              )
            xs ys (s₁, s₂)
    (m.fst.fst, m.snd) := by
  induction xs, ys using Vector.revInductionOn₂ generalizing s₁ s₂ <;> simp_all

end Binary

end Fold

## Bisimulations
We can prove two applications of `mapAccumr` equal by providing a bisimulation relation that relates
the initial states.

That is, by providing a relation `R : σ₁ → σ₁ → Prop` such that `R s₁ s₂` implies that `R` also
relates any pair of states reachable by applying `f₁` to `s₁` and `f₂` to `s₂`, with any possible
input values.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/MapLemmas/Variant133b42de4a098660cddfe607cb76d81862acfd723e9fb4947e28b623c6a6de94.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/MapLemmas/Variant133b42de4a098660cddfe607cb76d81862acfd723e9fb4947e28b623c6a6de94.lean#L162).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `334bb83e0b3f42a646b6512b149373e08892426a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
