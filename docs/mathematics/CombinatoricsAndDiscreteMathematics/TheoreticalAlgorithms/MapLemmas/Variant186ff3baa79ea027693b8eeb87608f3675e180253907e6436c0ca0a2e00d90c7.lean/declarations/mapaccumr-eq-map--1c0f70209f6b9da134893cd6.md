## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:687035c4-b402-b3f0-da14-55132997c62d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 242–250.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mapAccumr_eq_map {f : α → σ → σ × β} {s₀ : σ} (S : Set σ) (h₀ : s₀ ∈ S)
    (closure : ∀ a s, s ∈ S → (f a s).1 ∈ S)
    (out : ∀ a s s', s ∈ S → s' ∈ S → (f a s).2 = (f a s').2) :
    (mapAccumr f xs s₀).snd = map (f · s₀ |>.snd) xs := by
  rw[Vector.map_eq_mapAccumr]
  apply mapAccumr_bisim_tail
  use fun s _ => s ∈ S, h₀
  exact @fun s _q a h => ⟨closure a s h, out a s s₀ h h₀⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/MapLemmas/Variant186ff3baa79ea027693b8eeb87608f3675e180253907e6436c0ca0a2e00d90c7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/MapLemmas/Variant186ff3baa79ea027693b8eeb87608f3675e180253907e6436c0ca0a2e00d90c7.lean#L242).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8561ab0dd90a9638b160dc4d521f724157313d4e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
