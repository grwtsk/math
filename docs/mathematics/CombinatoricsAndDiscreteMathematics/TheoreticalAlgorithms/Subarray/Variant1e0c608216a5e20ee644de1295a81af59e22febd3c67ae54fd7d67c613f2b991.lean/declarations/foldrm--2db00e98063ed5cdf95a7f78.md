## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e05410d773e8c031d6fd3c518a72f73a872e483ce98585cbbd1ed46f3f22e9b8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 205–228.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
def foldrM {α : Type u} {β : Type v} {m : Type v → Type w} [Monad m] (f : α → β → m β) (init : β) (as : Subarray α) : m β :=
  as.array.foldrM f (init := init) (start := as.stop) (stop := as.start)

/--
Checks whether any of the elements in a subarray satisfy a monadic Boolean predicate.

The elements are tested starting at the lowest index and moving up. The search terminates as soon as
an element that satisfies the predicate is found.

Example:
```lean example
#eval #["red", "green", "blue", "orange"].toSubarray.popFront.anyM fun x => do
  IO.println x
  pure (x == "blue")
```
```output
green
blue
```
```output
true
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Subarray/Variant1e0c608216a5e20ee644de1295a81af59e22febd3c67ae54fd7d67c613f2b991.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Subarray/Variant1e0c608216a5e20ee644de1295a81af59e22febd3c67ae54fd7d67c613f2b991.lean#L205).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a19f96df7f0c05a749bf437b769a085f21f6423c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
