## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c1ea254d-8e1a-0796-da62-38944a2c4bd2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1683–1686.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem getKey?_eq_none [BEq α] [PartialEquivBEq α] {l : List ((a : α) × β a)} {a : α}
    (h : containsKey a l = false) : getKey? a l = none := by
  rwa [← Option.not_isSome_iff_eq_none, ← containsKey_eq_isSome_getKey?, Bool.not_eq_true]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Associative/Variantb88354fef237968bca1f8b9bf5ae1eb6ec6de16248feaabb5b8fe2ee6dbd750e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Associative/Variantb88354fef237968bca1f8b9bf5ae1eb6ec6de16248feaabb5b8fe2ee6dbd750e.lean#L1683).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ddcb189e0bb3710a43ea511e7a5fcd0941f0a100` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
