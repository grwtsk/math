## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8bedc601-42b5-468f-9d7c-6530966b89d2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 426–431.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem quadratic_reciprocity {a b : ℕ} (ha : Odd a) (hb : Odd b) :
    J(a | b) = (-1) ^ (a / 2 * (b / 2)) * J(b | a) := by
  rw [← qrSign.neg_one_pow ha hb, qrSign.symm ha hb, quadratic_reciprocity' ha hb]

/-- The Law of Quadratic Reciprocity for the Jacobi symbol: if `a` and `b` are natural numbers
with `a % 4 = 1` and `b` odd, then `J(a | b) = J(b | a)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/JacobiSymbol/Variant953bd86aaa271c86da15e5f718d3c4433db0a716e42aba8bf8103e548c9bafe4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/JacobiSymbol/Variant953bd86aaa271c86da15e5f718d3c4433db0a716e42aba8bf8103e548c9bafe4.lean#L426).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `49f7e6056ff97178a0913ba5b0fbc6c18ebd0525` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
