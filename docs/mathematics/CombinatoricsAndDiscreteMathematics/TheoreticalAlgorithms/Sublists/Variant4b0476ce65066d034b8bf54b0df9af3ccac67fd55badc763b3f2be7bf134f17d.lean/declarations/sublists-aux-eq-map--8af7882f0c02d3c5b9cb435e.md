## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:62286918-1af9-f7c7-ea04-0cba0b241a2f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 64–70.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sublists'Aux_eq_map (a : α) (r₁ : List (List α)) : ∀ (r₂ : List (List α)),
    sublists'Aux a r₁ r₂ = r₂ ++ map (cons a) r₁ :=
  List.reverseRecOn r₁ (fun _ => by simp [sublists'Aux]) fun r₁ l ih r₂ => by
    rw [map_append, map_singleton, ← append_assoc, ← ih, sublists'Aux, foldl_append, foldl]
    simp [sublists'Aux]

@[simp 900]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Sublists/Variant4b0476ce65066d034b8bf54b0df9af3ccac67fd55badc763b3f2be7bf134f17d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Sublists/Variant4b0476ce65066d034b8bf54b0df9af3ccac67fd55badc763b3f2be7bf134f17d.lean#L64).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8449214eb8a5759434946d1473b56b3c6f23f447` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
