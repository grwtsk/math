## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4e1082a5-24a3-c2fa-daa0-efe7f45d0133`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 133–151.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem absorbSequence_inverse_forward
    {F : Type u}
    {Block : Type v}
    [AddGroup F]
    (P : F ≃ F)
    (inject : Block → F)
    (blocks : List Block)
    (state : F) :
    (absorbSequenceEquiv P inject blocks).symm
        (absorbSequenceEquiv P inject blocks state) = state :=
  (absorbSequenceEquiv P inject blocks).symm_apply_apply state

/-! ## Joint absorption is finite compression -/

/--
Absorbing an independent block together with the state into one finite state
cannot be injective when at least two blocks exist.  This argument uses only
domain/codomain cardinalities and does not assume a collision in `inject`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Commitment/Variant5ca7bdb9a6d03830e26b8c0fab4c932675b3a12df5187b5b6f33ddf1facbf6fb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Commitment/Variant5ca7bdb9a6d03830e26b8c0fab4c932675b3a12df5187b5b6f33ddf1facbf6fb.lean#L133).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3cacbeaa4e51076752ccf09343537249a1c4c8be` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
