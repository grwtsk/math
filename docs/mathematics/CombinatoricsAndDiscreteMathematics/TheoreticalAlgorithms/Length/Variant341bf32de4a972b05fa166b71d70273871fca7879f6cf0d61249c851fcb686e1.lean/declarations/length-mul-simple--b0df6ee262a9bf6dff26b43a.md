## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:91cc72fe-1b42-98d0-f70f-088741fbac28`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 192–207.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem length_mul_simple (w : W) (i : B) :
    ℓ (w * s i) = ℓ w + 1 ∨ ℓ (w * s i) + 1 = ℓ w := by
  rcases Nat.lt_or_gt_of_ne (cs.length_mul_simple_ne w i) with lt | gt
  · -- lt : ℓ (w * s i) < ℓ w
    right
    have length_ge := cs.length_mul_ge_length_sub_length w (s i)
    simp only [length_simple, tsub_le_iff_right] at length_ge
    -- length_ge : ℓ w ≤ ℓ (w * s i) + 1
    omega
  · -- gt : ℓ w < ℓ (w * s i)
    left
    have length_le := cs.length_mul_le w (s i)
    simp only [length_simple] at length_le
    -- length_le : ℓ (w * s i) ≤ ℓ w + 1
    omega

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Length/Variant341bf32de4a972b05fa166b71d70273871fca7879f6cf0d61249c851fcb686e1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Length/Variant341bf32de4a972b05fa166b71d70273871fca7879f6cf0d61249c851fcb686e1.lean#L192).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0ee1ce90caefbc97ce422900bcacfcc9e72ae0bf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
