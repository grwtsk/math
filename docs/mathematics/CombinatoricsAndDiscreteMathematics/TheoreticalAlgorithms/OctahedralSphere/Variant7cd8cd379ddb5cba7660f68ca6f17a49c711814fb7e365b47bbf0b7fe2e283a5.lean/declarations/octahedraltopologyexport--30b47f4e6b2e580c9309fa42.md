## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:68358ff10893a1f83ff1af734728d305319d75f6c384c13f772b6c224abc2e57`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 756–771.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def octahedralTopologyExport : OctahedralTopologyExport :=
  { schema := "surface-foundry.octahedral-sphere.v1"
    topologyObjectId := "boolean.cube.prismatic-geometry.octahedral-sphere"
    dimension := 2
    vertices := octahedralVertices.map octahedralVertexExport
    edges := octahedralEdges.map octahedralEdgeExport
    faces := octahedralFaces.map octahedralFaceExport
    charts := octahedralVertices.map octahedralRenderingChartExport
    eulerCharacteristic := 2
    closedOrientedSurface := true
    chartCoverComplete := true
    authorityBoundary :=
      "This is a finite oriented octahedral 2-sphere topology and exact unit-vector realization. It does not construct an analytic sphere, prismatic cohomology, or theorem authority."
    projectionLoss :=
      "A request-time cell field is aggregated onto eight octahedral faces. Cell-scale position, chart-scale variation, and analytic completion are not preserved by this projection." }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/OctahedralSphere/Variant7cd8cd379ddb5cba7660f68ca6f17a49c711814fb7e365b47bbf0b7fe2e283a5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/OctahedralSphere/Variant7cd8cd379ddb5cba7660f68ca6f17a49c711814fb7e365b47bbf0b7fe2e283a5.lean#L756).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `72309790f099b4ce7f2813ad59cee9b666a13c35` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
