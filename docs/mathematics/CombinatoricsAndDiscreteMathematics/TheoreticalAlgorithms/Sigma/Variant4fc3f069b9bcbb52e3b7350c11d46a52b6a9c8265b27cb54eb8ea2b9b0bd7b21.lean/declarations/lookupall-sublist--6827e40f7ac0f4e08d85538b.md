## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:932c3f1e-c52b-106b-45aa-046488c299ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 294–303.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lookupAll_sublist (a : α) : ∀ l : List (Sigma β), (lookupAll a l).map (Sigma.mk a) <+ l
  | [] => by simp
  | ⟨a', b'⟩ :: l => by
    by_cases h : a = a'
    · subst h
      simp only [ne_eq, not_true, lookupAll_cons_eq, List.map]
      exact (lookupAll_sublist a l).cons₂ _
    · simp only [ne_eq, h, not_false_iff, lookupAll_cons_ne]
      exact (lookupAll_sublist a l).cons _

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Sigma/Variant4fc3f069b9bcbb52e3b7350c11d46a52b6a9c8265b27cb54eb8ea2b9b0bd7b21.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Sigma/Variant4fc3f069b9bcbb52e3b7350c11d46a52b6a9c8265b27cb54eb8ea2b9b0bd7b21.lean#L294).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1056ade0a28e1ac0b53320425ffa360eee446a9d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
