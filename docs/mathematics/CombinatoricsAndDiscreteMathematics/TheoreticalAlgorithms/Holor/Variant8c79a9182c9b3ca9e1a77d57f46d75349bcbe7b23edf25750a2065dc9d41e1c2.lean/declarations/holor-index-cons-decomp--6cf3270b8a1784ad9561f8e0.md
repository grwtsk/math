## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cec1910e-0015-4d6b-00a5-fdd70a778fea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 185–191.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem holor_index_cons_decomp (p : HolorIndex (d :: ds) → Prop) :
    ∀ t : HolorIndex (d :: ds),
      (∀ i is, ∀ h : t.1 = i :: is, p ⟨i :: is, by rw [← h]; exact t.2⟩) → p t
  | ⟨[], hforall₂⟩, _ => absurd (forall₂_nil_left_iff.1 hforall₂) (cons_ne_nil d ds)
  | ⟨i :: is, _⟩, hp => hp i is rfl

/-- Two holors are equal if all their slices are equal. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Holor/Variant8c79a9182c9b3ca9e1a77d57f46d75349bcbe7b23edf25750a2065dc9d41e1c2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Holor/Variant8c79a9182c9b3ca9e1a77d57f46d75349bcbe7b23edf25750a2065dc9d41e1c2.lean#L185).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b3f28556d75481af55d82b50692184b6f44a68f2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
