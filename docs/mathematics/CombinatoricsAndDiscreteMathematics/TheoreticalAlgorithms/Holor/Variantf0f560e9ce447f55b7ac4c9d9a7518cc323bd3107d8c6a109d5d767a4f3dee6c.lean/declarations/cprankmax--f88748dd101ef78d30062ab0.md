## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f393241f44ebe11df4f2c1965e4e0aef2215d46b6e09bf7c9064abbf04173cae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 268–272.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive CPRankMax [Mul α] [AddMonoid α] : ℕ → ∀ {ds}, Holor α ds → Prop
  | zero {ds : List ℕ} : CPRankMax 0 (0 : Holor α ds)
  | succ (n : ℕ) {ds : List ℕ} (x : Holor α ds) (y : Holor α ds) :
    CPRankMax1 x → CPRankMax n y → CPRankMax (n + 1) (x + y)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Holor/Variantf0f560e9ce447f55b7ac4c9d9a7518cc323bd3107d8c6a109d5d767a4f3dee6c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Holor/Variantf0f560e9ce447f55b7ac4c9d9a7518cc323bd3107d8c6a109d5d767a4f3dee6c.lean#L268).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4a9a92d4f0b1f91325fb5ab9e978f497abf359e8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
