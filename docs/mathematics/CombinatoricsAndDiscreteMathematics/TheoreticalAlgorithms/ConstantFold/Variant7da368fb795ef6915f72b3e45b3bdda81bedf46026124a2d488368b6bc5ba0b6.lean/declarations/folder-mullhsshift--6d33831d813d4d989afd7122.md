## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:151617bc8e729933d0ee6e7e424732607242c79c800be4621c93535bedb749f4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 366–378.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Folder.mulLhsShift [Literal α] [BEq α] (shiftLeft : Name) (pow2 : α → α) (log2 : α → α) : Folder := fun args => do
  unless (← getDecl? shiftLeft).isSome do return none
  let #[.fvar fvarId, rhs] := args | return none
  let some lhs ← getLit fvarId | return none
  let exponent := log2 lhs
  unless pow2 exponent == lhs do return none
  let shiftLit ← mkAuxLit exponent
  return some <| .const shiftLeft [] #[rhs, .fvar shiftLit]

/--
If `x` is a power of two with the same exponent in both its 64 and 32 bit
interpretation, return that exponent.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/ConstantFold/Variant7da368fb795ef6915f72b3e45b3bdda81bedf46026124a2d488368b6bc5ba0b6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/ConstantFold/Variant7da368fb795ef6915f72b3e45b3bdda81bedf46026124a2d488368b6bc5ba0b6.lean#L366).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2e48b3f5ebb181f832035e7ec03ab80e8e687eb6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
