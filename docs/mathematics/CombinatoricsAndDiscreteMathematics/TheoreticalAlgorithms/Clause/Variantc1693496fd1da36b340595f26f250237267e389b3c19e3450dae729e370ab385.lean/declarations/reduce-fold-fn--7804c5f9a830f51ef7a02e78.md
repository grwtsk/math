## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bc656752cdf8810aa2e8c445e0fc380e9df041ced411b380168e755169284426`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 208–256.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def reduce_fold_fn (assignments : Array Assignment) (acc : ReduceResult (PosFin n))
    (l : Literal (PosFin n)) :
    ReduceResult (PosFin n) :=
  match acc with
    | .encounteredBoth => .encounteredBoth
    | .reducedToEmpty =>
      match assignments[l.1.1]! with
      | .pos =>
        if l.2 then
          .reducedToUnit l
        else
          .reducedToEmpty
      | .neg =>
        if !l.2 then
          .reducedToUnit l
        else
          .reducedToEmpty
      | .both => .encounteredBoth
      | .unassigned => .reducedToUnit l
    | .reducedToUnit l' =>
      match assignments[l.1.1]! with
      | .pos =>
        if l.2 then
          .reducedToNonunit -- Assignment fails to refute both l and l'
        else
          .reducedToUnit l'
      | .neg =>
        if !l.2 then
          .reducedToNonunit -- Assignment fails to refute both l and l'
        else
          .reducedToUnit l'
      | .both => .encounteredBoth
      | .unassigned => .reducedToNonunit -- Assignments fails to refute both l and l'
    | .reducedToNonunit => .reducedToNonunit

/--
The `reduce` function takes in a clause `c` and takes in an array of assignments and attempts to
eliminate every literal in the clause that is not compatible with the `assignments` argument.
- If `reduce` returns `encounteredBoth`, then this means that the `assignments` array has a `both`
  Assignment and is therefore fundamentally unsatisfiable.
- If `reduce` returns `reducedToEmpty`, then this means that every literal in `c` is incompatible
  with `assignments`. In other words, this means that the conjunction of `assignments` and `c` is
  unsatisfiable.
- If `reduce` returns `reducedToUnit l`, then this means that every literal in `c` is incompatible
  with `assignments` except for `l`. In other words, this means that the conjunction of
  `assignments` and `c` entail `l`.
- If `reduce` returns `reducedToNonunit`, then this means that there are multiple literals in `c`
  that are compatible with `assignments`. This is a failure condition for `confirmRupHint`
  (in `LRAT.Formula.Implementation.lean`) which calls `reduce`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Clause/Variantc1693496fd1da36b340595f26f250237267e389b3c19e3450dae729e370ab385.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
