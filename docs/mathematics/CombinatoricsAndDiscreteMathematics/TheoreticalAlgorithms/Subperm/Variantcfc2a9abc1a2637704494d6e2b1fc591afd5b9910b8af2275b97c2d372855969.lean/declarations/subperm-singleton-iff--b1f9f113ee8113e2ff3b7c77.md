## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:55d0e230-11a3-e0b6-0697-74a319257ea0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–51.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma subperm_singleton_iff : l <+~ [a] ↔ l = [] ∨ l = [a] := by
  constructor
  · rw [subperm_iff]
    rintro ⟨s, hla, h⟩
    rwa [perm_singleton.mp hla, sublist_singleton] at h
  · rintro (rfl | rfl)
    exacts [nil_subperm, Subperm.refl _]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Subperm/Variantcfc2a9abc1a2637704494d6e2b1fc591afd5b9910b8af2275b97c2d372855969.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/Subperm/Variantcfc2a9abc1a2637704494d6e2b1fc591afd5b9910b8af2275b97c2d372855969.lean#L44).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
