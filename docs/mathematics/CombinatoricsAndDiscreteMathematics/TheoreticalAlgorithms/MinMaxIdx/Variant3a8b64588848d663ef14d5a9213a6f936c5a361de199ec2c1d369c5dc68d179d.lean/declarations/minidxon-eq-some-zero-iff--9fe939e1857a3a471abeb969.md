## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:735cbdcc-b90b-5bf1-eb5e-a2f0ba100483`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 705–709.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem minIdxOn?_eq_some_zero_iff [LE β] [DecidableLE β] [IsLinearPreorder β]
    {xs : List α} {f : α → β} :
    xs.minIdxOn? f = some 0 ↔ ∃ h : xs ≠ [], ∀ x ∈ xs, f (xs.head h) ≤ f x := by
  simp [Option.eq_some_iff_get_eq, List.minIdxOn_eq_zero_iff]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/MinMaxIdx/Variant3a8b64588848d663ef14d5a9213a6f936c5a361de199ec2c1d369c5dc68d179d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/MinMaxIdx/Variant3a8b64588848d663ef14d5a9213a6f936c5a361de199ec2c1d369c5dc68d179d.lean#L705).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0b88f7fa1af57c91a6cad52f061d6e0d652c69a6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
