## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8063cc51319d9a4af53e437a23438c6c7b20af04f840bcebf2ec1277c3b04cf7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 190–196.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def parseStyleExceptions (lines : Array String) : Array ErrorContext := Id.run do
  -- We treat all lines starting with "--" as a comment and ignore them.
  Array.filterMap (parse?_errorContext ·) (lines.filter (fun line ↦ !line.startsWith "--"))

/-- Print information about all errors encountered to standard output.
`style` specifies if the error should be formatted for humans to read, github problem matchers
to consume, or for the style exceptions file. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/TextBased/Variantab7f49c916a67fc81a736d06d03f3b2db5b9f48059823fb0c4bda79395e1c2d0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/TextBased/Variantab7f49c916a67fc81a736d06d03f3b2db5b9f48059823fb0c4bda79395e1c2d0.lean#L190).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `75dc9ed61b984e5bf8f676826f52a00131c2b42f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
