## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a9240e5a99d4cd74f3b6d7f04b7a8913bbc53c0a2916e10e0567bd621a391586`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 280–287.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def EdgeRelaxation.DirectedHypercubeEdge.vertexAt {n : Nat}
    (e : EdgeRelaxation.DirectedHypercubeEdge n) :
    EdgeRelaxation.Line3 → Option (Hypercube.Point n)
  | .left => some e.source
  | .center => none
  | .right => some (EdgeRelaxation.DirectedHypercubeEdge.target e)

/-- The crisp activation profile attached to a directed hypercube edge. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/EdgeRelaxation/Variant89f83c840b2462752346145375851ec0516fc2eb2b3d0271805af584dc64cb83.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/TheoreticalAlgorithms/EdgeRelaxation/Variant89f83c840b2462752346145375851ec0516fc2eb2b3d0271805af584dc64cb83.lean#L280).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `13e86a394e68c0fd97d3424f93e69f2dbc11d9e4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
