## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:89e2bdc7-3cce-9a3d-e1b2-8fef965979db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 38–44.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Ico_subset_biUnion_Ico {X : Type*} [LinearOrder X] (N : ℕ) (a : ℕ → X) :
    Ico (a 0) (a N) ⊆ ⋃ i ∈ Finset.range N, Ico (a i) (a (i + 1)) := by
  induction N with
  | zero => simp
  | succ N ih => calc
    _ ⊆ Ico (a 0) (a N) ∪ Ico (a N) (a (N + 1)) := Ico_subset_Ico_union_Ico
    _ ⊆ _ := by simpa [Finset.range_succ] using union_subset_union_right (Ico (a N) (a (N + 1))) ih
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Union/Variant311c8d8aa87f77bd3c0f720217eec924a6dee18a448bdc15f505190ff4fdcb31.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Union/Variant311c8d8aa87f77bd3c0f720217eec924a6dee18a448bdc15f505190ff4fdcb31.lean#L38).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2d69c483706cc7935a5df8f4071ee3dfa3939102` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
