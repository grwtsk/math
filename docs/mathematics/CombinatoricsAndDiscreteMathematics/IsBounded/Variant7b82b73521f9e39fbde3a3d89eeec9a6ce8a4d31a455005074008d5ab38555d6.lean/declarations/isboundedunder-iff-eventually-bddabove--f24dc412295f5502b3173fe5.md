## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7b6b444e-8c31-ac6a-526b-bc3f20e30edd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 116–123.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isBoundedUnder_iff_eventually_bddAbove :
    f.IsBoundedUnder (· ≤ ·) u ↔ ∃ s, BddAbove (u '' s) ∧ ∀ᶠ x in f, x ∈ s := by
  constructor
  · rintro ⟨b, hb⟩
    exact ⟨{a | u a ≤ b}, ⟨b, by rintro _ ⟨a, ha, rfl⟩; exact ha⟩, hb⟩
  · rintro ⟨s, ⟨b, hb⟩, hs⟩
    exact ⟨b, hs.mono <| by simpa [upperBounds] using hb⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/IsBounded/Variant7b82b73521f9e39fbde3a3d89eeec9a6ce8a4d31a455005074008d5ab38555d6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/IsBounded/Variant7b82b73521f9e39fbde3a3d89eeec9a6ce8a4d31a455005074008d5ab38555d6.lean#L116).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8035e7527d4598572e2c50940cc0b700f58f8da3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
