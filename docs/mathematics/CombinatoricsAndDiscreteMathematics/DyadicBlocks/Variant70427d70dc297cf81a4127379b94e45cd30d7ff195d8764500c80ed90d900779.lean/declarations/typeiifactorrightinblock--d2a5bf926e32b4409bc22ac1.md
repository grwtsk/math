## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:498634475b0ea1646da900bdd8e42f7881da747732343d73c39ac2c8257a6aa7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 209–220.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def typeIIFactorRightInBlock {N : ℕ} (a : VaughanTypeIIFactorAtom N) :
    (typeIIFactorDyadicBlock a).Right :=
  ⟨a.1.2, ⟨dyadicLowerEndpoint_lt
      ((show 1 < 2 by decide).trans
        ((two_le_vaughanFourthRootCutoff N).trans_lt a.2.2.2)),
    le_twice_dyadicLowerEndpoint
      ((show 1 < 2 by decide).trans
        ((two_le_vaughanFourthRootCutoff N).trans_lt a.2.2.2))⟩⟩

end

end Surface.Core.TypeII
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/DyadicBlocks/Variant70427d70dc297cf81a4127379b94e45cd30d7ff195d8764500c80ed90d900779.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/DyadicBlocks/Variant70427d70dc297cf81a4127379b94e45cd30d7ff195d8764500c80ed90d900779.lean#L209).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ba01a79bd8791d800207ec1368316feae7c65e59` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
