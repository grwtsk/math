## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ae87b8ca8f3662f3910aada04dc71c63f719ee1b7a285880273d9a1c1d4799a9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 556–569.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def reductiveSelectionCertifiedBridge
    {State : Type u}
    {decomposition : FiniteDecomposition}
    {objective : SurgicalObjective State decomposition.Piece}
    (_plan : SurgicalSiteCandidatePlan State decomposition objective)
    (attestation : Attestation)
    (conclusion : Prop) :
    Option (CertifiedBridge attestation conclusion) :=
  none

/--
Reductive site selection classifies sites, not claims.  Passing a claim status
through the selection boundary therefore returns that exact status.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/SurgicalSitePlan/Variantebe44b4f762c137f941303628e34f9b86c47f49b1a90f43276dc5983dbcb5585.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/SurgicalSitePlan/Variantebe44b4f762c137f941303628e34f9b86c47f49b1a90f43276dc5983dbcb5585.lean#L556).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `71a0301e7107de58d9d1875e9b6b4bea4c8f9503` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
