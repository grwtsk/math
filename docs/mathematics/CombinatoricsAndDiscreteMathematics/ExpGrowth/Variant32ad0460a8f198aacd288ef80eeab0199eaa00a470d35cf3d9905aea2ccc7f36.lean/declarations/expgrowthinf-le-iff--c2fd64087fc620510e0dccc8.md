## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fc3d9ae8-f480-d392-654a-38b3e1e7e632`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 89–95.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma expGrowthInf_le_iff :
    expGrowthInf u ≤ a ↔ ∀ b > a, ∃ᶠ n : ℕ in atTop, u n ≤ exp (b * n) := by
  rw [expGrowthInf, liminf_le_iff']
  refine forall₂_congr fun b _ ↦ frequently_congr (eventually_atTop.2 ⟨1, fun n _ ↦ ?_⟩)
  rw [div_le_iff_le_mul (by norm_cast) (natCast_ne_top n), ← log_exp (n * b), mul_comm _ b]
  exact logOrderIso.le_iff_le

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/ExpGrowth/Variant32ad0460a8f198aacd288ef80eeab0199eaa00a470d35cf3d9905aea2ccc7f36.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/ExpGrowth/Variant32ad0460a8f198aacd288ef80eeab0199eaa00a470d35cf3d9905aea2ccc7f36.lean#L89).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dd5cf53041c29e332b01bfc2b89c76c8556cadd1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
