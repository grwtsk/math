## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5aa754a3-1118-4be0-e667-1bdd1c42a234`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 247–258.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma expGrowthInf_le_of_eventually_le (hb : b ≠ ∞) (h : ∀ᶠ n in atTop, u n ≤ b * v n) :
    expGrowthInf u ≤ expGrowthInf v := by
  apply (expGrowthInf_eventually_monotone h).trans
  rcases eq_zero_or_pos b with rfl | b_pos
  · simp only [zero_mul, ← Pi.zero_def, expGrowthInf_zero, bot_le]
  · apply (expGrowthInf_mul_le _ _).trans_eq <;> rw [expGrowthSup_const b_pos.ne' hb]
    · exact zero_add (expGrowthInf v)
    · exact .inl zero_ne_bot
    · exact .inl zero_ne_top

-- Bound on `expGrowthSup` under a `IsBigO` hypothesis. However, `ℝ≥0∞` is not normed, so the
-- `IsBigO` property is spelt out.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/ExpGrowth/Variant33df69c76753502d1042273712bec856c62e8dff3a24c07f59c81d1685ccb90f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/ExpGrowth/Variant33df69c76753502d1042273712bec856c62e8dff3a24c07f59c81d1685ccb90f.lean#L247).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `06cafd30b96333f94e3ff1f472d1decc87f2b6c6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
