## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:68d5cb5c-6aba-bce0-1fb2-835181d760e3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 347–358.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma expGrowthSup_add : expGrowthSup (u + v) = expGrowthSup u ⊔ expGrowthSup v := by
  rw [← expGrowthSup_sup]
  apply le_antisymm
  · refine expGrowthSup_le_of_eventually_le (b := 2) ofNat_ne_top (Eventually.of_forall fun n ↦ ?_)
    rw [Pi.sup_apply u v n, Pi.add_apply u v n, two_mul]
    exact add_le_add (le_max_left (u n) (v n)) (le_max_right (u n) (v n))
  · refine expGrowthSup_monotone fun n ↦ ?_
    exact sup_le (self_le_add_right (u n) (v n)) (self_le_add_left (v n) (u n))

-- By lemma `expGrowthSup_add`, `expGrowthSup` is an `AddMonoidHom` from `ℕ → ℝ≥0∞` to
-- `MaxTropical EReal`. Lemma `expGrowthSup_sum` is exactly `Finset.trop_inf`. We prove it from
-- scratch to reduce imports.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/ExpGrowth/Variant3a1b75994e6bdaacf089e45b084c8715a9427ce6645a2ba680205fdd30a83128.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/ExpGrowth/Variant3a1b75994e6bdaacf089e45b084c8715a9427ce6645a2ba680205fdd30a83128.lean#L347).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4efe499dd5e3357dbf32ce3cfc17f2b211e8e027` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
