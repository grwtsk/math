## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:137229f6-5f8f-33e1-59dd-111cfbefbf61`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 230–236.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem card_reconstructionMasks (C : Fin n → Finset X) :
    Fintype.card (ReconstructionMasks C) = 2 ^ (∑ i, (C i).card) := by
  rw [Fintype.card_pi]
  simp_rw [BlockMask, Fintype.card_fun, Fintype.card_bool, Fintype.card_coe]
  exact Finset.prod_pow_eq_pow_sum _ _ _

/-- Decode each source-block mask and union the resulting finite fragments. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Ownership/Variant0a7ebf8d54c957f5b243b2b31bdfefa91ab781d1c46232444c41d6e7028fc50e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Ownership/Variant0a7ebf8d54c957f5b243b2b31bdfefa91ab781d1c46232444c41d6e7028fc50e.lean#L230).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
