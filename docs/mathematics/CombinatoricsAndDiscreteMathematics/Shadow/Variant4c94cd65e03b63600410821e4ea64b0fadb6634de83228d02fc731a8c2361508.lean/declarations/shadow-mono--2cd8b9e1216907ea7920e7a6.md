## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d2cdee7c-9508-6cb8-ae1b-5197c1ef1e76`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 86–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[gcongr] lemma shadow_mono (h𝒜ℬ : 𝒜 ⊆ ℬ) : ∂ 𝒜 ⊆ ∂ ℬ := shadow_monotone h𝒜ℬ

/-- `t` is in the shadow of `𝒜` iff there is a `s ∈ 𝒜` from which we can remove one element to
get `t`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Shadow/Variant4c94cd65e03b63600410821e4ea64b0fadb6634de83228d02fc731a8c2361508.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Shadow/Variant4c94cd65e03b63600410821e4ea64b0fadb6634de83228d02fc731a8c2361508.lean#L86).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7739d157ae3d7453ba03ed395f3c8e8be1e69cb4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
