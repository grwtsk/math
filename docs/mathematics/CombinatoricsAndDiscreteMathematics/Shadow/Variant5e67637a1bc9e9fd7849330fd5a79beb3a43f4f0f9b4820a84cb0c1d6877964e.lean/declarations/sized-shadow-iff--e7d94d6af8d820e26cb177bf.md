## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c29741aa-63e7-d668-5901-b596e9b7de2b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 169–175.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sized_shadow_iff (h : ∅ ∉ 𝒜) :
    (∂ 𝒜 : Set (Finset α)).Sized r ↔ (𝒜 : Set (Finset α)).Sized (r + 1) := by
  refine ⟨fun h𝒜 s hs => ?_, Set.Sized.shadow⟩
  obtain ⟨a, ha⟩ := nonempty_iff_ne_empty.2 (ne_of_mem_of_not_mem hs h)
  rw [← h𝒜 (erase_mem_shadow hs ha), card_erase_add_one ha]

/-- Being in the shadow of `𝒜` means we have a superset in `𝒜`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Shadow/Variant5e67637a1bc9e9fd7849330fd5a79beb3a43f4f0f9b4820a84cb0c1d6877964e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Shadow/Variant5e67637a1bc9e9fd7849330fd5a79beb3a43f4f0f9b4820a84cb0c1d6877964e.lean#L169).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6c3af200d171331e0cb87b4ec52b18b98d383df6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
