## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:34b6c1d0e4b9d2c0862ef8fb233b78a354e7aaf4d4909a195627ea0bb9248834`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1829–1834.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def withTop' [OrderTop β] (f : LatticeHom α β) : LatticeHom (WithTop α) β :=
  { f.toSupHom.withTop', f.toInfHom.withTop' with }
#align lattice_hom.with_top' LatticeHom.withTop'

/-- Adjoins a `⊥` to the domain and codomain of a `LatticeHom`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Lattice/Variant107d5f4a6d171f22d01ae7fd4ece5df34b0bb4bb7c69278c399bf38083f64d98.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Lattice/Variant107d5f4a6d171f22d01ae7fd4ece5df34b0bb4bb7c69278c399bf38083f64d98.lean#L1829).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `74f72bdb94c804d871bc92f2ddd053a807c9bb80` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
