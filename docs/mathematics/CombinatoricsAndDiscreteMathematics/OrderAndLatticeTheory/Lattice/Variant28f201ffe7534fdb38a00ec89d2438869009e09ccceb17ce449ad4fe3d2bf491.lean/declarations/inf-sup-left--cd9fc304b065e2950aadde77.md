## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fe94bc78-941d-2fa5-c3bd-e0471092190e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 608–615.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem inf_sup_left (a b c : α) : a ⊓ (b ⊔ c) = a ⊓ b ⊔ a ⊓ c :=
  calc
    a ⊓ (b ⊔ c) = a ⊓ (a ⊔ c) ⊓ (b ⊔ c) := by rw [inf_sup_self]
    _ = a ⊓ (a ⊓ b ⊔ c) := by simp only [inf_assoc, sup_inf_right, eq_self_iff_true]
    _ = (a ⊔ a ⊓ b) ⊓ (a ⊓ b ⊔ c) := by rw [sup_inf_self]
    _ = (a ⊓ b ⊔ a) ⊓ (a ⊓ b ⊔ c) := by rw [sup_comm]
    _ = a ⊓ b ⊔ a ⊓ c := by rw [sup_inf_left]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Lattice/Variant28f201ffe7534fdb38a00ec89d2438869009e09ccceb17ce449ad4fe3d2bf491.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Lattice/Variant28f201ffe7534fdb38a00ec89d2438869009e09ccceb17ce449ad4fe3d2bf491.lean#L608).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `beb3c4ad0ddc1e422cbffb1af4ca8efb15c52672` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
