## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:79934de9-5643-8d7c-5280-f56269ffed4f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 725–751.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Distributive lattices
-/


/-- A distributive lattice is a lattice that satisfies any of four
equivalent distributive properties (of `sup` over `inf` or `inf` over `sup`,
on the left or right).

The definition here chooses `le_sup_inf`: `(x ⊔ y) ⊓ (x ⊔ z) ≤ x ⊔ (y ⊓ z)`. To prove distributivity
from the dual law, use `DistribLattice.of_inf_sup_le`.

A classic example of a distributive lattice
is the lattice of subsets of a set, and in fact this example is
generic in the sense that every distributive lattice is realizable
as a sublattice of a powerset lattice. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Lattice/Variantba1c8f4a407e7877daa2709d465d8ed44ba8899e51e44abb2470229b5138fa50.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Lattice/Variantba1c8f4a407e7877daa2709d465d8ed44ba8899e51e44abb2470229b5138fa50.lean#L725).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2af31c5703cc9af4c0e578c9b39f22ca3fd7304b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
