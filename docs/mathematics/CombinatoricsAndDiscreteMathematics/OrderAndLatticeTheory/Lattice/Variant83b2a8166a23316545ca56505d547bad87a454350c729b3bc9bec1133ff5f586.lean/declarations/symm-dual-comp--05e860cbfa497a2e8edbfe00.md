## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7289788f-7ae4-935a-7d30-d7118a7dfbd0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1398–1411.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem symm_dual_comp (g : InfHom βᵒᵈ γᵒᵈ) (f : InfHom αᵒᵈ βᵒᵈ) :
    SupHom.dual.symm (g.comp f) =
      (SupHom.dual.symm g).comp (SupHom.dual.symm f) :=
  rfl
#align sup_hom.symm_dual_comp SupHom.symm_dual_comp

end SupHom

namespace InfHom

variable [Inf α] [Inf β] [Inf γ]

/-- Reinterpret an infimum homomorphism as a supremum homomorphism between the dual lattices. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Lattice/Variant83b2a8166a23316545ca56505d547bad87a454350c729b3bc9bec1133ff5f586.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Lattice/Variant83b2a8166a23316545ca56505d547bad87a454350c729b3bc9bec1133ff5f586.lean#L1398).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d26713445055447572fff7e5c37c2fd6981c2790` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
