## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b568ab9ab2b8c67228609ac17a44c895abd45fb5714f426b177a6e27ee42e29b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 13–18.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure OrderEmbeddingSlice {α : Type} (xs : List α) where
  map : Slice xs → Slice xs
  preserves_le :
    ∀ {source target : Slice xs},
      Slice.le source target → Slice.le (map source) (map target)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/LatticeGroup/Variant6574b6a6f2d503db790265c1c61d198bcd6d67c25d1333b1619dc15b0fd8ea5f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/LatticeGroup/Variant6574b6a6f2d503db790265c1c61d198bcd6d67c25d1333b1619dc15b0fd8ea5f.lean#L13).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `43784eeedb9c053f376ce45b2eec6faf1b952f14` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
