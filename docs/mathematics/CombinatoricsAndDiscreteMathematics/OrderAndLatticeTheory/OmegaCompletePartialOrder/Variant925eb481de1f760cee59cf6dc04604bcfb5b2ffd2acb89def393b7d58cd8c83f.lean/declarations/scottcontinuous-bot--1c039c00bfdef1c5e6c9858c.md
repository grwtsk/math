## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:66514787-8990-6642-16ff-05c886af6c62`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 488–502.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma ωScottContinuous.bot : ωScottContinuous (⊥ : α → β) := by
  rw [← sSup_empty]; exact ωScottContinuous.sSup (by simp)

end CompleteLattice

namespace CompleteLattice

variable [OmegaCompletePartialOrder α] [CompleteLinearOrder β] {f g : α → β}

-- TODO Prove this result for `ScottContinuousOn` and deduce this as a special case
-- Also consider if it holds in greater generality (e.g. finite sets)
-- N.B. The Scott Topology coincides with the Upper Topology on a Complete Linear Order
-- `Topology.IsScott.scott_eq_upper_of_completeLinearOrder`
-- We have that the product topology coincides with the upper topology

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/OmegaCompletePartialOrder/Variant925eb481de1f760cee59cf6dc04604bcfb5b2ffd2acb89def393b7d58cd8c83f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/OmegaCompletePartialOrder/Variant925eb481de1f760cee59cf6dc04604bcfb5b2ffd2acb89def393b7d58cd8c83f.lean#L488).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `51705aa6cd242dc0035dc77dc1da86f500d38843` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
