## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2ba8b96f37a5eeeea80712b7aefe92c53b49fe19f84950823f23b2c6fe0ad015`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 188–201.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class OmegaCompletePartialOrder (α : Type*) extends PartialOrder α where
  /-- The supremum of an increasing sequence -/
  ωSup : Chain α → α
  /-- `ωSup` is an upper bound of the increasing sequence -/
  le_ωSup : ∀ c : Chain α, ∀ i, c i ≤ ωSup c
  /-- `ωSup` is a lower bound of the set of upper bounds of the increasing sequence -/
  ωSup_le : ∀ (c : Chain α) (x), (∀ i, c i ≤ x) → ωSup c ≤ x

namespace OmegaCompletePartialOrder
variable [OmegaCompletePartialOrder α]

/-- Transfer an `OmegaCompletePartialOrder` on `β` to an `OmegaCompletePartialOrder` on `α`
using a strictly monotone function `f : β →o α`, a definition of ωSup and a proof that `f` is
continuous with regard to the provided `ωSup` and the ωCPO on `α`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/OmegaCompletePartialOrder/Variantef583910667790656aee711fb47acff9665840f4c20743c068548b9f6a91e7f0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/OmegaCompletePartialOrder/Variantef583910667790656aee711fb47acff9665840f4c20743c068548b9f6a91e7f0.lean#L188).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ee61e1960a2e3adf55dcfe18ee22f5b737154067` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
