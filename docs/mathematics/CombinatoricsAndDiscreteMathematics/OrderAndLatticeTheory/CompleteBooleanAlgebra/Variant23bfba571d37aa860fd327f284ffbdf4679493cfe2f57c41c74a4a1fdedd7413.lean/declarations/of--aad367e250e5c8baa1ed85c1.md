## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b632834b87ce31b714323168d3f40bc32ef2a4bc1927c5977fc9617c2c7b9731`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–164.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def of [Frame α] : MinimalAxioms α where
  __ :=  ‹Frame α›
  inf_sSup_le_iSup_inf a s := _root_.inf_sSup_eq.le

end MinimalAxioms

/-- Construct a frame instance using the minimal amount of work needed.

This sets `a ⇨ b := sSup {c | c ⊓ a ≤ b}` and `aᶜ := a ⇨ ⊥`. -/
-- See note [reducible non instances]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/CompleteBooleanAlgebra/Variant23bfba571d37aa860fd327f284ffbdf4679493cfe2f57c41c74a4a1fdedd7413.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/CompleteBooleanAlgebra/Variant23bfba571d37aa860fd327f284ffbdf4679493cfe2f57c41c74a4a1fdedd7413.lean#L155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f30378af946c84a6bf133310b8b45bfefc9034fb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
