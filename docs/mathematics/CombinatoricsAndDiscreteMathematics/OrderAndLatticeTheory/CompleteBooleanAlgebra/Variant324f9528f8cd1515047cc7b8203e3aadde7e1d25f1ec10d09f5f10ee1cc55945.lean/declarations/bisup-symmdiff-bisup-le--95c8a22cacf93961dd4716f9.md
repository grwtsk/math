## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:72898a15-46c0-5a49-6a21-9a251617f9a4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 644–660.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem biSup_symmDiff_biSup_le {p : ι → Prop} {f g : (i : ι) → p i → α} :
    (⨆ i, ⨆ (h : p i), f i h) ∆ (⨆ i, ⨆ (h : p i), g i h) ≤
    ⨆ i, ⨆ (h : p i), ((f i h) ∆ (g i h)) :=
  le_trans iSup_symmDiff_iSup_le <| iSup_mono fun _ ↦ iSup_symmDiff_iSup_le

end symmDiff

end CompleteBooleanAlgebra

/--
A complete atomic Boolean algebra is a complete Boolean algebra
that is also completely distributive.

We take iSup_iInf_eq as the definition here,
and prove later on that this implies atomicity.

-- We do not directly extend `CompletelyDistribLattice` to avoid having the `hnot` field

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/CompleteBooleanAlgebra/Variant324f9528f8cd1515047cc7b8203e3aadde7e1d25f1ec10d09f5f10ee1cc55945.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/CompleteBooleanAlgebra/Variant324f9528f8cd1515047cc7b8203e3aadde7e1d25f1ec10d09f5f10ee1cc55945.lean#L644).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `72b9082d728256f9a78510b35272b52181d5d445` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
