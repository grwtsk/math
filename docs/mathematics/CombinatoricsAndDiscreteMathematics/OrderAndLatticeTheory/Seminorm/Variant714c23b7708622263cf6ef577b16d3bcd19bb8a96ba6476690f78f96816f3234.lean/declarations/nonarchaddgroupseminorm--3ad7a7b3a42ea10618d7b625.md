## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:debc131462ed0997b2748b21b920a89912f5fb5eacbfda0f72e6d3170c844c6c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 89–102.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure NonarchAddGroupSeminorm (G : Type*) [AddGroup G] extends ZeroHom G ℝ where
  /-- The seminorm applied to a sum is dominated by the maximum of the function applied to the
  addends. -/
  protected add_le_max' : ∀ r s, toFun (r + s) ≤ max (toFun r) (toFun s)
  /-- The seminorm is invariant under negation. -/
  protected neg' : ∀ r, toFun (-r) = toFun r

/-! NOTE: We do not define `NonarchAddGroupSeminorm` as an extension of `AddGroupSeminorm`
  to avoid having a superfluous `add_le'` field in the resulting structure. The same applies to
  `NonarchAddGroupNorm` below. -/


/-- A norm on an additive group `G` is a function `f : G → ℝ` that preserves zero, is subadditive
and such that `f (-x) = f x` and `f x = 0 → x = 0` for all `x`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Seminorm/Variant714c23b7708622263cf6ef577b16d3bcd19bb8a96ba6476690f78f96816f3234.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Seminorm/Variant714c23b7708622263cf6ef577b16d3bcd19bb8a96ba6476690f78f96816f3234.lean#L89).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `83504743801a6bc371f132d6f236f20444a6fc64` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
