## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3d6e4a52-04ea-504f-c81d-1b08c6b47f0b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 123–133.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sSup_div_semiconj [CompleteLattice α] [Group G] (f₁ f₂ : G →* α ≃o α) (g : G) :
    Function.Semiconj (fun x => ⨆ g' : G, (f₁ g')⁻¹ (f₂ g' x)) (f₂ g) (f₁ g) :=
  semiconj_of_isLUB f₁ f₂ (fun _ => isLUB_iSup) _
#align function.Sup_div_semiconj Function.sSup_div_semiconj

/-- Consider two actions `f₁ f₂ : G → α → α` of a group on a conditionally complete lattice by order
isomorphisms. Suppose that each set $s(x)=\{f_1(g)^{-1} (f_2(g)(x)) | g \in G\}$ is bounded above.
Then the map `x ↦ sSup s(x)` semiconjugates each `f₁ g'` to `f₂ g'`.

This is a version of Proposition 5.4 from [Étienne Ghys, Groupes d'homéomorphismes du cercle et
cohomologie bornée][ghys87:groupes]. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/SemiconjSup/Variantdb6b1d7f1470b33e0c0f720b9f42c4aa2e2344f56dc15b0b7522557e4cc9881a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/SemiconjSup/Variantdb6b1d7f1470b33e0c0f720b9f42c4aa2e2344f56dc15b0b7522557e4cc9881a.lean#L123).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bd8c4c4794465376a17e522c1dbe9cda33daaa6c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
