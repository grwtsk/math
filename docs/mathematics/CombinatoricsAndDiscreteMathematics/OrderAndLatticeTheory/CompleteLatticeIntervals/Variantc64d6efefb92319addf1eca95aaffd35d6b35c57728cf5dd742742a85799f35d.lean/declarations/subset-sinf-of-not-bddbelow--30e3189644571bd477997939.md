## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ec8f0ceb-2440-8c2f-5f4d-267b780ad1a0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 109–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem subset_sInf_of_not_bddBelow [Inhabited s] {t : Set s} (ht : ¬BddBelow t) :
    sInf t = default := by
  simp [sInf, ht]

end InfSet

section OrdConnected

variable [ConditionallyCompleteLinearOrder α]

attribute [local instance] subsetSupSet

attribute [local instance] subsetInfSet

/-- For a nonempty subset of a conditionally complete linear order to be a conditionally complete
linear order, it suffices that it contain the `sSup` of all its nonempty bounded-above subsets, and
the `sInf` of all its nonempty bounded-below subsets.
See note [reducible non-instances]. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/CompleteLatticeIntervals/Variantc64d6efefb92319addf1eca95aaffd35d6b35c57728cf5dd742742a85799f35d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/CompleteLatticeIntervals/Variantc64d6efefb92319addf1eca95aaffd35d6b35c57728cf5dd742742a85799f35d.lean#L109).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5ad090e9032aeb6c5f3d61482c33dc83e414e919` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
