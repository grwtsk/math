## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5061ea4103f85d8952a3f0e86255fbe20d3b41f65c6a3cfa30b4b6f72fb1b1d3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 31–41.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class GroupConeClass (S : Type*) (G : outParam Type*) [CommGroup G] [SetLike S G] : Prop
    extends SubmonoidClass S G where
  eq_one_of_mem_of_inv_mem {C : S} {a : G} : a ∈ C → a⁻¹ ∈ C → a = 1

export GroupConeClass (eq_one_of_mem_of_inv_mem)
export AddGroupConeClass (eq_zero_of_mem_of_neg_mem)

/-- A (positive) cone in an abelian group is a submonoid that
does not contain both `a` and `-a` for any nonzero `a`.
This is equivalent to being the set of non-negative elements of
some order making the group into a partially ordered group. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Cone/Variant2e7cfb8e0d8538860bf995c656b1b5c67507f828ef5a3be14dc999fe1d50a1ae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Cone/Variant2e7cfb8e0d8538860bf995c656b1b5c67507f828ef5a3be14dc999fe1d50a1ae.lean#L31).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cdccfc039595c1a9730c258e69cfb2a521b65efa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
