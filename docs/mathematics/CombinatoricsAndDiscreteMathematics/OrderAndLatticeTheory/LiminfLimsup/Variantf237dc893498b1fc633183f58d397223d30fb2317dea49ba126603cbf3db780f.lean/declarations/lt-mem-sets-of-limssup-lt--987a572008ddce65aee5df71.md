## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c6f733ae-6146-a5f5-5fd7-1737ebc171a4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 946–950.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lt_mem_sets_of_limsSup_lt (h : f.IsBounded (· ≤ ·)) (l : f.limsSup < b) :
    ∀ᶠ a in f, a < b :=
  let ⟨c, (h : ∀ᶠ a in f, a ≤ c), hcb⟩ := exists_lt_of_csInf_lt h l
  mem_of_superset h fun _a => hcb.trans_le'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/LiminfLimsup/Variantf237dc893498b1fc633183f58d397223d30fb2317dea49ba126603cbf3db780f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/LiminfLimsup/Variantf237dc893498b1fc633183f58d397223d30fb2317dea49ba126603cbf3db780f.lean#L946).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `173d0bad9d00e578f33453660721cea0cdeb4dad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
