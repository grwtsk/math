## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0a12325a-262f-9409-918d-cf6d323b0ffe`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 734–739.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem iInf_le_liminf {f : Filter β} {u : β → α} : ⨅ n, u n ≤ liminf u f :=
  le_liminf_of_le (by isBoundedDefault) (eventually_of_forall (iInf_le u))
#align filter.infi_le_liminf Filter.iInf_le_liminf

/-- In a complete lattice, the limsup of a function is the infimum over sets `s` in the filter
of the supremum of the function over `s` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/LiminfLimsup/Variant287edb4a5b16f2c44397b675c8fc8eec88ad4f0063ae25930f3fbafb54609771.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/LiminfLimsup/Variant287edb4a5b16f2c44397b675c8fc8eec88ad4f0063ae25930f3fbafb54609771.lean#L734).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a6c9b1c992f71b1d8cb64deba8c95c2f581e5cb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
