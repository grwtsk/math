## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eedb69b5-1a47-4c46-ce64-9bb46cd047f5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 39–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cmpLE_swap {α} [LE α] [IsTotal α (· ≤ ·)] [DecidableLE α] (x y : α) :
    (cmpLE x y).swap = cmpLE y x := by
  by_cases xy : x ≤ y <;> by_cases yx : y ≤ x <;> simp [cmpLE, *, Ordering.swap]
  cases not_or_intro xy yx (total_of _ _ _)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Compare/Variantdbe67c6cb177d48c4bfc3d05b8d981cd7af796e89b5790b645f8bc4c37ba1600.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Compare/Variantdbe67c6cb177d48c4bfc3d05b8d981cd7af796e89b5790b645f8bc4c37ba1600.lean#L39).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6a722b3b49802cdb31ca235b931b09f4abac92be` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
