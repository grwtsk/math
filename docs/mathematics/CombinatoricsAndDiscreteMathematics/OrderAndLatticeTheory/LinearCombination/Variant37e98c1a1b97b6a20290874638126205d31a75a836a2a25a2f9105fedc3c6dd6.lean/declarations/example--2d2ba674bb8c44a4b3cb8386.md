## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1ba64c8c55f26a3e8e436845f8d68103fa062fd9b5bb23f16db08b3275db4c47`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–162.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example [CommSemiring K] [PartialOrder K] [IsOrderedRing K]
    [AddCommMonoid V] [PartialOrder V] [IsOrderedCancelAddMonoid V] [Module K V] [OrderedSMul K V]
    {x y r : V} (hx : x < r) (hy : y < r) {a b : K} (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 ≤ b) (hab : a + b = 1) :
    a • x + b • y < r := by
  linear_combination (norm := skip) a • hx + b • hy + hab • r
  apply le_of_eq
  module

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/LinearCombination/Variant37e98c1a1b97b6a20290874638126205d31a75a836a2a25a2f9105fedc3c6dd6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/LinearCombination/Variant37e98c1a1b97b6a20290874638126205d31a75a836a2a25a2f9105fedc3c6dd6.lean#L155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5671cc2597639c6ecf94b7e9d444121cc6dafb8d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
