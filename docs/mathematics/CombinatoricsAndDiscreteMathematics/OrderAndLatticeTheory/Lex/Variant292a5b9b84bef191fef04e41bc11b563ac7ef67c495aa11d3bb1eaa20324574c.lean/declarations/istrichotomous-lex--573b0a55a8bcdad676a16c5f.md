## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d8a03e1f-a792-1571-df80-954bf3668844`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 82–98.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isTrichotomous_lex [∀ i, IsTrichotomous (β i) s] (wf : WellFounded r) :
    IsTrichotomous (∀ i, β i) (Pi.Lex r @s) :=
  { trichotomous := fun a b => by
      cases' eq_or_ne a b with hab hab
      · exact Or.inr (Or.inl hab)
      · rw [Function.ne_iff] at hab
        let i := wf.min _ hab
        have hri : ∀ j, r j i → a j = b j := by
          intro j
          rw [← not_imp_not]
          exact fun h' => wf.not_lt_min _ _ h'
        have hne : a i ≠ b i := wf.min_mem _ hab
        cases' trichotomous_of s (a i) (b i) with hi hi
        exacts [Or.inl ⟨i, hri, hi⟩,
          Or.inr <| Or.inr <| ⟨i, fun j hj => (hri j hj).symm, hi.resolve_left hne⟩] }
#align pi.is_trichotomous_lex Pi.isTrichotomous_lex

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Lex/Variant292a5b9b84bef191fef04e41bc11b563ac7ef67c495aa11d3bb1eaa20324574c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Lex/Variant292a5b9b84bef191fef04e41bc11b563ac7ef67c495aa11d3bb1eaa20324574c.lean#L82).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `58ea19c043f4b31161ac895a45c642826e3e3f47` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
