## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:64625e2d57c47d65532852a10cc138eeeabbeeff4783459ec7c29de953f0964d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 771–778.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instWellFoundedLT [LT α] [WellFoundedLT α] : WellFoundedLT (WithBot α) :=
  .intro fun
  | ⊥ => ⟨_, by simp⟩
  | (a : α) => (wellFounded_lt.1 a).rec fun _ _ ih ↦ .intro _ fun
    | ⊥, _ => ⟨_, by simp⟩
    | (b : α), hlt => ih _ (coe_lt_coe.1 hlt)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/WithBot/Variant04888dc906f21616c8fde024aa9ee2b6ac6431ae6fc071a74f7d686aad670c12.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/WithBot/Variant04888dc906f21616c8fde024aa9ee2b6ac6431ae6fc071a74f7d686aad670c12.lean#L771).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `de15ef9e9d7f0b373aece021cd5ff3df999cf5e6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
