## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:278c0a1b1e4ece27a021c415d4b9cce2db9cd7bfd43b2984aed7c244dc3bf244`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 464–470.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance decidableLE [LE α] [@DecidableRel α (· ≤ ·)] : @DecidableRel (WithBot α) (· ≤ ·)
  | none, x => isTrue fun a h => Option.noConfusion h
  | Option.some x, Option.some y =>
      if h : x ≤ y then isTrue (some_le_some.2 h) else isFalse <| by simp [*]
  | Option.some x, none => isFalse fun h => by rcases h x rfl with ⟨y, ⟨_⟩, _⟩
#align with_bot.decidable_le WithBot.decidableLE

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/WithBot/Variant5133380f84c1adcfecdcf93ab6db59c16d868f46ee7bb987944d7da0d7968dc2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/WithBot/Variant5133380f84c1adcfecdcf93ab6db59c16d868f46ee7bb987944d7da0d7968dc2.lean#L464).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `58d205ceffb53b0b831595c90c8b1dd52394162b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
