## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:10547985-f4a8-7d11-f6a2-caa68a19bea4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 41–46.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma fibration_iff_image_Iic [Preorder α] [Preorder β] (hf : Monotone f) :
    Fibration (· ≤ ·) (· ≤ ·) f ↔ ∀ x, f '' Iic x = Iic (f x) :=
  ⟨fun H x ↦ le_antisymm (fun _ ⟨_, hy, e⟩ ↦ e ▸ hf hy)
    ((H.isLowerSet_image (isLowerSet_Iic x)).Iic_subset ⟨x, le_rfl, rfl⟩),
    fun H ↦ fibration_iff_isLowerSet_image_Iic.mpr (fun x ↦ (H x).symm ▸ isLowerSet_Iic (f x))⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Fibration/Variant1948c8a42fc4e3bb0441ba1f9f7645d23c906bd40bf64949b6f47d6853e9c009.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Fibration/Variant1948c8a42fc4e3bb0441ba1f9f7645d23c906bd40bf64949b6f47d6853e9c009.lean#L41).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `79a1e7c541cfe4ea4e2ee78486c3adfaa85dc1c3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
