## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ae3ca2dc910f842164e206278e5a6030d5add9b68ede75588b471c2197ff05f4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 84–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class SupBotHomClass (F α β : Type*) [Max α] [Max β] [Bot α] [Bot β] [FunLike F α β] : Prop
  extends SupHomClass F α β where
  /-- A `SupBotHomClass` morphism preserves the bottom element. -/
  map_bot (f : F) : f ⊥ = ⊥

/-- `InfTopHomClass F α β` states that `F` is a type of finitary infimum-preserving morphisms.

You should extend this class when you extend `SupBotHom`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/BoundedLattice/Variant93799baabc48fc7adcef51aaa71cc62a82882dda252a484117647a6db960c533.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/BoundedLattice/Variant93799baabc48fc7adcef51aaa71cc62a82882dda252a484117647a6db960c533.lean#L84).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e663732895f971d05403d0edf6ffdbce32644704` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
