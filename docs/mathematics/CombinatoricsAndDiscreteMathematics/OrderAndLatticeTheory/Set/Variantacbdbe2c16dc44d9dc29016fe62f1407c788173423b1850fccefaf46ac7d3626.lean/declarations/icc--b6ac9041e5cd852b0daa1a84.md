## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e1518587d47254bc2c1d3d0c8e5687ab2315f31f4f3225bbda2841293e4ae75b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 197–212.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def Icc [Lattice α] [Lattice β] (e : α ≃o β) (x y : α) :
    Icc x y ≃o Icc (e x) (e y) where
  toFun z := ⟨e z, by simp only [mem_Icc, map_le_map_iff]; exact z.property⟩
  invFun z := ⟨e.symm z, by simp only [mem_Icc, e.le_symm_apply, e.symm_apply_le]; exact z.property⟩
  left_inv y := by simp
  right_inv y := by simp
  map_rel_iff' := by simp

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Set/Variantacbdbe2c16dc44d9dc29016fe62f1407c788173423b1850fccefaf46ac7d3626.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Set/Variantacbdbe2c16dc44d9dc29016fe62f1407c788173423b1850fccefaf46ac7d3626.lean#L197).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `569dbbfdaec3806e522bc0201961eac03fd68fb3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
