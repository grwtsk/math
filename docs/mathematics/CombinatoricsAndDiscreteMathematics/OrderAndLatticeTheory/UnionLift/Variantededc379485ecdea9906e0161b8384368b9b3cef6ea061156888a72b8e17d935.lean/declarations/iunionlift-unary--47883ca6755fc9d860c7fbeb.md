## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e7f7234f-e141-df3f-5b28-d3c7fcc4b0d6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 99–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem iUnionLift_unary (u : T → T) (ui : ∀ i, S i → S i)
    (hui :
      ∀ (i) (x : S i),
        u (Set.inclusion (show S i ⊆ T from hT'.symm ▸ Set.subset_iUnion S i) x) =
          Set.inclusion (show S i ⊆ T from hT'.symm ▸ Set.subset_iUnion S i) (ui i x))
    (uβ : β → β) (h : ∀ (i) (x : S i), f i (ui i x) = uβ (f i x)) (x : T) :
    iUnionLift S f hf T (le_of_eq hT') (u x) = uβ (iUnionLift S f hf T (le_of_eq hT') x) := by
  subst hT'
  obtain ⟨i, hi⟩ := Set.mem_iUnion.1 x.prop
  rw [iUnionLift_of_mem x hi, ← h i]
  have : x = Set.inclusion (Set.subset_iUnion S i) ⟨x, hi⟩ := by
    cases x
    rfl
  conv_lhs => rw [this, hui, iUnionLift_inclusion]

/-- `iUnionLift_binary` is useful for proving that `iUnionLift` is a homomorphism
  of algebraic structures when defined on the Union of algebraic subobjects.
  For example, it could be used to prove that the lift of a collection
  of group homomorphisms on a union of subgroups preserves `*`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/UnionLift/Variantededc379485ecdea9906e0161b8384368b9b3cef6ea061156888a72b8e17d935.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/UnionLift/Variantededc379485ecdea9906e0161b8384368b9b3cef6ea061156888a72b8e17d935.lean#L99).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7db0431687fcacd957e88c1f1bf50f798d63a5a6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
