## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:518ac0a3-53a7-d9d9-b6a4-c9c5bf454486`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 367–377.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem injective_toZ : Function.Injective (toZ i0) :=
  fun _ _ h ↦ le_antisymm (le_of_toZ_le h.le) (le_of_toZ_le h.symm.le)
#align injective_to_Z injective_toZ

end toZ

section OrderIso

variable [SuccOrder ι] [PredOrder ι] [IsSuccArchimedean ι]

/-- `toZ` defines an `OrderIso` between `ι` and its range. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/LinearLocallyFinite/Variant7e779c68726312234895b069091079f2f1b911e51286c5fbffa338e4569df400.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/LinearLocallyFinite/Variant7e779c68726312234895b069091079f2f1b911e51286c5fbffa338e4569df400.lean#L367).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `06205b18fd676a36811ea3165dd7b9c346f9fa41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
