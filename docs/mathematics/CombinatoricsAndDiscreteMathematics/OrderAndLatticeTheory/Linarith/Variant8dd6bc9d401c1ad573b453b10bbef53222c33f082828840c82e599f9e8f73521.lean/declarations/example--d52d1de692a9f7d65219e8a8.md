## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:204cafdb585f600693881709a8f783cd3e72c9d98b070d431d07d2e87b625811`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 581–588.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example (n : Nat) (h1 : ¬n = 1) (h2 : n ≥ 1) : n ≥ 2 := by
  have h4 : n ≥ 1 := h2
  by_contra h3
  suffices n = 1 by exact h1 this
  linarith

universe u v
-- simulate the type of MvPolynomial
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Linarith/Variant8dd6bc9d401c1ad573b453b10bbef53222c33f082828840c82e599f9e8f73521.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Linarith/Variant8dd6bc9d401c1ad573b453b10bbef53222c33f082828840c82e599f9e8f73521.lean#L581).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f1d27f7e53fb296a43d932e7b277c319729efcb0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
