## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ad3e4c15-4563-782f-d196-855171085ea3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 301–306.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem image2_lowerBounds_upperBounds_subset_upperBounds_image2 :
    image2 f (lowerBounds s) (upperBounds t) ⊆ upperBounds (image2 f s t) :=
  image2_subset_iff.2 fun _ ha _ hb ↦
    mem_upperBounds_image2_of_mem_upperBounds_of_mem_upperBounds h₀ h₁ ha hb

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Image/Variant83b522c820af0f57aac6fc7dcc1015bcd6ce9103c0e0d3c5000465e4af3cc1d8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Image/Variant83b522c820af0f57aac6fc7dcc1015bcd6ce9103c0e0d3c5000465e4af3cc1d8.lean#L301).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `28f8ca9136e79d8243680694ccb100d5f434362d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
