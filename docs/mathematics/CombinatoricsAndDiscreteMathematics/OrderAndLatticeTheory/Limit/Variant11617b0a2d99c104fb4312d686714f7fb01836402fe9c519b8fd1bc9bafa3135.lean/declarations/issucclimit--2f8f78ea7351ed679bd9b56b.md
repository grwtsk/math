## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a167b6dd1227a3220a14a016bce90b2840dd008b86c9692966728372962d109a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 91–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure IsSuccLimit (a : α) : Prop where
  /-- Successor limits aren't minimal. -/
  protected not_isMin : ¬ IsMin a
  /-- Successor limits don't cover any other elements. -/
  protected isSuccPrelimit : IsSuccPrelimit a

/-- A predecessor limit is a value that isn't maximal and isn't covered by any other.

It's so named because in a predecessor order, a predecessor limit can't be the predecessor of
anything larger.

Use `IsPredPrelimit` if you want to include the case of a maximal element. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Limit/Variant11617b0a2d99c104fb4312d686714f7fb01836402fe9c519b8fd1bc9bafa3135.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Limit/Variant11617b0a2d99c104fb4312d686714f7fb01836402fe9c519b8fd1bc9bafa3135.lean#L91).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0b7880702370b918231a2ea0bda048017e1df197` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
