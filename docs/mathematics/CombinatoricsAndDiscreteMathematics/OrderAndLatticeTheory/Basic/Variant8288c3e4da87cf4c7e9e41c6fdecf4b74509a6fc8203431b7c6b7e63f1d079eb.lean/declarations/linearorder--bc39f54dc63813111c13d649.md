## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:89242d88eb01dbe9c93882ec6df58b443bf6d1202dc03ce7f8aafab5ac849cfc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1368–1381.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance linearOrder: LinearOrder PUnit where
  le  := fun _ _ ↦ True
  lt  := fun _ _ ↦ False
  max := fun _ _ ↦ unit
  min := fun _ _ ↦ unit
  decidableEq := inferInstance
  decidableLE := fun _ _ ↦ Decidable.isTrue trivial
  decidableLT := fun _ _ ↦ Decidable.isFalse id
  le_refl     := by intros; trivial
  le_trans    := by intros; trivial
  le_total    := by intros; exact Or.inl trivial
  le_antisymm := by intros; rfl
  lt_iff_le_not_le := by simp only [not_true, and_false, forall_const]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variant8288c3e4da87cf4c7e9e41c6fdecf4b74509a6fc8203431b7c6b7e63f1d079eb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variant8288c3e4da87cf4c7e9e41c6fdecf4b74509a6fc8203431b7c6b7e63f1d079eb.lean#L1368).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1f36ff88bc019754e37ef905bc96e0be6b5e0c81` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
