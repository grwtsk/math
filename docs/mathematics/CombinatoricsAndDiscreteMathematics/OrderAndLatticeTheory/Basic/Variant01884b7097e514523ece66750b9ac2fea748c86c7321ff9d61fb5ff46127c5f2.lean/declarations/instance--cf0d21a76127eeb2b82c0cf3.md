## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f8ec65e1321bacb93aa3a267124be7e7387e2d8122db6fbbbc33d16b9cdac9c1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1071–1091.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : PredOrder (WithTop α) where
  pred a :=
    match a with
    | ⊤ => some ⊤
    | Option.some a => some (pred a)
  pred_le a :=
    match a with
    | ⊤ => le_top
    | Option.some a => coe_le_coe.2 (pred_le a)
  min_of_le_pred {a} ha := by
    cases a
    · exact ((coe_lt_top (⊤ : α)).not_le ha).elim
    · exact (min_of_le_pred <| coe_le_coe.1 ha).withTop
  le_pred_of_lt {a b} h := by
    cases a
    · exact (le_top.not_lt h).elim
    cases b
    · exact coe_le_coe.2 le_top
    exact coe_le_coe.2 (le_pred_of_lt <| coe_lt_coe.1 h)

/-- Not to be confused with `WithTop.pred_bot`, which is about `WithTop.pred`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variant01884b7097e514523ece66750b9ac2fea748c86c7321ff9d61fb5ff46127c5f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variant01884b7097e514523ece66750b9ac2fea748c86c7321ff9d61fb5ff46127c5f2.lean#L1071).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f84bf1acfeaf8625fc0ff6a0dd212c2412d22491` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
