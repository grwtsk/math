## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b9f2ed4a-62c0-f6b9-04fd-19867cc9fbce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1142–1149.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Monotone.ne_of_lt_of_lt_nat {f : ℕ → α} (hf : Monotone f) (n : ℕ) {x : α} (h1 : f n < x)
    (h2 : x < f (n + 1)) (a : ℕ) : f a ≠ x := by
  rintro rfl
  exact (hf.reflect_lt h1).not_le (Nat.le_of_lt_succ <| hf.reflect_lt h2)
#align monotone.ne_of_lt_of_lt_nat Monotone.ne_of_lt_of_lt_nat

/-- If `f` is an antitone function from `ℕ` to a preorder such that `x` lies between `f (n + 1)` and
`f n`, then `x` doesn't lie in the range of `f`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variantfb69dcb51b6bb92b357a4bee2ef109bd4e23431e11a2fcac96369c89fa4b9879.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variantfb69dcb51b6bb92b357a4bee2ef109bd4e23431e11a2fcac96369c89fa4b9879.lean#L1142).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `555d2a2ac28ba34802ef438276f5f0bb0a216ebf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
