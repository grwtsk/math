## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6e1193c554015e97c2ab7157dd540de879f108619d0e5a7a891aad9eb14170cc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1019–1062.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : SuccOrder (WithTop α) where
  succ a :=
    match a with
    | ⊤ => ⊤
    | Option.some a => ite (a = ⊤) ⊤ (some (succ a))
  le_succ a := by
    cases' a with a a
    · exact le_top
    change _ ≤ ite _ _ _
    split_ifs
    · exact le_top
    · exact some_le_some.2 (le_succ a)
  max_of_succ_le {a} ha := by
    cases a
    · exact isMax_top
    dsimp only at ha
    split_ifs at ha with ha'
    · exact (not_top_le_coe _ ha).elim
    · rw [some_eq_coe, coe_le_coe, succ_le_iff_eq_top] at ha
      exact (ha' ha).elim
  succ_le_of_lt {a b} h := by
    cases b
    · exact le_top
    cases a
    · exact (not_top_lt h).elim
    rw [some_lt_some] at h
    change ite _ _ _ ≤ _
    split_ifs with ha
    · rw [ha] at h
      exact (not_top_lt h).elim
    · exact some_le_some.2 (succ_le_of_lt h)
  le_of_lt_succ {a b} h := by
    cases a
    · exact (not_top_lt h).elim
    cases b
    · exact le_top
    dsimp only at h

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variantf869799ade25d9912fc7386ef6bf4cc38dde0439c4fd06d7f07b62ce35f53115.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variantf869799ade25d9912fc7386ef6bf4cc38dde0439c4fd06d7f07b62ce35f53115.lean#L1019).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6e5ba067c2ed0a76204be5b800d98975bce5ce2e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
