## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8d489d22-d9d8-293b-ff8c-6b65b4b9351b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 176–185.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem biSup_congr' {p : ι → Prop} {f g : (i : ι) → p i → α}
    (h : ∀ i (hi : p i), f i hi = g i hi) :
    ⨆ i, ⨆ (hi : p i), f i hi = ⨆ i, ⨆ (hi : p i), g i hi := by
  #adaptation_note /-- Before https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/13166
  (replacing grind's canonicalizer with a type-directed normalizer), `grind` closed this goal.
  It is not yet clear whether this is due to defeq abuse in Mathlib or a problem in the new
  canonicalizer; a minimization would help. The original proof was: `grind` -/
  simp_all

@[to_dual]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variant5726b3daa3ebeeca22b4a8182d8b7eeac8f031eb8a21a73e31d739a1a5de717e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variant5726b3daa3ebeeca22b4a8182d8b7eeac8f031eb8a21a73e31d739a1a5de717e.lean#L176).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f9c3e7ef0b053b43820e6f45054b6c046a30254` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
