## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a11fc1c0-a9d9-5dea-31f2-1a44e4bbbf7e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 207–223.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] theorem join_apply
    {σ : Type v} {β : Type w} [CompleteLattice β]
    (a b : σ → β) (s : σ) :
    (a ⊔ b) s = a s ⊔ b s := by
  apply PartialOrder.rel_antisymm
  ·
    have hfun : a ⊔ b ⊑ fun t => a t ⊔ b t :=
      join_le a b (fun t => a t ⊔ b t)
        (fun t => left_le_join (a t) (b t))
        (fun t => right_le_join (a t) (b t))
    exact hfun s
  ·
    apply join_le
    · exact (left_le_join a b) s
    · exact (right_le_join a b) s

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variantc1bdefbfbb8f9641a1d0fc74667775ad534bf26a756b62835fb153cec5203f80.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variantc1bdefbfbb8f9641a1d0fc74667775ad534bf26a756b62835fb153cec5203f80.lean#L207).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `10cf6bca559faef911fbb9eee2e661c427643f61` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
