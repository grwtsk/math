## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cf1c80c80c3647069436e4739c050c9d1cd4078aa3fd2dc3dbf31a4958000b65`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 526–530.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 90) OrderHomClass.toOrderHomClassOrderDual [LE α] [LE β]
    [FunLike F α β] [OrderHomClass F α β] : OrderHomClass F αᵒᵈ βᵒᵈ where
  map_rel f := map_rel f

/-- Embeddings of partial orders that preserve `<` also preserve `≤`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variant2e4f1456082fabee09b908241ce4cff8f5f64e5b46aea840eebb7d98742d97ed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variant2e4f1456082fabee09b908241ce4cff8f5f64e5b46aea840eebb7d98742d97ed.lean#L526).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4c3f4c33fac4ea9598a9ce3532ab7d57dc12b1ab` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
