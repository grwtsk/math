## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:24da9bc0de494227a9403cbd2442f69fafcf2c26efe119b3fde727173f0d7ff9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 165–174.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev CoheytingAlgebra.ofSDiff [DistribLattice α] [BoundedOrder α] (sdiff : α → α → α)
    (sdiff_le_iff : ∀ a b c, sdiff a b ≤ c ↔ a ≤ b ⊔ c) : CoheytingAlgebra α :=
  { ‹DistribLattice α›, ‹BoundedOrder α› with
    sdiff,
    hnot := fun a => sdiff ⊤ a,
    sdiff_le_iff,
    top_sdiff := fun _ => rfl }

-- See note [reducible non-instances]
/-- Construct a co-Heyting algebra from the difference and Heyting negation alone. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variant9a7500c76c87a5cdbc0141090b4469f3077e1b7b82ff64ea12db0257a035e3b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variant9a7500c76c87a5cdbc0141090b4469f3077e1b7b82ff64ea12db0257a035e3b9.lean#L165).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b6067f97ae83fdb4619eb8e4b234b12102cf754f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
