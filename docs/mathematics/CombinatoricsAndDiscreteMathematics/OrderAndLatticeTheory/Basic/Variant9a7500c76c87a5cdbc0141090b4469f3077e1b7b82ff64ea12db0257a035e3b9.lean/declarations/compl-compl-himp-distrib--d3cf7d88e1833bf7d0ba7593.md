## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ca4c8064-a45a-4f4f-349c-586b40c7f5cc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 707–715.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem compl_compl_himp_distrib (a b : α) : (a ⇨ b)ᶜᶜ = aᶜᶜ ⇨ bᶜᶜ := by
  apply le_antisymm
  · rw [le_himp_iff, ← compl_compl_inf_distrib]
    exact compl_anti (compl_anti himp_inf_le)
  · refine le_compl_comm.1 ((compl_anti compl_sup_le_himp).trans ?_)
    rw [compl_sup_distrib, le_compl_iff_disjoint_right, disjoint_right_comm, ←
      le_compl_iff_disjoint_right]
    exact inf_himp_le

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variant9a7500c76c87a5cdbc0141090b4469f3077e1b7b82ff64ea12db0257a035e3b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variant9a7500c76c87a5cdbc0141090b4469f3077e1b7b82ff64ea12db0257a035e3b9.lean#L707).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b6067f97ae83fdb4619eb8e4b234b12102cf754f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
