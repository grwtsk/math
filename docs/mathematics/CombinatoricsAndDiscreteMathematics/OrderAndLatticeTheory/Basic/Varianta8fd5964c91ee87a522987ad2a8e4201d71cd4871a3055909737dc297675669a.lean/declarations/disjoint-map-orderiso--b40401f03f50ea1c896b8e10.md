## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5bce6393-831d-d1f3-c2d9-4d27acf65892`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1273–1279.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Disjoint.map_orderIso [SemilatticeInf α] [OrderBot α] [SemilatticeInf β] [OrderBot β]
    {a b : α} (f : α ≃o β) (ha : Disjoint a b) : Disjoint (f a) (f b) := by
  rw [disjoint_iff_inf_le, ← f.map_inf, ← f.map_bot]
  exact f.monotone ha.le_bot

/-- Note that this goal could also be stated `(Codisjoint on f) a b` -/
@[to_dual existing] -- We can remove this use of `existing` once we get https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/32438
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Varianta8fd5964c91ee87a522987ad2a8e4201d71cd4871a3055909737dc297675669a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Varianta8fd5964c91ee87a522987ad2a8e4201d71cd4871a3055909737dc297675669a.lean#L1273).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5415f4a52dee6230b684f239cba5cd25e76c7ace` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
