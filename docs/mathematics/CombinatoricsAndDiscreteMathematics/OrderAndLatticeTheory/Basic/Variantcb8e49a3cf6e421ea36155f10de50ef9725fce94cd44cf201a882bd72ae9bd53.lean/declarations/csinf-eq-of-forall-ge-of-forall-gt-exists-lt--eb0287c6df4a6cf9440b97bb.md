## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b9ca97eb-b7e2-90b9-d289-8f6774d0c27e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 644–653.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem csInf_eq_of_forall_ge_of_forall_gt_exists_lt :
    s.Nonempty → (∀ a ∈ s, b ≤ a) → (∀ w, b < w → ∃ a ∈ s, a < w) → sInf s = b :=
  @csSup_eq_of_forall_le_of_forall_lt_exists_gt αᵒᵈ _ _ _
#align cInf_eq_of_forall_ge_of_forall_gt_exists_lt csInf_eq_of_forall_ge_of_forall_gt_exists_lt

/-- `b < sSup s` when there is an element `a` in `s` with `b < a`, when `s` is bounded above.
This is essentially an iff, except that the assumptions for the two implications are
slightly different (one needs boundedness above for one direction, nonemptiness and linear
order for the other one), so we formulate separately the two implications, contrary to
the `CompleteLattice` case.-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variantcb8e49a3cf6e421ea36155f10de50ef9725fce94cd44cf201a882bd72ae9bd53.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variantcb8e49a3cf6e421ea36155f10de50ef9725fce94cd44cf201a882bd72ae9bd53.lean#L644).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f713f6784c42e60eefbdd34523575e4a02b98319` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
