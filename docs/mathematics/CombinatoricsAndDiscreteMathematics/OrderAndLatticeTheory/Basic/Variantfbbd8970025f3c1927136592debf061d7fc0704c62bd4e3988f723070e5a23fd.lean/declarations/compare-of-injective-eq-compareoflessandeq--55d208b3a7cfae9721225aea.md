## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:044b4708-b0f3-2c5a-cbf5-dddd2a53e1c7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 749–770.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Transfer a `LinearOrder` on `β` to a `LinearOrder` on `α` using an injective
function `f : α → β`. This version takes `[Max α]` and `[Min α]` as arguments, then uses
them for `max` and `min` fields. See `LinearOrder.lift'` for a version that autogenerates `min` and
`max` fields, and `LinearOrder.liftWithOrd` for one that does not auto-generate `compare`
fields.

See also `Function.Injective.linearOrder` when only the proof fields need to be transferred.

See note [reducible non-instances]. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variantfbbd8970025f3c1927136592debf061d7fc0704c62bd4e3988f723070e5a23fd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variantfbbd8970025f3c1927136592debf061d7fc0704c62bd4e3988f723070e5a23fd.lean#L749).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f197e3f6d84d1acc2ad596c37d00870ad8c35335` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
