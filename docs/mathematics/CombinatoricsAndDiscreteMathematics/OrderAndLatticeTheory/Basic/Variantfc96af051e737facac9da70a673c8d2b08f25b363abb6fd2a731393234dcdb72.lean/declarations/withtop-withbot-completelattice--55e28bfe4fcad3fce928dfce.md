## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0f3fc51b0432e94fbddde23718a9c212a861110d346b0ff967928058615644b4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 870–892.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance WithTop.WithBot.completeLattice {α : Type*}
    [ConditionallyCompleteLattice α] : CompleteLattice (WithTop (WithBot α)) where
  isLUB_sSup S := ⟨fun a haS ↦ (WithTop.isLUB_sSup' ⟨a, haS⟩).1 haS, fun a ha ↦ by
    rcases S.eq_empty_or_nonempty with h | h
    · change ite _ _ _ ≤ a
      simp [h]
    · exact (WithTop.isLUB_sSup' h).2 ha⟩
  isGLB_sInf S := ⟨fun a haS ↦
    show ite _ _ _ ≤ a by
      simp only [OrderBot.bddBelow, not_true_eq_false, or_false]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variantfc96af051e737facac9da70a673c8d2b08f25b363abb6fd2a731393234dcdb72.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variantfc96af051e737facac9da70a673c8d2b08f25b363abb6fd2a731393234dcdb72.lean#L870).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4532a24b4e6a5d856c0ab223bbef2184588defbf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
