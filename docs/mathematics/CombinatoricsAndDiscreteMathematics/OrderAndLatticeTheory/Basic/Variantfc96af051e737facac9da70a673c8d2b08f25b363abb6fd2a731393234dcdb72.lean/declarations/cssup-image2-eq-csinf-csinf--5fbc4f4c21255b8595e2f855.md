## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6a2f23d5-9f9f-4bfd-1e76-2341af986814`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 803–831.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Complete lattice structure on `WithTop (WithBot α)`

If `α` is a `ConditionallyCompleteLattice`, then we show that `WithTop α` and `WithBot α`
also inherit the structure of conditionally complete lattices. Furthermore, we show
that `WithTop (WithBot α)` and `WithBot (WithTop α)` naturally inherit the structure of a
complete lattice. Note that for `α` a conditionally complete lattice, `sSup` and `sInf` both return
junk values for sets which are empty or unbounded. The extension of `sSup` to `WithTop α` fixes
the unboundedness problem and the extension to `WithBot α` fixes the problem with
the empty set.

This result can be used to show that the extended reals `[-∞, ∞]` are a complete linear order.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variantfc96af051e737facac9da70a673c8d2b08f25b363abb6fd2a731393234dcdb72.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Basic/Variantfc96af051e737facac9da70a673c8d2b08f25b363abb6fd2a731393234dcdb72.lean#L803).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
