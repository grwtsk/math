## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2589bc9d80a51c57d057e0fc49df9f922b06213151854cbe3bde5dc4676272b6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 162–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def conditionallyCompleteLatticeOfLatticeOfsSup (α : Type*) [H1 : Lattice α] [SupSet α]
    (isLUB_sSup : ∀ s : Set α, BddAbove s → s.Nonempty → IsLUB s (sSup s)) :
    ConditionallyCompleteLattice α :=
  { H1,
    conditionallyCompleteLatticeOfsSup α
      (fun a b => ⟨a ⊔ b, forall_insert_of_forall (forall_eq.mpr le_sup_right) le_sup_left⟩)
      (fun a b => ⟨a ⊓ b, forall_insert_of_forall (forall_eq.mpr inf_le_right) inf_le_left⟩)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Defs/Variant9a69d25c4afe72504d2c2ed512f84f25b092fe149908024cbcf96e1510687df0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Defs/Variant9a69d25c4afe72504d2c2ed512f84f25b092fe149908024cbcf96e1510687df0.lean#L162).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9f4fea77303a17484f4a1432aaf59884064a2a29` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
