## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4a125321-edfc-0084-ddab-b5eb0c3be43d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1089–1099.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma PosSMulReflectLT.lift [PosSMulReflectLT α γ]
    (hf : ∀ {b₁ b₂}, f b₁ ≤ f b₂ ↔ b₁ ≤ b₂)
    (smul : ∀ (a : α) b, f (a • b) = a • f b) : PosSMulReflectLT α β where
  elim a ha b₁ b₂ h := by
    simp only [← lt_iff_lt_of_le_iff_le' hf hf, smul] at *; exact lt_of_smul_lt_smul_left h ha

end

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Defs/Variant869ae709e9a097afff94bc4d91912487095e6269baaa64c5202c184526c9636a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Defs/Variant869ae709e9a097afff94bc4d91912487095e6269baaa64c5202c184526c9636a.lean#L1089).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6b6b0628da8cc0d11557e860093e063e2266ea3b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
