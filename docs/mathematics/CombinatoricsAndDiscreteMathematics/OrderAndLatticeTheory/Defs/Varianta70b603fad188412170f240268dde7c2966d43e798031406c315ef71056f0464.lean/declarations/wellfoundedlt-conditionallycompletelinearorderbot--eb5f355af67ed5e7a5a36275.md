## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c16b32723fa4dab5bd265ed2f56083ed9f55197db12e5ff37710c26a46461663`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 98–140.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Create a `ConditionallyCompleteLattice` from a `PartialOrder` and `sup` function
that returns the least upper bound of a nonempty set which is bounded above. Usually this
constructor provides poor definitional equalities.  If other fields are known explicitly, they
should be provided; for example, if `inf` is known explicitly, construct the
`ConditionallyCompleteLattice` instance as
```
instance : ConditionallyCompleteLattice my_T :=
  { inf := better_inf,
    le_inf := ...,
    inf_le_right := ...,
    inf_le_left := ...
    -- don't care to fix sup, sInf
    ..conditionallyCompleteLatticeOfsSup my_T _ }
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Defs/Varianta70b603fad188412170f240268dde7c2966d43e798031406c315ef71056f0464.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Defs/Varianta70b603fad188412170f240268dde7c2966d43e798031406c315ef71056f0464.lean#L98).
