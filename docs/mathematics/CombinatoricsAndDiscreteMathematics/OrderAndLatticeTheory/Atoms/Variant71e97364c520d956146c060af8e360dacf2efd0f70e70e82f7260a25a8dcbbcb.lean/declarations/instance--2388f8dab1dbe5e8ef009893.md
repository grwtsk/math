## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8da1d5b5166ef33bc74b322afd5f1d84a8df3eb84755c7c68ffe90055260ee2b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 546–558.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) : IsAtomic α :=
  ⟨fun b => by
    rcases isLUB_atoms b with ⟨s, hsb, hs⟩
    rcases s.eq_empty_or_nonempty with rfl | ⟨a, ha⟩
    · simp_all
    · exact Or.inr ⟨a, hs _ ha, hsb.1 ha⟩⟩

end IsAtomistic

section IsAtomistic

variable [OrderBot α] [IsAtomistic α]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Atoms/Variant71e97364c520d956146c060af8e360dacf2efd0f70e70e82f7260a25a8dcbbcb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Atoms/Variant71e97364c520d956146c060af8e360dacf2efd0f70e70e82f7260a25a8dcbbcb.lean#L546).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `88b69555acbf74bb36c42cb127791ce8268a985a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
