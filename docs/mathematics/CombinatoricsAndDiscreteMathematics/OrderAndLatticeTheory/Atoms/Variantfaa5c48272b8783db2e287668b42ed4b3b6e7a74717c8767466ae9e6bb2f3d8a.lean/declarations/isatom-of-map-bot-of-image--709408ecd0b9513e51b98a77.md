## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:581966e2-3151-019a-8177-d9a6420acf41`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 793–798.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isAtom_of_map_bot_of_image [OrderBot α] [OrderBot β] (f : β ↪o α) (hbot : f ⊥ = ⊥) {b : β}
    (hb : IsAtom (f b)) : IsAtom b := by
  simp only [← bot_covby_iff] at hb ⊢
  exact Covby.of_image f (hbot.symm ▸ hb)
#align order_embedding.is_atom_of_map_bot_of_image OrderEmbedding.isAtom_of_map_bot_of_image

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Atoms/Variantfaa5c48272b8783db2e287668b42ed4b3b6e7a74717c8767466ae9e6bb2f3d8a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Atoms/Variantfaa5c48272b8783db2e287668b42ed4b3b6e7a74717c8767466ae9e6bb2f3d8a.lean#L793).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bb2be85d80a96aaf07ed1ca45de2ad6845a80f1c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
