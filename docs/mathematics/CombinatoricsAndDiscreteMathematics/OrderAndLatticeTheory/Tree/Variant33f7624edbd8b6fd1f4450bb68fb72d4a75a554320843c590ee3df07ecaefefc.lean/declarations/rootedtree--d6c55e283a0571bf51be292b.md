## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dfbb8e62fcaff1ae4e71f033bcf3694b4672e1a1d7704a64f8dab736adc7bc92`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure RootedTree where
  /-- The type representing the elements in the tree. -/
  α : Type*
  /-- The type should be a `SemilatticeInf`,
    where `inf` is the least common ancestor in the tree. -/
  [semilatticeInf : SemilatticeInf α]
  /-- The type should have a bottom, the root. -/
  [orderBot : OrderBot α]
  /-- The type should have a predecessor for every element, its parent. -/
  [predOrder : PredOrder α]
  /-- The predecessor relationship should be archimedean. -/
  [isPredArchimedean : IsPredArchimedean α]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Tree/Variant33f7624edbd8b6fd1f4450bb68fb72d4a75a554320843c590ee3df07ecaefefc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Tree/Variant33f7624edbd8b6fd1f4450bb68fb72d4a75a554320843c590ee3df07ecaefefc.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8c15357418c9f4dbebea0d1fd6988c71d57192a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
