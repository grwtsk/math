## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:968b3c71048279c5fc4befd0dee3a8df270268fcf05ad1bf2b8ad7f5d40ce238`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 109–131.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class CircularPreorder (α : Type*) extends Btw α, SBtw α where
  /-- `a` is between `a` and `a`. -/
  btw_refl (a : α) : btw a a a
  /-- If `b` is between `a` and `c`, then `c` is between `b` and `a`.
  This is motivated by imagining three points on a circle. -/
  btw_cyclic_left {a b c : α} : btw a b c → btw b c a
  sbtw := fun a b c => btw a b c ∧ ¬btw c b a
  /-- Strict betweenness is given by betweenness in one direction and non-betweenness in the other.

  I.e., if `b` is between `a` and `c` but not between `c` and `a`, then we say `b` is strictly
  between `a` and `c`. -/
  sbtw_iff_btw_not_btw {a b c : α} : sbtw a b c ↔ btw a b c ∧ ¬btw c b a := by intros; rfl
  /-- For any fixed `c`, `fun a b ↦ sbtw a b c` is a transitive relation.

  I.e., given `a` `b` `d` `c` in that "order", if we have `b` strictly between `a` and `c`, and `d`
  strictly between `b` and `c`, then `d` is strictly between `a` and `c`. -/
  sbtw_trans_left {a b c d : α} : sbtw a b c → sbtw b d c → sbtw a d c

export CircularPreorder (btw_refl btw_cyclic_left sbtw_trans_left)

/-- A circular partial order is the analogue of a partial order where you can loop around. `≤` and
`<` are replaced by ternary relations `btw` and `sbtw`. `btw` is reflexive, cyclic and
antisymmetric. `sbtw` is transitive. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Circular/Variant55cc413a000f30e7c0c6e827671cd60f7c33f62ed16a21cfb8caee456f81a7b5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Circular/Variant55cc413a000f30e7c0c6e827671cd60f7c33f62ed16a21cfb8caee456f81a7b5.lean#L109).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3bc88567558a4b17bea589ab0166593f83aff8cb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
