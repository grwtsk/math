## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0409b7dfa9c0e41a2f6d0044ed243b9def805dfae31654ac2c60fdf50398c21d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–131.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [∀ i, Preorder (α i)] [∀ i, DenselyOrdered (α i)] : DenselyOrdered (Σi, α i) where
  dense := by
    rintro ⟨i, a⟩ ⟨_, _⟩ ⟨_, _, b, h⟩
    obtain ⟨c, ha, hb⟩ := exists_between h
    exact ⟨⟨i, c⟩, LT.fiber i a c ha, LT.fiber i c b hb⟩

/-! ### Lexicographical order on `Sigma` -/


namespace Lex
/-- The notation `Σₗ i, α i` refers to a sigma type equipped with the lexicographic order. -/
notation3 "Σₗ "(...)", "r:(scoped p => _root_.Lex (Sigma p)) => r

/-- The lexicographical `≤` on a sigma type. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Order/Variant484a84151caf8b884e0ead8bd2b5d73ba15a6b97476a1592804ec465f44dc206.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Order/Variant484a84151caf8b884e0ead8bd2b5d73ba15a6b97476a1592804ec465f44dc206.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `066d8dc25cd143224d57cdf6ad87f250dc9d3dce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
