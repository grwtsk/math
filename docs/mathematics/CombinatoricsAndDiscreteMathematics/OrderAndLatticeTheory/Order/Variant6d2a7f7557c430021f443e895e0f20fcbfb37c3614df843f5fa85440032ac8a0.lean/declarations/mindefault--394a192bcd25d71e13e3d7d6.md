## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9c262c19616fa68d5739145f7b1a25eb76dfd098458593b0fdbc97905a412a90`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 251–262.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def minDefault {α : Type u} [LE α] [DecidableRel ((· ≤ ·) : α → α → Prop)] (a b : α) :=
  if a ≤ b then a else b

/-- This attempts to prove that a given instance of `compare` is equal to `compareOfLessAndEq` by
introducing the arguments and trying the following approaches in order:

1. seeing if `rfl` works
2. seeing if the `compare` at hand is nonetheless essentially `compareOfLessAndEq`, but, because of
implicit arguments, requires us to unfold the defs and split the `if`s in the definition of
`compareOfLessAndEq`
3. seeing if we can split by cases on the arguments, then see if the defs work themselves out
  (useful when `compare` is defined via a `match` statement, as it is for `Bool`) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Order/Variant6d2a7f7557c430021f443e895e0f20fcbfb37c3614df843f5fa85440032ac8a0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Order/Variant6d2a7f7557c430021f443e895e0f20fcbfb37c3614df843f5fa85440032ac8a0.lean#L251).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d7f20d7f99f65fa7b482c9f51e8a503b279abde4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
