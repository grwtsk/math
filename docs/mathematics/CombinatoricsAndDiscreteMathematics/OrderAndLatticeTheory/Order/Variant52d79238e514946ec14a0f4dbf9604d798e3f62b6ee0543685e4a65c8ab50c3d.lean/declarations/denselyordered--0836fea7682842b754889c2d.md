## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:46bbd9d78915e6b62f2a7a08c79163534ea5d73b178e384248d801892489c1a7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 253–265.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance denselyOrdered [LT α] [LT β] [DenselyOrdered α] [DenselyOrdered β] :
    DenselyOrdered (Sum α β) :=
  ⟨fun a b h =>
    match a, b, h with
    | inl _, inl _, LiftRel.inl h =>
      let ⟨c, ha, hb⟩ := exists_between h
      ⟨toLex (inl c), LiftRel.inl ha, LiftRel.inl hb⟩
    | inr _, inr _, LiftRel.inr h =>
      let ⟨c, ha, hb⟩ := exists_between h
      ⟨toLex (inr c), LiftRel.inr ha, LiftRel.inr hb⟩⟩
#align sum.densely_ordered Sum.denselyOrdered

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Order/Variant52d79238e514946ec14a0f4dbf9604d798e3f62b6ee0543685e4a65c8ab50c3d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Order/Variant52d79238e514946ec14a0f4dbf9604d798e3f62b6ee0543685e4a65c8ab50c3d.lean#L253).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7b74d4da4dc41f40731572271632a8e05634174e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
