## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:12511ce0-8aba-4064-9a3b-c02275150fec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 77–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem transGen_of_succ_of_ne (r : α → α → Prop) {n m : α} (h1 : ∀ i ∈ Ico n m, r i (succ i))
    (h2 : ∀ i ∈ Ico m n, r (succ i) i) (hnm : n ≠ m) : TransGen r n m :=
  (reflTransGen_iff_eq_or_transGen.mp (reflTransGen_of_succ r h1 h2)).resolve_left hnm.symm

/-- `(n, m)` is in the transitive closure of a reflexive relation `~` if `i ~ succ i` and
  `succ i ~ i` for all `i` between `n` and `m`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Relation/Variant8a9e088e5454a13ed87e6d168c7f075a143ebeeb5b2c0d7cdbe51b72c85f3a7c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Relation/Variant8a9e088e5454a13ed87e6d168c7f075a143ebeeb5b2c0d7cdbe51b72c85f3a7c.lean#L77).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d0501a89d73058c3f9c9a17f71c7ea00b890da85` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
