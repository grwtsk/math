## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f4ab5e63af00d16f86b422c4f30d64ecd3c9d62b1f7192d2a6a4689352c4f8e5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 296–307.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : CompleteLattice (Concept α β r) :=
  { Concept.instLatticeConcept,
    Concept.instBoundedOrderConcept with
    sup := Concept.instSupConcept.sup
    le_sSup := fun _ _ hc => snd_subset_snd_iff.1 <| biInter_subset_of_mem hc
    sSup_le := fun _ _ hc =>
      snd_subset_snd_iff.1 <| subset_iInter₂ fun d hd => snd_subset_snd_iff.2 <| hc d hd
    inf := Concept.instInfConcept.inf
    sInf_le := fun _ _ => biInter_subset_of_mem
    le_sInf := fun _ _ => subset_iInter₂ }

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Concept/Variantefdebe620efeddcf2bbb419a06f443f3ec83ce7798760791fd6b2368f1529256.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Concept/Variantefdebe620efeddcf2bbb419a06f443f3ec83ce7798760791fd6b2368f1529256.lean#L296).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `82e7f1edea5cf96c119687aa1a6ac602a62791b2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
