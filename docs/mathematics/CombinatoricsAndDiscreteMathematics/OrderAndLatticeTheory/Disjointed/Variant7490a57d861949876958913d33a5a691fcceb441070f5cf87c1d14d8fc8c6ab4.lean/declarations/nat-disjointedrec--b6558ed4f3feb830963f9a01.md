## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:af0926fdc10c44a48a6d980f000c93cbd3292789c86a336f29e2c80a7dcb181e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 51–61.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Nat.disjointedRec {f : ℕ → α} {p : α → Sort*} (hdiff : ∀ ⦃t i⦄, p t → p (t \ f i)) :
    ∀ ⦃n⦄, p (f n) → p (disjointed f n)
  | 0 => fun h₀ ↦ disjointed_zero f ▸ h₀
  | n + 1 => fun h => by
    suffices H : ∀ k, p (f (n + 1) \ partialSups f k) from disjointed_add_one f n ▸ H n
    intro k
    induction k with
    | zero => exact hdiff h
    | succ k ih => simpa only [partialSups_add_one, ← sdiff_sdiff_left] using hdiff ih

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Disjointed/Variant7490a57d861949876958913d33a5a691fcceb441070f5cf87c1d14d8fc8c6ab4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Disjointed/Variant7490a57d861949876958913d33a5a691fcceb441070f5cf87c1d14d8fc8c6ab4.lean#L51).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4d65197cb1c8a1a710dd94d72decc4029f7c876f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
