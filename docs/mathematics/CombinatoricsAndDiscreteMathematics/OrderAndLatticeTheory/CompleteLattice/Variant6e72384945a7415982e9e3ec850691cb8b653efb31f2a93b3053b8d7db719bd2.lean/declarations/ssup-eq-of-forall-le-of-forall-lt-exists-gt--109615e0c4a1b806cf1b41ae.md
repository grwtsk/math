## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:90bc203a-30bc-ba9d-4a25-3d4a008ad25c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 573–583.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sSup_eq_of_forall_le_of_forall_lt_exists_gt (h₁ : ∀ a ∈ s, a ≤ b)
    (h₂ : ∀ w, w < b → ∃ a ∈ s, w < a) : sSup s = b :=
  (sSup_le h₁).eq_of_not_lt fun h =>
    let ⟨_, ha, ha'⟩ := h₂ _ h
    ((le_sSup ha).trans_lt ha').false
#align Sup_eq_of_forall_le_of_forall_lt_exists_gt sSup_eq_of_forall_le_of_forall_lt_exists_gt

/-- Introduction rule to prove that `b` is the infimum of `s`: it suffices to check that `b`
is smaller than all elements of `s`, and that this is not the case of any `w > b`.
See `csInf_eq_of_forall_ge_of_forall_gt_exists_lt` for a version in conditionally complete
lattices. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/CompleteLattice/Variant6e72384945a7415982e9e3ec850691cb8b653efb31f2a93b3053b8d7db719bd2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/CompleteLattice/Variant6e72384945a7415982e9e3ec850691cb8b653efb31f2a93b3053b8d7db719bd2.lean#L573).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `25ded1fcc6911842596498dabc0f4be401b59b25` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
