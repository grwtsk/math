## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d0ae8fd9-f2c5-6857-5878-e05275e5d10a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 98–112.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Directed.extend_bot [Preorder α] [OrderBot α] {e : ι → β} {f : ι → α}
    (hf : Directed (· ≤ ·) f) (he : Function.Injective e) :
    Directed (· ≤ ·) (Function.extend e f ⊥) := by
  intro a b
  rcases (em (∃ i, e i = a)).symm with (ha | ⟨i, rfl⟩)
  · use b
    simp [Function.extend_apply' _ _ _ ha]
  rcases (em (∃ i, e i = b)).symm with (hb | ⟨j, rfl⟩)
  · use e i
    simp [Function.extend_apply' _ _ _ hb]
  rcases hf i j with ⟨k, hi, hj⟩
  use e k
  simp only [he.extend_apply, *, true_and]

/-- A set stable by infimum is `≥`-directed. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Directed/Variant3a0ececbc8c8b659775be0741a7e0203c51be196f59137ade226171295f92c0b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Directed/Variant3a0ececbc8c8b659775be0741a7e0203c51be196f59137ade226171295f92c0b.lean#L98).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `eadc770a498b87fb9594c6133854e62b6607f89f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
