## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b431945deb99d90651a3a9a1ef9d4c151161aa086ec998500a7475a33a686fa1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 566–575.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def orderIsoIicCoe (a : ℝ≥0) : Iic (a : ℝ≥0∞) ≃o Iic a :=
  OrderIso.symm
    { toFun := fun x => ⟨x, coe_le_coe.2 x.2⟩
      invFun := fun x => ⟨ENNReal.toNNReal x, coe_le_coe.1 <| coe_toNNReal_le_self.trans x.2⟩
      left_inv := fun _ => Subtype.ext <| toNNReal_coe _
      right_inv := fun x => Subtype.ext <| coe_toNNReal (ne_top_of_le_ne_top coe_ne_top x.2)
      map_rel_iff' := fun {_ _} => by
        simp only [Equiv.coe_fn_mk, Subtype.mk_le_mk, coe_le_coe, Subtype.coe_le_coe] }

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Inv/Variant55641a8caba4834b9b4307e7c5dcb2cf98baa750ead05b50ef26e90542505b11.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Inv/Variant55641a8caba4834b9b4307e7c5dcb2cf98baa750ead05b50ef26e90542505b11.lean#L566).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8f7363d9d5aec468ef7ddb6ad12ca25179925b16` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
