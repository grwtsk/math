## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:130efac3-5935-35fe-379f-e59ccc9ca1d9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 717–722.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma iSup_lt_eq_self (a : ℝ≥0∞) : ⨆ b, ⨆ _ : b < a, b = a := by
  refine le_antisymm (iSup₂_le fun b hb ↦ hb.le) ?_
  refine le_of_forall_lt fun c hca ↦ ?_
  obtain ⟨d, hcd, hdb⟩ := exists_between hca
  exact hcd.trans_le <| le_iSup₂_of_le d hdb le_rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Inv/Variant55641a8caba4834b9b4307e7c5dcb2cf98baa750ead05b50ef26e90542505b11.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/OrderAndLatticeTheory/Inv/Variant55641a8caba4834b9b4307e7c5dcb2cf98baa750ead05b50ef26e90542505b11.lean#L717).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
