## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:453157e3-fd60-17a3-2c21-3ee17b7a712c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 927–942.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
theorem Ioi_ofDual (a : αᵒᵈ) : Ioi (ofDual a) = (Iio a).map ofDual.toEmbedding :=
  map_refl.symm
#align Ioi_of_dual Ioi_ofDual

end LocallyFiniteOrderTop

section LocallyFiniteOrderTop

variable [LocallyFiniteOrderBot α]

/-- Note we define `Ici (toDual a)` as `Iic a` (which has type `Finset α` not `Finset αᵒᵈ`!)
instead of `(Iic a).map toDual.toEmbedding` as this means the following is defeq:
```
lemma this : (Ici (toDual (toDual a)) : _) = (Ici a : _) := rfl
```

````

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/LocallyFinite/Variantb803708aba6517bc049138efe2c5322ce5f3f5e62036ca2c66a1e34b3b9bf20d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/LocallyFinite/Variantb803708aba6517bc049138efe2c5322ce5f3f5e62036ca2c66a1e34b3b9bf20d.lean#L927).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `85cee2cb0851fc43a44df6e83f34895cf214a5ae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
