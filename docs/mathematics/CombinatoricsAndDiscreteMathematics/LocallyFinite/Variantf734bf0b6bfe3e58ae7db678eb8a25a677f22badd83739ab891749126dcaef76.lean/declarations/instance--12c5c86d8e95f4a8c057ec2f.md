## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:88f1070afc8d6da0ce5f38223c9f11afca9206b5027a40de004e5fcf9a3ff71e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 973–978.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [LocallyFiniteOrderBot α] [LocallyFiniteOrderBot β]
    [DecidableRel ((· ≤ ·) : α × β → α × β → Prop)] : LocallyFiniteOrderBot (α × β) :=
  LocallyFiniteOrderBot.ofIic' (α × β) (fun a => Iic a.fst ×ˢ Iic a.snd) fun a x => by
    rw [mem_product, mem_Iic, mem_Iic]
    rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/LocallyFinite/Variantf734bf0b6bfe3e58ae7db678eb8a25a677f22badd83739ab891749126dcaef76.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/LocallyFinite/Variantf734bf0b6bfe3e58ae7db678eb8a25a677f22badd83739ab891749126dcaef76.lean#L973).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ae1a8ffefd868ee71f35fb7c8bf904344e32aecc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
