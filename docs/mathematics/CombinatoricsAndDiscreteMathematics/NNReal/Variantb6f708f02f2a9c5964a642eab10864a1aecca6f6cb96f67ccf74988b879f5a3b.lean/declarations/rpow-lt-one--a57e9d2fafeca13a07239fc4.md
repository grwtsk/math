## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4d00f0ad-3b38-caa2-cc75-28a7eb7d182d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 900–904.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rpow_lt_one {x : ℝ≥0∞} {z : ℝ} (hx : x < 1) (hz : 0 < z) : x ^ z < 1 := by
  lift x to ℝ≥0 using ne_of_lt (lt_of_lt_of_le hx le_top)
  simp only [coe_lt_one_iff] at hx
  simp [← coe_rpow_of_nonneg _ (le_of_lt hz), NNReal.rpow_lt_one hx hz]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/NNReal/Variantb6f708f02f2a9c5964a642eab10864a1aecca6f6cb96f67ccf74988b879f5a3b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/NNReal/Variantb6f708f02f2a9c5964a642eab10864a1aecca6f6cb96f67ccf74988b879f5a3b.lean#L900).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d6250a8a4d2ad21514990494d6dc41a60d2707ad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
