## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4f78866beb07d4397f6115fd210a177ea609dc7845fb4fdfe3923fdd55577e42`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 280–286.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {A : Type*} [Semiring A] [Algebra ℝ A] : Algebra ℝ≥0 A where
  smul := (· • ·)
  commutes' r x := by simp [Algebra.commutes]
  smul_def' r x := by simp [← Algebra.smul_def (r : ℝ) x, smul_def]
  toRingHom := (algebraMap ℝ A).comp (toRealHom : ℝ≥0 →+* ℝ)

-- verify that the above produces instances we might care about
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/NNReal/Variant4fc3064400e4bc91e6e8cf6a52d9a7907b3845ab9e0bfc7e5117b32cddaddb95.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/NNReal/Variant4fc3064400e4bc91e6e8cf6a52d9a7907b3845ab9e0bfc7e5117b32cddaddb95.lean#L280).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `026e6876cb4998c3563475b5034abdbb2feb38ce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
