## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:aa383df05e46677fe8942d0e5e6ee442dcc2ea4eff138c8d6e68e2ab5095ca22`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–111.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def domainNode (ha : ActiveLayer P C (Ω.profile a.domain)) : Node Ω C where
  type := a.domain
  normal := by
    have hh := T.normal
    rw [a.product] at hh
    exact hh.pi_domain
  sorted := by
    obtain ⟨s, hs⟩ := a.sorted
    exact Ω.domain_sorted hs
  plain := T.plain.predecessor (a.domain_edge hw ha)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Plain/Variantbb1b49cc75dffec63080fbcd9ef16e836aed13b1c5c95167d9d214eed6653692.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/CombinatoricsAndDiscreteMathematics/Plain/Variantbb1b49cc75dffec63080fbcd9ef16e836aed13b1c5c95167d9d214eed6653692.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6a06da1ab34fddd6e41657079438d1eaa5b37095` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
