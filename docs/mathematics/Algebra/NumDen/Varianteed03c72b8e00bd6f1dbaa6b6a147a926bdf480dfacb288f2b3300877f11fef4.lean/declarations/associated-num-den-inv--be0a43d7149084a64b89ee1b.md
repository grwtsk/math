## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:813c8006-70f9-94ea-6517-ca336da3f93b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–152.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma associated_num_den_inv (x : K) (hx : x ≠ 0) : Associated (num A x : A) (den A x⁻¹) := by
  have : Associated (num A x⁻¹⁻¹ : A) (den A x⁻¹) :=
    (associated_den_num_inv x⁻¹ (inv_ne_zero hx)).symm
  rw [inv_inv] at this
  exact this

end NumDen

end IsFractionRing
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/NumDen/Varianteed03c72b8e00bd6f1dbaa6b6a147a926bdf480dfacb288f2b3300877f11fef4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/NumDen/Varianteed03c72b8e00bd6f1dbaa6b6a147a926bdf480dfacb288f2b3300877f11fef4.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2855423c992416687f62d610390f6b8c1a7fdb90` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
