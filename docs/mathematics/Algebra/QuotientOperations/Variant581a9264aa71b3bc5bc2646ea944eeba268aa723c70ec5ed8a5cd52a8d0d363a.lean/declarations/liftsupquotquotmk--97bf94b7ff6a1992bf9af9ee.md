## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:65e74170017a01b8cfcae7c4a3ea98a52234c6cc3fb00b41801d9549bca67164`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 721–725.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def liftSupQuotQuotMkₐ (I J : Ideal A) : A ⧸ I ⊔ J →ₐ[R] (A ⧸ I) ⧸ J.map (Quotient.mkₐ R I) :=
  AlgHom.mk (liftSupQuotQuotMk I J) fun _ => rfl
#align double_quot.lift_sup_quot_quot_mkₐ DoubleQuot.liftSupQuotQuotMkₐ

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/QuotientOperations/Variant581a9264aa71b3bc5bc2646ea944eeba268aa723c70ec5ed8a5cd52a8d0d363a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/QuotientOperations/Variant581a9264aa71b3bc5bc2646ea944eeba268aa723c70ec5ed8a5cd52a8d0d363a.lean#L721).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e37043b08ba29f8c19d8a890d3e3667ce700414a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
