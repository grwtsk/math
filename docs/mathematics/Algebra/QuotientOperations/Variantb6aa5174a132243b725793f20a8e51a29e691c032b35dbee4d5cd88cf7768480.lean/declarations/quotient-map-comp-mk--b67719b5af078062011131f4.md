## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7c03a6e7-c04b-e241-2003-fd066ec3a1c0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 449–455.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem quotient_map_comp_mkₐ {I : Ideal A} (J : Ideal B) (f : A →ₐ[R₁] B) (H : I ≤ J.comap f) :
    (quotientMapₐ J f H).comp (Quotient.mkₐ R₁ I) = (Quotient.mkₐ R₁ J).comp f :=
  AlgHom.ext fun x => by simp only [quotient_map_mkₐ, Quotient.mkₐ_eq_mk, AlgHom.comp_apply]
#align ideal.quotient_map_comp_mkₐ Ideal.quotient_map_comp_mkₐ

/-- The algebra equiv `A/I ≃ₐ[R] B/J` induced by an algebra equiv `f : A ≃ₐ[R] B`,
where`J = f(I)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/QuotientOperations/Variantb6aa5174a132243b725793f20a8e51a29e691c032b35dbee4d5cd88cf7768480.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/QuotientOperations/Variantb6aa5174a132243b725793f20a8e51a29e691c032b35dbee4d5cd88cf7768480.lean#L449).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `84945924f5849d250bdbf17853c91aa507775d7c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
