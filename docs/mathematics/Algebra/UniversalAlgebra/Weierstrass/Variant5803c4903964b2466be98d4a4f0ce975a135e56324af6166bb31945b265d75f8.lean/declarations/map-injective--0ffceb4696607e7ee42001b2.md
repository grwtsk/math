## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1afbf059-2dbc-3d29-52b4-20fdc8602375`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 292–305.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    Function.Injective <| map (f := f) := fun _ _ h => by
  rcases mk.inj h with ⟨_, _, _, _, _⟩
  ext <;> apply_fun _ using hf <;> assumption

section TorsionPolynomial

/-! ### 2-torsion polynomials -/

/-- A cubic polynomial whose discriminant is a multiple of the Weierstrass curve discriminant. If
`W` is an elliptic curve over a field `R` of characteristic different from 2, then its roots over a
splitting field of `R` are precisely the `X`-coordinates of the non-zero 2-torsion points of `W`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Weierstrass/Variant5803c4903964b2466be98d4a4f0ce975a135e56324af6166bb31945b265d75f8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Weierstrass/Variant5803c4903964b2466be98d4a4f0ce975a135e56324af6166bb31945b265d75f8.lean#L292).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ab438dd76eac171aa857dbc2f7beac306cd40eaa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
