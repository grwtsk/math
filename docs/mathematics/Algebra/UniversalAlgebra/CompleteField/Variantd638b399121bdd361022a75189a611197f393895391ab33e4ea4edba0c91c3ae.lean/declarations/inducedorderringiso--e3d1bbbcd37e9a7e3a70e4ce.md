## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:915f8f800fb5c9b250c570947fe3619318593790081ea0c27bd0f56d523c7a32`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 277–290.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def inducedOrderRingIso : β ≃+*o γ :=
  { inducedOrderRingHom β γ with
    invFun := inducedMap γ β
    left_inv := inducedMap_inv_self _ _
    right_inv := inducedMap_inv_self _ _
    map_le_map_iff' := by
      dsimp
      refine ⟨fun h => ?_, fun h => inducedMap_mono _ _ h⟩
      convert! inducedMap_mono γ β h <;>
      · rw [inducedOrderRingHom, AddMonoidHom.coe_fn_mkRingHomOfMulSelfOfTwoNeZero, inducedAddHom]
        dsimp
        rw [inducedMap_inv_self β γ _] }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/CompleteField/Variantd638b399121bdd361022a75189a611197f393895391ab33e4ea4edba0c91c3ae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/CompleteField/Variantd638b399121bdd361022a75189a611197f393895391ab33e4ea4edba0c91c3ae.lean#L277).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77c95c9035a7f67c707a0138c86d3784484534bd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
