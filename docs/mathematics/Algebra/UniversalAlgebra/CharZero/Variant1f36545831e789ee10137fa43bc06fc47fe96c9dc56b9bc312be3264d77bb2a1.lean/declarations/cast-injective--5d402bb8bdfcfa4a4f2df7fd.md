## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a2ff4f01-c1d9-3842-52ab-7030441c0a8b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 29–39.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma cast_injective : Injective ((↑) : ℚ → α)
  | ⟨n₁, d₁, d₁0, c₁⟩, ⟨n₂, d₂, d₂0, c₂⟩, h => by
    have d₁a : (d₁ : α) ≠ 0 := Nat.cast_ne_zero.2 d₁0
    have d₂a : (d₂ : α) ≠ 0 := Nat.cast_ne_zero.2 d₂0
    rw [mk'_eq_divInt, mk'_eq_divInt] at h ⊢
    rw [cast_divInt_of_ne_zero, cast_divInt_of_ne_zero] at h <;> simp [d₁0, d₂0] at h ⊢
    rwa [eq_div_iff_mul_eq d₂a, division_def, mul_assoc, (d₁.cast_commute (d₂ : α)).inv_left₀.eq, ←
      mul_assoc, ← division_def, eq_comm, eq_div_iff_mul_eq d₁a, eq_comm, ← Int.cast_natCast d₁, ←
      Int.cast_mul, ← Int.cast_natCast d₂, ← Int.cast_mul, Int.cast_inj, ← mkRat_eq_iff d₁0 d₂0]
      at h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/CharZero/Variant1f36545831e789ee10137fa43bc06fc47fe96c9dc56b9bc312be3264d77bb2a1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/CharZero/Variant1f36545831e789ee10137fa43bc06fc47fe96c9dc56b9bc312be3264d77bb2a1.lean#L29).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `df932d3b65eadc366e20bb0df602a5f7343f607e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
