## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:21ea2b69-dd03-550f-a516-b0170b587f7e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 114–121.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coe_greatestOfBdd_eq {P : ℤ → Prop} [DecidablePred P] {b b' : ℤ}
    (Hb : ∀ z : ℤ, P z → z ≤ b) (Hb' : ∀ z : ℤ, P z → z ≤ b') (Hinh : ∃ z : ℤ, P z) :
    (greatestOfBdd b Hb Hinh : ℤ) = greatestOfBdd b' Hb' Hinh := by
  rcases greatestOfBdd b Hb Hinh with ⟨n, hn, h2n⟩
  rcases greatestOfBdd b' Hb' Hinh with ⟨n', hn', h2n'⟩
  exact le_antisymm (h2n' _ hn) (h2n _ hn')

end Int
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/LeastGreatest/Variant920a4797294fa1d500f8f7f2bff4194c3ae120ada0a8c2fd039da7205cb38bbb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/LeastGreatest/Variant920a4797294fa1d500f8f7f2bff4194c3ae120ada0a8c2fd039da7205cb38bbb.lean#L114).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5c3e42e3fb5ae3dfd06e7d8c22ea2485016bd7ce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
