## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c669f512-0e70-628b-354f-b8882c205034`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 177–184.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma ShortExact.ab_finite_iff {S : ShortComplex Ab.{u}} (hS : S.ShortExact) :
    Finite S.X₂ ↔ Finite S.X₁ ∧ Finite S.X₃ where
  mp _ := ⟨.of_injective _ hS.ab_injective_f, .of_surjective _ hS.ab_surjective_g⟩
  mpr | ⟨_, _⟩ => hS.exact.ab_finite

end ShortComplex

end CategoryTheory
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Ab/Variant9e6146779f430bd6109ab23d0571454a414b155ce3d1dc090dc17d5c7f45994f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Ab/Variant9e6146779f430bd6109ab23d0571454a414b155ce3d1dc090dc17d5c7f45994f.lean#L177).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a1aa5b29d99c64f1bc770feba804c2b3662fb250` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
