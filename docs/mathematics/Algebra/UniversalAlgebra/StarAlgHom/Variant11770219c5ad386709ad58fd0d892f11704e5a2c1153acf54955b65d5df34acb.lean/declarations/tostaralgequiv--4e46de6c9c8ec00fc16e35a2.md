## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4f17d921d73186e2dade91462c24a11dd0c40b547444ed73ab062d0463cedebb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 688–696.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toStarAlgEquiv {F R A B : Type*} [Add A] [Mul A] [SMul R A] [Star A] [Add B] [Mul B] [SMul R B]
    [Star B] [EquivLike F A B] [NonUnitalAlgEquivClass F R A B] [StarHomClass F A B]
    (f : F) : A ≃⋆ₐ[R] B :=
  { (f : A ≃+* B) with
    map_star' := map_star f
    map_smul' := map_smul f}

/-- Any type satisfying `AlgEquivClass` and `StarHomClass` can be cast into `StarAlgEquiv` via
`StarAlgEquivClass.toStarAlgEquiv`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/StarAlgHom/Variant11770219c5ad386709ad58fd0d892f11704e5a2c1153acf54955b65d5df34acb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/StarAlgHom/Variant11770219c5ad386709ad58fd0d892f11704e5a2c1153acf54955b65d5df34acb.lean#L688).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c155d9a8f5b05839cd7ea6357ec1dd68fbc97c3d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
