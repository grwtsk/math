## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a50e930f20b08ba19fd250682f689d95a8cc24213d4fab144f5e859c6de12bc2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 618–628.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def prodEquiv : (A →⋆ₐ[R] B) × (A →⋆ₐ[R] C) ≃ (A →⋆ₐ[R] B × C) where
  toFun f := f.1.prod f.2
  invFun f := ((fst _ _ _).comp f, (snd _ _ _).comp f)

end StarAlgHom

/-! ### Star algebra equivalences -/

/-- A *⋆-algebra* equivalence is an equivalence preserving addition, multiplication, scalar
multiplication and the star operation, which allows for considering both unital and non-unital
equivalences with a single structure. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/StarAlgHom/Variant2dee361fb2a40e1fec9b0a7b2a079f9f4b2c57caab0c6b437d243e98b97395ef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/StarAlgHom/Variant2dee361fb2a40e1fec9b0a7b2a079f9f4b2c57caab0c6b437d243e98b97395ef.lean#L618).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4203d61448d030b91a70fa32dd8657854da11f01` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
