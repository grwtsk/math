## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4a72321d5fc588d36a13d236dbe4eca74db145ec3cac3561aa02cf977b16650e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 67–77.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isOrderedCancelMonoid [CommMonoid α] [PartialOrder α] [IsOrderedCancelMonoid α]
    [CommMonoid β] [PartialOrder β] [IsOrderedCancelMonoid β] :
    IsOrderedCancelMonoid (α ×ₗ β) where
  mul_le_mul_left _ _ := mul_le_mul_left'
  le_of_mul_le_mul_left _ _ _ hxyz := (le_iff.1 hxyz).elim
    (fun hxy => left _ _ <| lt_of_mul_lt_mul_left' hxy)
    (fun hxy => le_iff.2 <| Or.inr ⟨mul_left_cancel hxy.1, le_of_mul_le_mul_left' hxy.2⟩)

end Lex

end Prod
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Prod/Variant19da03e300ebceebffef8b59ba0395eb668b8a82983f69837586c379f6abe6df.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Prod/Variant19da03e300ebceebffef8b59ba0395eb668b8a82983f69837586c379f6abe6df.lean#L67).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a4903e6815fe87a4de8411594e401031a5d101f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
