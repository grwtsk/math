## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fbb86e107a63f17601a9bebbaef549a309d513d0385c5af98bb93539aa520ec9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 34–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance existsMulOfLe {ι : Type*} {α : ι → Type*} [∀ i, LE (α i)] [∀ i, Mul (α i)]
    [∀ i, ExistsMulOfLE (α i)] : ExistsMulOfLE (∀ i, α i) :=
  ⟨fun h =>
    ⟨fun i => (exists_mul_of_le <| h i).choose,
      funext fun i => (exists_mul_of_le <| h i).choose_spec⟩⟩

/-- The product of a family of canonically ordered monoids is a canonically ordered monoid. -/
@[to_additive
      "The product of a family of canonically ordered additive monoids is
a canonically ordered additive monoid."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Pi/Variantd51c693b7180c36f54349b7f81561dd785d4ee08238c831e57dba894d6219adc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Pi/Variantd51c693b7180c36f54349b7f81561dd785d4ee08238c831e57dba894d6219adc.lean#L34).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b9bf21ef8e856b21033a9338693fea2830bb1e7f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
