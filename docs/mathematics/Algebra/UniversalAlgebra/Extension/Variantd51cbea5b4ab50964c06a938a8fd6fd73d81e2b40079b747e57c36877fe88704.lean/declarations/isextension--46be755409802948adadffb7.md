## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e32379bfba3f46e56c0debd7111dd4687c84f40fbbc4b3148096c4c9d8698ec9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 45–52.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class IsExtension (i : N →ₗ⁅R⁆ L) (p : L →ₗ⁅R⁆ M) : Prop where
  ker_eq_bot : i.ker = ⊥
  range_eq_top : p.range = ⊤
  exact : i.range = p.ker

variable (R N M) in
/-- The type of all Lie extensions of `M` by `N`.  That is, short exact sequences of `R`-Lie algebra
homomorphisms `0 → N → L → M → 0` where `R`, `M`, and `N` are fixed. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Extension/Variantd51cbea5b4ab50964c06a938a8fd6fd73d81e2b40079b747e57c36877fe88704.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Extension/Variantd51cbea5b4ab50964c06a938a8fd6fd73d81e2b40079b747e57c36877fe88704.lean#L45).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0b177a0bbe4e4a4507d760190c1d7aa42ad2ae4d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
