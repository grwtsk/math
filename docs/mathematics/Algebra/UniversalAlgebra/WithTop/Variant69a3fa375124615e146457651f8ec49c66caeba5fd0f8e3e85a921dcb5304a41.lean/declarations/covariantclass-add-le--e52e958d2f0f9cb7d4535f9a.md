## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a63eb78623f0d55c7b9124014405416e9a9bbbe7af18c5f07d1f8754f8cb386b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 204–211.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance covariantClass_add_le [LE α] [CovariantClass α α (· + ·) (· ≤ ·)] :
    CovariantClass (WithTop α) (WithTop α) (· + ·) (· ≤ ·) :=
  ⟨fun a b c h => by
    cases a <;> cases c <;> try exact le_top
    rcases le_coe_iff.1 h with ⟨b, rfl, _⟩
    exact coe_le_coe.2 (add_le_add_left (coe_le_coe.1 h) _)⟩
#align with_top.covariant_class_add_le WithTop.covariantClass_add_le

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/WithTop/Variant69a3fa375124615e146457651f8ec49c66caeba5fd0f8e3e85a921dcb5304a41.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/WithTop/Variant69a3fa375124615e146457651f8ec49c66caeba5fd0f8e3e85a921dcb5304a41.lean#L204).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `71756a80ab7c38d4197016c0544719ab47422bda` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
