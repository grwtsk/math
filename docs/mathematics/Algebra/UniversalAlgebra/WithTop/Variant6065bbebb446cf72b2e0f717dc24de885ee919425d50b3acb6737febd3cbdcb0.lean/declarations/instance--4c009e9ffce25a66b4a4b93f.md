## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4197871f7159bc60bfa31023caded968d014eb0ce5f161f2d1c01b7c9a65a565`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 338–350.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [MulZeroClass α] [Preorder α] [PosMulStrictMono α] : PosMulStrictMono (WithBot α) :=
  ⟨by
    intro ⟨x, x0⟩ a b h
    simp only [Subtype.coe_mk]
    lift x to α using x0.ne_bot
    induction b using WithBot.recBotCoe
    · exact absurd h not_lt_bot
    induction a using WithBot.recBotCoe
    · simp_rw [mul_bot x0.ne.symm, ← coe_mul, bot_lt_coe]
    simp only [← coe_mul, coe_lt_coe] at *
    norm_cast at x0
    exact mul_lt_mul_of_pos_left h x0 ⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/WithTop/Variant6065bbebb446cf72b2e0f717dc24de885ee919425d50b3acb6737febd3cbdcb0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/WithTop/Variant6065bbebb446cf72b2e0f717dc24de885ee919425d50b3acb6737febd3cbdcb0.lean#L338).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bd1c9b0b3ac42b9b20a837d6e7397998ec386bf9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
