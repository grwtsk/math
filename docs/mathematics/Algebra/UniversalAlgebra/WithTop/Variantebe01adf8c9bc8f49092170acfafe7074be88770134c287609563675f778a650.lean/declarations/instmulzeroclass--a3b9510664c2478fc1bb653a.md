## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9e0c3e6fcad16f2c376e3d6906a21384402f98051ef0d1ada4dc398ea734ff2f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 25–38.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instMulZeroClass : MulZeroClass (WithTop α) where
  zero := 0
  mul
    | (a : α), (b : α) => ↑(a * b)
    | (a : α), ⊤ => if a = 0 then 0 else ⊤
    | ⊤, (b : α) => if b = 0 then 0 else ⊤
    | ⊤, ⊤ => ⊤
  mul_zero
    | (a : α) => congr_arg some <| mul_zero _
    | ⊤ => if_pos rfl
  zero_mul
    | (b : α) => congr_arg some <| zero_mul _
    | ⊤ => if_pos rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/WithTop/Variantebe01adf8c9bc8f49092170acfafe7074be88770134c287609563675f778a650.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/WithTop/Variantebe01adf8c9bc8f49092170acfafe7074be88770134c287609563675f778a650.lean#L25).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ed3afc1d1509810b20e7cd587748561850c79d12` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
