## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:86f64484-5c1d-aeea-bce5-b12354178f38`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 61–70.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem MulEquiv.prime_iff {E : Type*} [EquivLike E M N] [MulEquivClass E M N] (e : E) :
    Prime (e p) ↔ Prime p := by
  let e := MulEquivClass.toMulEquiv e
  exact ⟨comap_prime e e.symm fun a => by simp,
    fun h => (comap_prime e.symm e fun a => by simp) <| (e.symm_apply_apply p).substr h⟩

end Map

end Prime

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Lemmas/Variant852e6d9ec2e84938e7de5666612bcbd1a41a5f93f8946ffbd0097e6cf4f6557c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Lemmas/Variant852e6d9ec2e84938e7de5666612bcbd1a41a5f93f8946ffbd0097e6cf4f6557c.lean#L61).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
