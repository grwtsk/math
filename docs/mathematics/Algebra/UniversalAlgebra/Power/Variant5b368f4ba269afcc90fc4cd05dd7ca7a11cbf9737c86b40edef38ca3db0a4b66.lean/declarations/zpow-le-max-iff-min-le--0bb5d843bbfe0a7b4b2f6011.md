## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b09f6aaa-cce5-abf7-bee6-100b1f76fe59`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 117–133.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem zpow_le_max_iff_min_le {x : α} (hx : 1 < x) {a b c : ℤ} :
    x ^ (-c) ≤ max (x ^ (-a)) (x ^ (-b)) ↔ min a b ≤ c := by
  simp_rw [le_max_iff, min_le_iff, zpow_le_iff_le hx, neg_le_neg_iff]
#align zpow_le_max_iff_min_le zpow_le_max_iff_min_le

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Power/Variant5b368f4ba269afcc90fc4cd05dd7ca7a11cbf9737c86b40edef38ca3db0a4b66.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Power/Variant5b368f4ba269afcc90fc4cd05dd7ca7a11cbf9737c86b40edef38ca3db0a4b66.lean#L117).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d2e81737c6cc3c0ed54e6d15d6f1a9ea617cf605` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
