## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ad1f7bee-71c2-9d87-1a30-dba98dcf6f1a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 99–105.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem commute_eps_right [Semiring R] (x : DualNumber R) : Commute x ε := (commute_eps_left x).symm

variable {A : Type*} [CommSemiring R] [Semiring A] [Semiring B] [Algebra R A] [Algebra R B]

/-- For two `R`-algebra morphisms out of `A[ε]` to agree, it suffices for them to agree on the
elements of `A` and the `A`-multiples of `ε`. -/
@[ext 1100]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/DualNumber/Variant36879f2e7c77c5b6b881bb123422294914c2863e36fe5b70c12ab1a11eeae17d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/DualNumber/Variant36879f2e7c77c5b6b881bb123422294914c2863e36fe5b70c12ab1a11eeae17d.lean#L99).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b36a2be106fff3fa61157d2e93c06948b0ac5309` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
