## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2d2ff5f20b99c4ab49b5cc7cf762269256efd90403c6c63f949e350bff5d8c61`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 25–32.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) toZeroHomClass [MulZeroClass α] [MulZeroClass β] [MulEquivClass F α β] :
    ZeroHomClass F α β where
  map_zero f :=
    calc
      f 0 = f 0 * f (EquivLike.inv f 0) := by rw [← map_mul, zero_mul]
        _ = 0 := by simp

-- See note [lower instance priority]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Equiv/Variante6b358891ab196dbb7158c54e7b13e43197875901b44177019cb90ff9c9c9342.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Equiv/Variante6b358891ab196dbb7158c54e7b13e43197875901b44177019cb90ff9c9c9342.lean#L25).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1fae1f45d8bc6d117e5b901efcea442a976b01f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
