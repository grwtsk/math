## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8609f565-621d-c43d-0251-b4ff275b1fbf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 240–272.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Continued Fractions of Rationals Terminate

Finally, we show that the continued fraction of a rational number terminates.

The crucial insight is that, given any `q : ℚ` with `0 < q < 1`, the numerator of `Int.fract q` is
smaller than the numerator of `q`. As the continued fraction computation recursively operates on
the fractional part of a value `v` and `0 ≤ Int.fract v < 1`, we infer that the numerator of the
fractional part in the computation decreases by at least one in each step. As `0 ≤ Int.fract v`,
this process must stop after finite number of steps, and the computation hence terminates.

/-- Shows that for any `q : ℚ` with `0 < q < 1`, the numerator of the fractional part of
`int_fract_pair.of q⁻¹` is smaller than the numerator of `q`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/TerminatesIffRat/Variant4c8f10a3154060b1bca5fc2cefa24d2e6704fd039a7a64cdbd986c0ee855c2ff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/TerminatesIffRat/Variant4c8f10a3154060b1bca5fc2cefa24d2e6704fd039a7a64cdbd986c0ee855c2ff.lean#L240).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8654e9b7dfe01833f290319d3a601d48653d9ec7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
