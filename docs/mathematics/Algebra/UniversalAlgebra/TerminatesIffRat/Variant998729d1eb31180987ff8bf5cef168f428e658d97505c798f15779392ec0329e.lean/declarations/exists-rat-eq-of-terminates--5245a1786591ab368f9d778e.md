## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3cf25f03-cd3b-7e25-9b60-149b867e0ac6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 129–164.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Technical Translation Lemmas

Before we can show that the continued fraction of a rational number terminates, we have to prove
some technical translation lemmas. More precisely, in this section, we show that, given a rational
number `q : ℚ` and value `v : K` with `v = ↑q`, the continued fraction of `q` and `v` coincide.
In particular, we show that
```lean
    (↑(GenContFract.of q : GenContFract ℚ) : GenContFract K) = GenContFract.of v`
```
in `GenContFract.coe_of_rat_eq`.

To do this, we proceed bottom-up, showing the correspondence between the basic functions involved in
the Computation first and then lift the results step-by-step.

-- The lifting works for arbitrary linear ordered fields with a floor function.

/-! First, we show the correspondence for the very basic functions in
`GenContFract.IntFractPair`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/TerminatesIffRat/Variant998729d1eb31180987ff8bf5cef168f428e658d97505c798f15779392ec0329e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/TerminatesIffRat/Variant998729d1eb31180987ff8bf5cef168f428e658d97505c798f15779392ec0329e.lean#L129).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27f5cbb5311c7f47c0f7ffce8c5458d3ad1fee57` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
