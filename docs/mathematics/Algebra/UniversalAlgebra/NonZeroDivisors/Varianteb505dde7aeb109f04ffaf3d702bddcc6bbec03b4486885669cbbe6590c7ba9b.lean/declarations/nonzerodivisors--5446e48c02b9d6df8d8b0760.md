## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:62c9d70686b0e512bbeeb8cfe118eb864d74102683c20c504cc509f122d98ee4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 95–108.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def nonZeroDivisors (M₀ : Type*) [MonoidWithZero M₀] : Submonoid M₀ where
  carrier := { x | ∀ z, z * x = 0 → z = 0 }
  one_mem' _ hz := by rwa [mul_one] at hz
  mul_mem' hx₁ hx₂ _ hz := by
    rw [← mul_assoc] at hz
    exact hx₁ _ (hx₂ _ hz)

/-- The notation for the submonoid of non-zero divisors. -/
scoped[nonZeroDivisors] notation:9000 M₀ "⁰" => nonZeroDivisors M₀

/-- Let `M₀` be a monoid with zero and `M` an additive monoid with an `M₀`-action, then the
collection of non-zero smul-divisors forms a submonoid.

These elements are also called `M`-regular. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/NonZeroDivisors/Varianteb505dde7aeb109f04ffaf3d702bddcc6bbec03b4486885669cbbe6590c7ba9b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/NonZeroDivisors/Varianteb505dde7aeb109f04ffaf3d702bddcc6bbec03b4486885669cbbe6590c7ba9b.lean#L95).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb917e7a9e04e44aaba72a59be01084e99420df7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
