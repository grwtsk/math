## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:92230c4fb12b65ad6825bd2a12e3b2cd52e53c4c632fcec1249dfe59c9c2f616`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 28–38.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def inferOrderedSemiring (α : Q(Type u)) : MetaM <|
    (_ : Q(Semiring $α)) × (_ : Q(PartialOrder $α)) × Q(IsOrderedRing $α) :=
  let go := do
    let semiring ← synthInstanceQ q(Semiring $α)
    let partialOrder ← synthInstanceQ q(PartialOrder $α)
    let isOrderedRing ← synthInstanceQ q(IsOrderedRing $α)
    return ⟨semiring, partialOrder, isOrderedRing⟩
  go <|> throwError "not an ordered semiring"

/-- Helper function to synthesize typed `Ring α` `PartialOrder α` `IsOrderedRing α`
expressions. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Ineq/Variante8d5d6cf79f13745cac02e1aa012d0ae912a4eb6da664f385240059c6fb33b2d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Ineq/Variante8d5d6cf79f13745cac02e1aa012d0ae912a4eb6da664f385240059c6fb33b2d.lean#L28).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `64dfaf471d8c1178946c92984ad08874e6398a4e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
