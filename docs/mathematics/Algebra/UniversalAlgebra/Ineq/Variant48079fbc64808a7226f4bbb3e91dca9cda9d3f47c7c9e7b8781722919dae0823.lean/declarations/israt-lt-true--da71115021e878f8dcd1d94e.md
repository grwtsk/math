## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bcd398d2-4dfe-136a-97a2-337c8a13d1b2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 137–148.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isRat_lt_true [Ring α] [LinearOrder α] [IsStrictOrderedRing α] :
    {a b : α} → {na nb : ℤ} → {da db : ℕ} →
    IsRat a na da → IsRat b nb db → decide (na * db < nb * da) → a < b
  | _, _, _, _, da, db, ⟨_, rfl⟩, ⟨_, rfl⟩, h => by
    have h := Int.cast_strictMono (R := α) <| of_decide_eq_true h
    have ha : 0 < ⅟(da : α) := pos_invOf_of_invertible_cast da
    have hb : 0 < ⅟(db : α) := pos_invOf_of_invertible_cast db
    have h := (mul_lt_mul_of_pos_left · hb) <| mul_lt_mul_of_pos_right h ha
    rw [← mul_assoc, Int.commute_cast] at h
    simp? at h says simp only [Int.cast_mul, Int.cast_natCast, mul_invOf_cancel_right'] at h
    rwa [Int.commute_cast] at h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Ineq/Variant48079fbc64808a7226f4bbb3e91dca9cda9d3f47c7c9e7b8781722919dae0823.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Ineq/Variant48079fbc64808a7226f4bbb3e91dca9cda9d3f47c7c9e7b8781722919dae0823.lean#L137).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d7156ab2d7a45aa8fbeef3594a27a9500abc982e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
