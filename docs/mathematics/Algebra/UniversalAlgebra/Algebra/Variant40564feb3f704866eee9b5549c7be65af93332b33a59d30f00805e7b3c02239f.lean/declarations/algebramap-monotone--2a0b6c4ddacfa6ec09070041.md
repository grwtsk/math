## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8abb63b5-970a-0bac-4184-e8d43104e24e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 44–50.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem algebraMap_monotone : Monotone (algebraMap R A) := fun a b h => by
  rw [Algebra.algebraMap_eq_smul_one, Algebra.algebraMap_eq_smul_one, ← sub_nonneg, ← sub_smul]
  trans (b - a) • (0 : A)
  · simp
  · exact smul_le_smul_of_nonneg_left zero_le_one (sub_nonneg.mpr h)

end OrderedAlgebra
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Algebra/Variant40564feb3f704866eee9b5549c7be65af93332b33a59d30f00805e7b3c02239f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Algebra/Variant40564feb3f704866eee9b5549c7be65af93332b33a59d30f00805e7b3c02239f.lean#L44).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `68f3bf8cd531eca2ce7d23bf9e954c068a108405` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
