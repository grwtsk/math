## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `macro` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:804291c4ade2aec21317948692731ac6c5e01c7fda284fc3155c65f9459ef586`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 375–387.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
scoped macro (name := transfer_rw) "transfer_rw" : tactic => `(tactic|
    (repeat first | rw [← to_int_inj] | rw [← lt_to_int] | rw [← le_to_int]
     repeat first | rw [cast_add] | rw [mul_to_int] | rw [cast_one] | rw [cast_zero]))

/--
This tactic tries to prove (in)equalities about `ZNum`s by transferring them to the `Int` world and
then trying to call `simp`.
```lean
example (n : ZNum) (m : ZNum) : n ≤ n + m * m := by

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/ZNum/Variant5697f4be4fceee8fe731130ee79c1b2b10c04aae92b09f5fb3d65f401bc04b7d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/ZNum/Variant5697f4be4fceee8fe731130ee79c1b2b10c04aae92b09f5fb3d65f401bc04b7d.lean#L375).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `df0d1f2d31e8fdc9d954932682693054b726890e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
