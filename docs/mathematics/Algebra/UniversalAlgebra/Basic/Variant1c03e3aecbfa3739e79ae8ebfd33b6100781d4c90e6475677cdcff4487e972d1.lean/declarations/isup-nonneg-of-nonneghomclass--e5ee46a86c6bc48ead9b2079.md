## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:af583cd8-375d-393a-6845-d6ea9d04ca12`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 297–303.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma iSup_nonneg_of_nonnegHomClass {ι F α : Type*} [FunLike F α ℝ] [NonnegHomClass F α ℝ] (f : F)
    (g : ι → α) :
    0 ≤ ⨆ i, f (g i) :=
  iSup_nonneg (fun i ↦ apply_nonneg f (g i))

/-- As `sInf s = 0` when `s` is a set of reals that's either empty or unbounded below,
it suffices to show that all elements of `s` are nonpositive to show that `sInf s ≤ 0`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variant1c03e3aecbfa3739e79ae8ebfd33b6100781d4c90e6475677cdcff4487e972d1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variant1c03e3aecbfa3739e79ae8ebfd33b6100781d4c90e6475677cdcff4487e972d1.lean#L297).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1863a5255808e28c97c8a7f3a19f797a7d3d9d93` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
