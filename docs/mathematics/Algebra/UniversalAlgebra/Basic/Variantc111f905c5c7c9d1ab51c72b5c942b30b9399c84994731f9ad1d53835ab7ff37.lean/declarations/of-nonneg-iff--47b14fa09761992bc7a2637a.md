## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0a1b5a27-1180-8374-b9a3-2fb51504b37c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 103–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma of_nonneg_iff [NonUnitalRing R] [PartialOrder R] [StarRing R]
    (h_add : ∀ {x y : R}, x ≤ y → ∀ z, z + x ≤ z + y)
    (h_nonneg_iff : ∀ x : R, 0 ≤ x ↔ x ∈ AddSubmonoid.closure (Set.range fun s : R => star s * s)) :
    StarOrderedRing R where
  le_iff x y := by
    have : AddLeftMono R := ⟨fun _ _ _ h => h_add h _⟩
    simpa only [← sub_eq_iff_eq_add', sub_nonneg, exists_eq_right'] using h_nonneg_iff (y - x)

/-- When `R` is a non-unital ring, to construct a `StarOrderedRing` instance it suffices to
show that the nonnegative elements are precisely those elements of the form `star s * s`
for `s : R`.

This is provided for convenience because it holds in many common scenarios (e.g.,`ℝ`, `ℂ`, or
any C⋆-algebra), and obviates the hassle of `AddSubmonoid.closure_induction` when creating those
instances. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variantc111f905c5c7c9d1ab51c72b5c942b30b9399c84994731f9ad1d53835ab7ff37.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variantc111f905c5c7c9d1ab51c72b5c942b30b9399c84994731f9ad1d53835ab7ff37.lean#L103).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9e12f5af8a0eddac3a2b81d376735edbd2f197ec` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
