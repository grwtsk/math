## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7d00eb87-8030-c164-b42c-3da472bbf079`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 242–246.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Monotone.mul_const_of_nonpos [ExistsAddOfLE R] [MulPosMono R]
    [AddRightMono R] [AddRightReflectLE R]
    (hf : Monotone f) (ha : a ≤ 0) : Antitone fun x => f x * a :=
  (antitone_mul_right ha).comp_monotone hf

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variant5c538b00ddce0b5105c2031373419f237a6b014c840a1ac7139ab3d8a312051c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variant5c538b00ddce0b5105c2031373419f237a6b014c840a1ac7139ab3d8a312051c.lean#L242).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1208f08492bde25431c84e2c0847228c292f0bb5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
