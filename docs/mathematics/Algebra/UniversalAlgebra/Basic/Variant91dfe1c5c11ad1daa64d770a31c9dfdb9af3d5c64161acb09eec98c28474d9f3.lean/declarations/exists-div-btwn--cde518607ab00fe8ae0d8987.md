## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:acc7c33e-c890-7f4d-e2fd-85b492fc2bc9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 369–379.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_div_btwn {x y : K} {n : ℕ} (h : x < y) (nh : (y - x)⁻¹ < n) :
    ∃ z : ℤ, x < (z : K) / n ∧ (z : K) / n < y := by
  obtain ⟨z, zh⟩ := exists_floor (x * n)
  refine ⟨z + 1, ?_⟩
  have n0' := (inv_pos.2 (sub_pos.2 h)).trans nh
  rw [div_lt_iff₀ n0']
  refine ⟨(lt_div_iff₀ n0').2 <| (lt_iff_lt_of_le_iff_le (zh _)).1 (lt_add_one _), ?_⟩
  rw [Int.cast_add, Int.cast_one]
  grw [(zh _).1 le_rfl]
  rwa [← lt_sub_iff_add_lt', ← sub_mul, ← div_lt_iff₀' (sub_pos.2 h), one_div]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variant91dfe1c5c11ad1daa64d770a31c9dfdb9af3d5c64161acb09eec98c28474d9f3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variant91dfe1c5c11ad1daa64d770a31c9dfdb9af3d5c64161acb09eec98c28474d9f3.lean#L369).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a89d0f191e70fe78dd0a0a0bfbf91443674663d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
