## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ceb4762e-81af-519d-cf68-be6b43ad38d4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 415–423.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_rat_pow_btwn {n : ℕ} (hn : n ≠ 0) {x y : K} (h : x < y) (hy : 0 < y) :
    ∃ q : ℚ, 0 < q ∧ x < (q : K) ^ n ∧ (q : K) ^ n < y := by
  obtain ⟨q₂, hx₂, hy₂⟩ := exists_rat_btwn (max_lt h hy)
  obtain ⟨q₁, hx₁, hq₁₂⟩ := exists_rat_btwn hx₂
  have : (0 : K) < q₂ := (le_max_right _ _).trans_lt hx₂
  norm_cast at hq₁₂ this
  obtain ⟨q, hq, hq₁, hq₂⟩ := exists_pow_btwn hn hq₁₂ this
  refine ⟨q, hq, (le_max_left _ _).trans_lt <| hx₁.trans ?_, hy₂.trans' ?_⟩ <;> assumption_mod_cast

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variant91dfe1c5c11ad1daa64d770a31c9dfdb9af3d5c64161acb09eec98c28474d9f3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variant91dfe1c5c11ad1daa64d770a31c9dfdb9af3d5c64161acb09eec98c28474d9f3.lean#L415).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a89d0f191e70fe78dd0a0a0bfbf91443674663d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
