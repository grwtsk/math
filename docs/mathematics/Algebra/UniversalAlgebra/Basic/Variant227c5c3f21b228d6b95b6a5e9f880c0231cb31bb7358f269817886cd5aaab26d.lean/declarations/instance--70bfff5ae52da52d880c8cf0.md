## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1855801079faa3122ef1015b1272d4aa48ac4b08ddec943d0b298d349ac57f13`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 434–441.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : PosSMulStrictMono R A where
  smul_lt_smul_of_pos_left r hr a b hab := by
    rw [StarOrderedRing.pos_iff] at hr
    rw [StarOrderedRing.lt_iff] at hab ⊢
    obtain ⟨a, ha₀, ha, rfl⟩ := hab
    obtain ⟨hr₀, hr⟩ := hr
    exact ⟨r • a, smul_ne_zero hr₀ ha₀, smul_mem_closure_star_mul hr ha, smul_add ..⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variant227c5c3f21b228d6b95b6a5e9f880c0231cb31bb7358f269817886cd5aaab26d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variant227c5c3f21b228d6b95b6a5e9f880c0231cb31bb7358f269817886cd5aaab26d.lean#L434).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a8d109f8dec75d0bdb7e034b929bff83abe099f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
