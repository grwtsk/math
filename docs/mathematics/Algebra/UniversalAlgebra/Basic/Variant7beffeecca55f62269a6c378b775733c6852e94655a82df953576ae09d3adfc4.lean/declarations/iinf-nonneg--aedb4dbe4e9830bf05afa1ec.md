## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d45dfc0b-5ff6-95ad-dee2-90bcfc939c48`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 270–273.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma iInf_nonneg (hf : ∀ i, 0 ≤ f i) : 0 ≤ iInf f := Real.le_iInf hf le_rfl

/-- As `sSup s = 0` when `s` is a set of reals that's unbounded above, it suffices to show that `s`
contains a nonnegative element to show that `0 ≤ sSup s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variant7beffeecca55f62269a6c378b775733c6852e94655a82df953576ae09d3adfc4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variant7beffeecca55f62269a6c378b775733c6852e94655a82df953576ae09d3adfc4.lean#L270).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6eb068253266f1590b48168d01873d3ea9e9275e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
