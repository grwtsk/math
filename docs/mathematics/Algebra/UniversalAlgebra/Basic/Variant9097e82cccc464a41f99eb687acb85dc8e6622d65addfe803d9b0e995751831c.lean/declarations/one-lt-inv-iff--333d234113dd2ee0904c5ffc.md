## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f36fb2f1-6367-37fa-a07c-6f033f00beba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 900–904.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma one_lt_inv_iff₀ : 1 < a⁻¹ ↔ 0 < a ∧ a < 1 where
  mp h := ⟨inv_pos.1 (zero_lt_one.trans h), inv_inv a ▸ (inv_lt_one₀ <| zero_lt_one.trans h).2 h⟩
  mpr h := (one_lt_inv₀ h.1).2 h.2

@[bound]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variant9097e82cccc464a41f99eb687acb85dc8e6622d65addfe803d9b0e995751831c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variant9097e82cccc464a41f99eb687acb85dc8e6622d65addfe803d9b0e995751831c.lean#L900).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3c2007fac367a070d3ba6ed00354c37b70b02dae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
