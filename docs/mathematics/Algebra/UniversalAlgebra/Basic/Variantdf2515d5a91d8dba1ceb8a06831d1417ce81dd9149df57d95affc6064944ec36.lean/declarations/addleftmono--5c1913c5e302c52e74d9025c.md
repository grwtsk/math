## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:35c20be048e731dba09619d818562b766de36e7faca92ecafdd0e5a9412211ba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 517–525.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance addLeftMono [LinearOrder R] : AddLeftMono (MinTropical R) :=
  ⟨fun x y z h => by
    rcases le_total x y with hx | hy
    · rw [add_eq_left hx, add_eq_left (hx.trans h)]
    · rw [add_eq_right hy]
      rcases le_total x z with hx | hx
      · rwa [add_eq_left hx]
      · rwa [add_eq_right hx]⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variantdf2515d5a91d8dba1ceb8a06831d1417ce81dd9149df57d95affc6064944ec36.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variantdf2515d5a91d8dba1ceb8a06831d1417ce81dd9149df57d95affc6064944ec36.lean#L517).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f3e19c1dd11f85f9f94dfa756aff8427dc26583` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
