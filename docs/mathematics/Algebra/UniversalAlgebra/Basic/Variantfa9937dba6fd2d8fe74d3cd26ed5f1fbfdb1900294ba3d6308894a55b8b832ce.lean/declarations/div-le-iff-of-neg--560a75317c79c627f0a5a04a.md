## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e65cf5d9-732e-946a-8ca5-ebb99bebd8c0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 351–357.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem div_le_iff_of_neg (hc : c < 0) : b / c ≤ a ↔ a * c ≤ b where
  mp h := div_mul_cancel₀ b (ne_of_lt hc) ▸ mul_le_mul_of_nonpos_right h hc.le
  mpr h := calc
    a = a * c * (1 / c) := mul_mul_div a (ne_of_lt hc)
    _ ≥ b * (1 / c) := mul_le_mul_of_nonpos_right h <| inv_eq_one_div c ▸ (inv_lt_zero'.2 hc).le
    _ = b / c := (div_eq_mul_one_div b c).symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variantfa9937dba6fd2d8fe74d3cd26ed5f1fbfdb1900294ba3d6308894a55b8b832ce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Basic/Variantfa9937dba6fd2d8fe74d3cd26ed5f1fbfdb1900294ba3d6308894a55b8b832ce.lean#L351).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c67d7ff404e76764131d627a10a12dbe13520f47` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
