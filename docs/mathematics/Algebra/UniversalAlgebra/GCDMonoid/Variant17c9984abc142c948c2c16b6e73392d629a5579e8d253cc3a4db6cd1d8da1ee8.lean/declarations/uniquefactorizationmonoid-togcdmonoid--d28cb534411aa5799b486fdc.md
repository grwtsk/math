## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d3f9be3b105895f7ac75c0f89ccd472f71ee126b97ec3fddd4dd65062f48a124`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 38–57.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def UniqueFactorizationMonoid.toGCDMonoid (α : Type*) [CommMonoidWithZero α]
    [UniqueFactorizationMonoid α] : GCDMonoid α where
  gcd a b := Quot.out (Associates.mk a ⊓ Associates.mk b : Associates α)
  lcm a b := Quot.out (Associates.mk a ⊔ Associates.mk b : Associates α)
  gcd_dvd_left a b := by
    rw [← mk_dvd_mk, Associates.quot_out, congr_fun₂ dvd_eq_le]
    exact inf_le_left
  gcd_dvd_right a b := by
    rw [← mk_dvd_mk, Associates.quot_out, congr_fun₂ dvd_eq_le]
    exact inf_le_right
  dvd_gcd {a b c} hac hab := by
    rw [← mk_dvd_mk, Associates.quot_out, congr_fun₂ dvd_eq_le, le_inf_iff,
      mk_le_mk_iff_dvd, mk_le_mk_iff_dvd]
    exact ⟨hac, hab⟩
  lcm_zero_left a := by simp
  lcm_zero_right a := by simp
  gcd_mul_lcm a b := by
    rw [← mk_eq_mk_iff_associated, ← Associates.mk_mul_mk, ← associated_iff_eq, Associates.quot_out,
      Associates.quot_out, mul_comm, sup_mul_inf, Associates.mk_mul_mk]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/GCDMonoid/Variant17c9984abc142c948c2c16b6e73392d629a5579e8d253cc3a4db6cd1d8da1ee8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/GCDMonoid/Variant17c9984abc142c948c2c16b6e73392d629a5579e8d253cc3a4db6cd1d8da1ee8.lean#L38).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `46fdb68efc9000e657ee84cb3928e5ee54a673a5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
