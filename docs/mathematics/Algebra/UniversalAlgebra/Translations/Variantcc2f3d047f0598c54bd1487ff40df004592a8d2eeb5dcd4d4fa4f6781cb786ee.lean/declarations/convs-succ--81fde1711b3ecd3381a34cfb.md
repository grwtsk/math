## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f3830275-d3ff-cfc0-8615-972b364a73c9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 329–342.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem convs'_succ :
    (of v).convs' (n + 1) = ⌊v⌋ + 1 / (of (fract v)⁻¹).convs' n := by
  rcases eq_or_ne (fract v) 0 with h | h
  · obtain ⟨a, rfl⟩ : ∃ a : ℤ, v = a := ⟨⌊v⌋, eq_of_sub_eq_zero h⟩
    rw [convs'_of_int, fract_intCast, inv_zero, ← cast_zero, convs'_of_int, cast_zero,
      div_zero, add_zero, floor_intCast]
  · rw [convs', of_h_eq_floor, add_right_inj, convs'Aux_succ_some (of_s_head h)]
    exact congr_arg (1 / ·) (by rw [convs', of_h_eq_floor, add_right_inj, of_s_tail])

end Values

end sequence

end GenContFract
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Translations/Variantcc2f3d047f0598c54bd1487ff40df004592a8d2eeb5dcd4d4fa4f6781cb786ee.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/Translations/Variantcc2f3d047f0598c54bd1487ff40df004592a8d2eeb5dcd4d4fa4f6781cb786ee.lean#L329).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d442fe91ce876b061af88ef7b5e2665884812648` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
