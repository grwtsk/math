## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b998565b2bd0c2bc18f42e063ec9b74e00293f311ce3a392aed6459115f2e09a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 31–41.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {α : Type*} [Mul α] [Preorder α] [MulLeftStrictMono α] :
    PosMulStrictMono (WithZero α) where
  elim := @fun
    | ⟨(x : α), hx⟩, 0, (b : α), _ => by
        simpa only [mul_zero] using WithZero.zero_lt_coe _
    | ⟨(x : α), hx⟩, (a : α), (b : α), h => by
        dsimp only at h ⊢
        norm_cast at h ⊢
        exact mul_lt_mul_left' h x

open Function in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/WithZero/Variante392cac5a76c358b795d5c7ddffeaa626efe0197ee8ad1dbc65e19262002212f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalAlgebra/WithZero/Variante392cac5a76c358b795d5c7ddffeaa626efe0197ee8ad1dbc65e19262002212f.lean#L31).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dc31c487415de20e0f5fed568a15c72e3bacf35e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
