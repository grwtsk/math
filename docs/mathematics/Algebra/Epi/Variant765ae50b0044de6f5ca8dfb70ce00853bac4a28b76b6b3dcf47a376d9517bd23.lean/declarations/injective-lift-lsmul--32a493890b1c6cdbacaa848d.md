## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:84ce7528-81eb-4cef-9b63-92224c9f79ed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 129–160.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

````lean
lemma injective_lift_lsmul :
    Injective (lift <| LinearMap.restrictScalars₁₂ R R (LinearMap.lsmul A M)) := by
  /- Morally the proof is to recognise that we can construct the map `A ⊗[R] M → M` as a
  composition of (`A`-linear) equivalences:
  ```
  A ⊗[R] M ≃  A ⊗[R] (A ⊗[A] M)
           ≃ (A ⊗[R] A) ⊗[A] M
           ≃ A ⊗[A] M
           ≃ M
  ```
  However the second equivalence above requires a version of heterogeneous tensor product
  associativity which is problematic in Mathlib because `TensorProduct.leftModule` prioritises the
  left factor in any tensor product. We therefore formalise a slightly lower level proof below. -/
  suffices ∀ (a : A) (m : M), 1 ⊗ₜ[R] (a • m) = a ⊗ₜ[R] m by
    let f : M →ₗ[R] A ⊗[R] M :=
      { toFun m := 1 ⊗ₜ m
        map_add' m n := tmul_add _ _ _
        map_smul' r m := tmul_smul _ _ _ }
    have aux : f ∘ₗ (lift <| LinearMap.restrictScalars₁₂ R R (LinearMap.lsmul A M)) = .id := by
      ext a m; simpa using! this a m

  let f : A ⊗[R] A →ₗ[R] A ⊗[R] M := lift
    { toFun x :=
      { toFun y := x ⊗ₜ (y • m)
        map_add' := by simp [add_smul, tmul_add]
        map_smul' := by simp }

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Epi/Variant765ae50b0044de6f5ca8dfb70ce00853bac4a28b76b6b3dcf47a376d9517bd23.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Epi/Variant765ae50b0044de6f5ca8dfb70ce00853bac4a28b76b6b3dcf47a376d9517bd23.lean#L129).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1176fe4accf50eee8a5e1f0a6afd72252001fb01` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
