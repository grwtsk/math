## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d2f8902d-d255-0806-837d-e4452fd3d057`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 127–141.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem trunc_derivative' (f : R⟦X⟧) (n : ℕ) :
    trunc (n-1) (d⁄dX R f) = Polynomial.derivative (trunc n f) := by
  cases n with
  | zero =>
    simp
  | succ n =>
    rw [succ_sub_one, trunc_derivative]

end CommutativeSemiring

/- In the next lemma, we use `smul_right_inj`, which requires not only `NoZeroSMulDivisors ℕ R`, but
also cancellation of addition in `R`. For this reason, the next lemma is stated in the case that `R`
is a `CommRing`. -/

/-- If `f` and `g` have the same constant term and derivative, then they are equal. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Derivative/Variant64f7b01a0883dade1797297cfd0262bc28b885e554a337b44658d1bf72b586d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Derivative/Variant64f7b01a0883dade1797297cfd0262bc28b885e554a337b44658d1bf72b586d7.lean#L127).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c1a24bf97583e3d2d7cbffcaf3d881986a1f0368` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
