## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5804e80d-5931-6814-6603-bf8937d6b7ff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 85–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem derivativeFun_mul (f g : R⟦X⟧) :
    derivativeFun (f * g) = f • g.derivativeFun + g • f.derivativeFun := by
  ext n
  have h₁ : n < n + 1 := lt_succ_self n
  have h₂ : n < n + 1 + 1 := Nat.lt_add_right _ h₁
  rw [coeff_derivativeFun, map_add, coeff_mul_eq_coeff_trunc_mul_trunc _ _ (lt_succ_self _),
    smul_eq_mul, smul_eq_mul, coeff_mul_eq_coeff_trunc_mul_trunc₂ g f.derivativeFun h₂ h₁,
    coeff_mul_eq_coeff_trunc_mul_trunc₂ f g.derivativeFun h₂ h₁, trunc_derivativeFun,
    trunc_derivativeFun, ← map_add, ← derivativeFun_coe_mul_coe, coeff_derivativeFun]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Derivative/Variant772427da7b90dba5b6f222fed2b8edfcf63e3a57e64d87e622ce0c58d5176d9f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Derivative/Variant772427da7b90dba5b6f222fed2b8edfcf63e3a57e64d87e622ce0c58d5176d9f.lean#L85).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `249c0316e681afa432d7115d7e136f83c002d858` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
