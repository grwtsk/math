## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ba8d5aad-2edc-9683-4c91-3a2c170ab6e1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 113–125.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_bot_or_top : I = ⊥ ∨ I = ⊤ := by
  rw [or_iff_not_imp_right]
  change _ ≠ _ → _
  rw [Ideal.ne_top_iff_one]
  intro h1
  rw [eq_bot_iff]
  intro r hr
  by_cases H : r = 0; · simpa
  simpa [H, h1] using I.mul_mem_left r⁻¹ hr

end Ideal

end DivisionSemiring
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Lattice/Variant173a223288390dfc6b818bb02aadee638ec5eeaaa4d2c37c7c396ac553f02c97.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Lattice/Variant173a223288390dfc6b818bb02aadee638ec5eeaaa4d2c37c7c396ac553f02c97.lean#L113).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `92e71ddd2c18b6f79b065937c1c8465bc37c8da3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
