## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:210df0366dd3aa7c103c0fd7b6b1acec9eb1bbf8d91828f85d5ff72ed505e360`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 639–647.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev adjoinCommSemiringOfComm {s : Set A} (hcomm : ∀ a ∈ s, ∀ b ∈ s, a * b = b * a) :
    CommSemiring (adjoin R s) :=
  { (adjoin R s).toSemiring with
    mul_comm := fun ⟨_, h₁⟩ ⟨_, h₂⟩ ↦
      have := adjoin_le_centralizer_centralizer R s
      Subtype.ext <| Set.centralizer_centralizer_comm_of_comm hcomm _ (this h₁) _ (this h₂) }

variable {R}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Lattice/Variant41c93f7e16c218dacf0708bf0c1895cf5cfed779587161cd32e78bb750744815.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Lattice/Variant41c93f7e16c218dacf0708bf0c1895cf5cfed779587161cd32e78bb750744815.lean#L639).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `49b32bd83e8a3d594078fad84215f0c3e76463cf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
