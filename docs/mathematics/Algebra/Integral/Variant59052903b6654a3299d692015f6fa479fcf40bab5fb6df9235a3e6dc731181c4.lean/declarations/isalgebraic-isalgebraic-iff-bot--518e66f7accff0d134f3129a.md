## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f71698f3-028f-960a-bead-a1a90acb1a60`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 341–349.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsAlgebraic.isAlgebraic_iff_bot [Algebra.IsAlgebraic S A] [FaithfulSMul S A] :
    Algebra.IsAlgebraic R S ↔ Algebra.IsAlgebraic R A :=
  ⟨fun _ ↦ .trans R S A, fun _ ↦ .tower_bot_of_injective (FaithfulSMul.algebraMap_injective S A)⟩

end Algebra

variable (R S)
/-- If `R` is a domain and `S` is an arbitrary `R`-algebra, then the elements of `S`
that are algebraic over `R` form a subalgebra. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Integral/Variant59052903b6654a3299d692015f6fa479fcf40bab5fb6df9235a3e6dc731181c4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Integral/Variant59052903b6654a3299d692015f6fa479fcf40bab5fb6df9235a3e6dc731181c4.lean#L341).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `47006b07cbee8d38f05dfd040e1fbcdcccabf3f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
