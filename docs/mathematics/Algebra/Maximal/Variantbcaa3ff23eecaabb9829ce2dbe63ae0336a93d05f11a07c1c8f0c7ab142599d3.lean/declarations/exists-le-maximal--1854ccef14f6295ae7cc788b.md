## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aa3d0f40-02c8-7b0e-3c99-97f025bcf416`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 77–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_le_maximal (I : Ideal α) (hI : I ≠ ⊤) : ∃ M : Ideal α, M.IsMaximal ∧ I ≤ M :=
  let ⟨m, hm⟩ := (eq_top_or_exists_le_coatom I).resolve_left hI
  ⟨m, ⟨⟨hm.1⟩, hm.2⟩⟩

variable (α) in
/-- Krull's theorem: a nontrivial ring has a maximal ideal. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Maximal/Variantbcaa3ff23eecaabb9829ce2dbe63ae0336a93d05f11a07c1c8f0c7ab142599d3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Maximal/Variantbcaa3ff23eecaabb9829ce2dbe63ae0336a93d05f11a07c1c8f0c7ab142599d3.lean#L77).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dcd05babd6e01a85e9d5457e9d693384065fb250` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
