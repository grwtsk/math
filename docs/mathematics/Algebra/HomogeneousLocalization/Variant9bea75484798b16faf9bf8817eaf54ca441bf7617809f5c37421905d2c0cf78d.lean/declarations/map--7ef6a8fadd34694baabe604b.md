## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:94b0ceca50cbb160e6ec64f376d95b2302d2e7d335d28fe52d234bd44d157a43`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 680–702.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def map (g : 𝒜 →+*ᵍ ℬ) (comap_le : P ≤ Q.comap g) :
    HomogeneousLocalization 𝒜 P →+* HomogeneousLocalization ℬ Q where
  toFun := Quotient.map'
    (fun x ↦ ⟨x.1, ⟨_, map_mem g x.2.2⟩, ⟨_, map_mem g x.3.2⟩, comap_le x.4⟩)
    fun x y (e : x.embedding = y.embedding) ↦ by
      apply_fun IsLocalization.map (Localization Q) g.toRingHom comap_le at e
      simp_rw [HomogeneousLocalization.NumDenSameDeg.embedding, Localization.mk_eq_mk',
        IsLocalization.map_mk', ← Localization.mk_eq_mk'] at e
      exact e
  map_add' := Quotient.ind₂' fun x y ↦ by
    simp only [← mk_add, Quotient.map'_mk'', num_add, map_add, map_mul, den_add]; rfl
  map_mul' := Quotient.ind₂' fun x y ↦ by
    simp only [← mk_mul, Quotient.map'_mk'', num_mul, map_mul, den_mul]; rfl
  map_zero' := by simp only [← mk_zero (𝒜 := 𝒜), Quotient.map'_mk'', deg_zero,
    num_zero, ZeroMemClass.coe_zero, map_zero, den_zero, map_one]; rfl
  map_one' := by simp only [← mk_one (𝒜 := 𝒜), Quotient.map'_mk'',
    num_one, den_one, map_one]; rfl

variable (𝒜) in
/--
Let `A` be a graded ring and `P ≤ Q` be two submonoids, then the homogeneous localization of `A`
at `P` embeds into the homogeneous localization of `A` at `Q`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/HomogeneousLocalization/Variant9bea75484798b16faf9bf8817eaf54ca441bf7617809f5c37421905d2c0cf78d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/HomogeneousLocalization/Variant9bea75484798b16faf9bf8817eaf54ca441bf7617809f5c37421905d2c0cf78d.lean#L680).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1db610140c3810aa209c8759b3fdf996ecd5a3b4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
