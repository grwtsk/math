## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0dbf1e38-ed7a-ad19-824b-209c026778cd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 718–725.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_comp {f : 𝒜 →+*ᵍ ℬ} {g : ℬ →+*ᵍ 𝒞}
    {P : Submonoid A} {Q : Submonoid B} {R : Submonoid C}
    (hpq : P ≤ Q.comap f) (hqr : Q ≤ R.comap g) :
    map (g.comp f) (hpq.trans <| Submonoid.monotone_comap hqr) = (map g hqr).comp (map f hpq) := by
  ext x
  obtain ⟨c, rfl⟩ := x.mk_surjective
  simp [map_mk]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/HomogeneousLocalization/Variant9bea75484798b16faf9bf8817eaf54ca441bf7617809f5c37421905d2c0cf78d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/HomogeneousLocalization/Variant9bea75484798b16faf9bf8817eaf54ca441bf7617809f5c37421905d2c0cf78d.lean#L718).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1db610140c3810aa209c8759b3fdf996ecd5a3b4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
