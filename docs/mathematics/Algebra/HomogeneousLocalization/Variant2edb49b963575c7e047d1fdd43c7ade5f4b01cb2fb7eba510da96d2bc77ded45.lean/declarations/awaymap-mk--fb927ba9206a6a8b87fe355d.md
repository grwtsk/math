## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e57a5b47-2bc4-bffd-3979-71ae8ffcdeec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 746–759.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma awayMap_mk {d : ι} (n : ℕ) (hf : f ∈ 𝒜 d) (a : A) (ha : a ∈ 𝒜 (n • d)) :
    awayMap 𝒜 hg hx (Away.mk 𝒜 hf n a ha) = Away.mk 𝒜 (hx ▸ mul_mem_graded hf hg) n
      (a * g ^ n) (by rw [smul_add]; exact mul_mem_graded ha (pow_mem_graded n hg)) := by
  ext
  exact val_awayMap_mk ..

end mapAway

section isLocalization

variable {𝒜 : ℕ → Submodule R A} [GradedAlgebra 𝒜]
variable {e d : ℕ} {f : A} (hf : f ∈ 𝒜 d) {g : A} (hg : g ∈ 𝒜 e)

/-- The element `t := g ^ d / f ^ e` such that `A_{(fg)} = A_{(f)}[1/t]`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/HomogeneousLocalization/Variant2edb49b963575c7e047d1fdd43c7ade5f4b01cb2fb7eba510da96d2bc77ded45.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/HomogeneousLocalization/Variant2edb49b963575c7e047d1fdd43c7ade5f4b01cb2fb7eba510da96d2bc77ded45.lean#L746).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `38300e7a2a2befa2a7a8c0432a959d87ca5669d7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
