## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e1644885-dcdc-184e-3b88-27b756649938`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 635–651.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma map_mk (g : A →+* B)
    (comap_le : P ≤ Q.comap g) (hg : ∀ i, ∀ a ∈ 𝒜 i, g a ∈ ℬ i) (x) :
    map 𝒜 ℬ g comap_le hg (mk x) =
    mk ⟨x.1, ⟨_, hg _ _ x.2.2⟩, ⟨_, hg _ _ x.3.2⟩, comap_le x.4⟩ :=

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/HomogeneousLocalization/Variant2edb49b963575c7e047d1fdd43c7ade5f4b01cb2fb7eba510da96d2bc77ded45.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/HomogeneousLocalization/Variant2edb49b963575c7e047d1fdd43c7ade5f4b01cb2fb7eba510da96d2bc77ded45.lean#L635).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `38300e7a2a2befa2a7a8c0432a959d87ca5669d7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
