## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8b296d66c7084b290b2cb304f1893793605fb5667c9ddc142696e95c4ab7eb79`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 502–508.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def fromZeroRingHom : 𝒜 0 →+* HomogeneousLocalization 𝒜 x where
  toFun f := .mk ⟨0, f, 1, one_mem _⟩
  map_one' := rfl
  map_mul' f g := by ext; simp [Localization.mk_mul]
  map_zero' := rfl
  map_add' f g := by ext; simp [Localization.add_mk, add_comm f.1 g.1]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/HomogeneousLocalization/Variant5781ef0b0580c0ed7831dfff3b4d29cc326c44e9b005c7400b8586803df16ea8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/HomogeneousLocalization/Variant5781ef0b0580c0ed7831dfff3b4d29cc326c44e9b005c7400b8586803df16ea8.lean#L502).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b7fc718214a8af38f308ad3cc88e05103e43b705` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
