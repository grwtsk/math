## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8a756766310bfda0b5ce542f8753c85ecffdd486ea65a0a8cb16ac8d054c6ecd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–155.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ofTwoCocycle {R L M} [CommRing R] [LieRing L] [LieAlgebra R L] [AddCommGroup M]
    [Module R M] [LieRingModule L M] [LieModule R L M]
    (c : twoCocycle R L M) where
  /-- The underlying type. -/
  carrier : L × M

variable [AddCommGroup M] [Module R M] [LieRingModule L M] [LieModule R L M]
  (c : twoCocycle R L M)

/-- An equivalence between the direct product and the corresponding one-field structure. This is
used to transfer the additive and scalar-multiple structure on the direct product to the type
synonym. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Extension/Variantcc9dfd4481d4bff0e3af92c1f6fb5731f4bc6345de7e343f61adbbb8e1fa1ba0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Extension/Variantcc9dfd4481d4bff0e3af92c1f6fb5731f4bc6345de7e343f61adbbb8e1fa1ba0.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ab9ba471259a2b2625021c90af021e73648d061d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
