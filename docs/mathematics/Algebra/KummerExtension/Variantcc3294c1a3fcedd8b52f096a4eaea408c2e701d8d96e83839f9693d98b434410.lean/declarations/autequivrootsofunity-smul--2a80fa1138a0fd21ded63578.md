## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:31b161c5-fb14-4579-3443-771633ac054c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 423–438.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma autEquivRootsOfUnity_smul [NeZero n] (σ : Gal(L/K)) :
    autEquivRootsOfUnity hζ H L σ • α = σ α := by
  have ⟨ζ, hζ'⟩ := hζ
  have hn := NeZero.pos n
  rw [mem_primitiveRoots hn] at hζ'
  rw [← mem_nthRoots hn, (hζ'.map_of_injective (algebraMap K L).injective).nthRoots_eq
    (rootOfSplitsXPowSubC_pow a L)] at hα
  simp only [Multiset.mem_map, Multiset.mem_range] at hα
  obtain ⟨i, _, rfl⟩ := hα
  simp only [← map_pow, ← Algebra.smul_def, map_smul,
    autEquivRootsOfUnity_apply_rootOfSplit hζ H L]
  exact smul_comm _ _ _

/-- Suppose `L/K` is the splitting field of `Xⁿ - a`, and `ζ` is an `n`-th primitive root of unity
in `K`, then `Gal(L/K)` is isomorphic to `ZMod n`. -/
noncomputable
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/KummerExtension/Variantcc3294c1a3fcedd8b52f096a4eaea408c2e701d8d96e83839f9693d98b434410.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/KummerExtension/Variantcc3294c1a3fcedd8b52f096a4eaea408c2e701d8d96e83839f9693d98b434410.lean#L423).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aca0c1f3380eccc1886d0a8571a1cbfb029c9487` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
