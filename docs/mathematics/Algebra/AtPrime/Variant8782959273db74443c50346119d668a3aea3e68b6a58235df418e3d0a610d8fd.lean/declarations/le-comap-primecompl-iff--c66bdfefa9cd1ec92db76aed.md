## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2fa5dcd6-df90-ed8d-2cd7-45ee981f2af7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 190–204.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem le_comap_primeCompl_iff {J : Ideal P} [J.IsPrime] {f : R →+* P} :
    I.primeCompl ≤ J.primeCompl.comap f ↔ J.comap f ≤ I :=
  ⟨fun h x hx => by
    contrapose! hx
    exact h hx,
   fun h _ hx hfxJ => hx (h hfxJ)⟩

variable (I)

/-- For a ring hom `f : R →+* S` and a prime ideal `J` in `S`, the induced ring hom from the
localization of `R` at `J.comap f` to the localization of `S` at `J`.

To make this definition more flexible, we allow any ideal `I` of `R` as input, together with a proof
that `I = J.comap f`. This can be useful when `I` is not definitionally equal to `J.comap f`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/AtPrime/Variant8782959273db74443c50346119d668a3aea3e68b6a58235df418e3d0a610d8fd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/AtPrime/Variant8782959273db74443c50346119d668a3aea3e68b6a58235df418e3d0a610d8fd.lean#L190).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3169c6cc8c08926425ef8e8133332988c64d0ad2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
