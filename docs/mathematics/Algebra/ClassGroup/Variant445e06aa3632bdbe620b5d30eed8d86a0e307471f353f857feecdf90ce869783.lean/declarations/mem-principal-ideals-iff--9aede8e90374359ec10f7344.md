## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4633659f-ec24-f363-7190-c3fbf85ae63b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 71–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_principal_ideals_iff {I : (FractionalIdeal R⁰ K)ˣ} :
    I ∈ (toPrincipalIdeal R K).range ↔ ∃ x : K, spanSingleton R⁰ x = I := by
  simp only [MonoidHom.mem_range, toPrincipalIdeal_eq_iff]
  constructor <;> rintro ⟨x, hx⟩
  · exact ⟨x, hx⟩
  · refine ⟨Units.mk0 x ?_, hx⟩
    rintro rfl
    simp [I.ne_zero.symm] at hx

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/ClassGroup/Variant445e06aa3632bdbe620b5d30eed8d86a0e307471f353f857feecdf90ce869783.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/ClassGroup/Variant445e06aa3632bdbe620b5d30eed8d86a0e307471f353f857feecdf90ce869783.lean#L71).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
