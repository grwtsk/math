## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b79755ca-9af8-ed7e-23e7-2191b32e7057`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 117–122.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ClassGroup.mk_eq_mk {I J : (FractionalIdeal R⁰ <| FractionRing R)ˣ} :
    ClassGroup.mk I = ClassGroup.mk J ↔
      ∃ x : (FractionRing R)ˣ, I * toPrincipalIdeal R (FractionRing R) x = J := by
  rw [mk_def, mk_def, QuotientGroup.mk'_eq_mk']
  simp [RingEquiv.coe_monoidHom_refl, MonoidHom.mem_range, -toPrincipalIdeal_eq_iff]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/ClassGroup/Variant445e06aa3632bdbe620b5d30eed8d86a0e307471f353f857feecdf90ce869783.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/ClassGroup/Variant445e06aa3632bdbe620b5d30eed8d86a0e307471f353f857feecdf90ce869783.lean#L117).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5c8845b904c5fa31d7b7c381e31820785303acad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
