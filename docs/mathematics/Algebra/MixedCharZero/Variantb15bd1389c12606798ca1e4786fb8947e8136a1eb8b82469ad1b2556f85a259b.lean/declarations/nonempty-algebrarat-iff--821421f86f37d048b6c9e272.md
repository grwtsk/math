## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:01e8a249-0149-0f97-504b-7620e4d66d6d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 272–286.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nonempty_algebraRat_iff :
    Nonempty (Algebra ℚ R) ↔ ∀ I : Ideal R, I ≠ ⊤ → CharZero (R ⧸ I) := by
  constructor
  · intro h_alg
    haveI h_alg' : Algebra ℚ R := h_alg.some
    apply of_algebraRat
  · intro h
    apply Nonempty.intro
    exact algebraRat h

end EqualCharZero

/--
A ring of characteristic zero is not a `ℚ`-algebra iff it has mixed characteristic for some `p`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/MixedCharZero/Variantb15bd1389c12606798ca1e4786fb8947e8136a1eb8b82469ad1b2556f85a259b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/MixedCharZero/Variantb15bd1389c12606798ca1e4786fb8947e8136a1eb8b82469ad1b2556f85a259b.lean#L272).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5b7e50c2b392c5230908212a84908ede818c323e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
