## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ea0ef34bdb7ffc95fec55a5ae132ab08c70668ac25f660e5a07ca4d18adf5d29`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 510–522.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance GradeZero.commSemiring : CommSemiring (A 0) :=
  Function.Injective.commSemiring (of A 0) DFinsupp.single_injective (of A 0).map_zero
    (of_zero_one A) (of A 0).map_add (of_zero_mul A) (fun x n => DFinsupp.single_smul n x)
    (fun _ _ => of_zero_pow _ _ _) (ofNatCast A)
#align direct_sum.grade_zero.comm_semiring DirectSum.GradeZero.commSemiring

end CommSemiring

section Ring

variable [∀ i, AddCommGroup (A i)] [AddZeroClass ι] [GNonUnitalNonAssocSemiring A]

/-- The `NonUnitalNonAssocRing` derived from `GNonUnitalNonAssocSemiring A`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/Variantbef42e0642c3451a90a2990ddfab8c901f8e289561ccb5c02e83ebf4ada6bdc9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ring/Variantbef42e0642c3451a90a2990ddfab8c901f8e289561ccb5c02e83ebf4ada6bdc9.lean#L510).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0ca5de1267dc40b8cac9d3173012e393b84f3236` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
