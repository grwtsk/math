## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a366f4d70f7786726cbdfbc20b136f6d5ef95f096cdff2b07ee6dcc3553b3a99`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 455–465.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance GradeZero.module {i} : Module (A 0) (A i) :=
  letI := Module.compHom (⨁ i, A i) (ofZeroRingHom A)
  DFinsupp.single_injective.module (A 0) (of A i) fun a => of_zero_smul A a

end Semiring

section CommSemiring

variable [∀ i, AddCommMonoid (A i)] [AddCommMonoid ι] [GCommSemiring A]

/-- The `CommSemiring` structure derived from `GCommSemiring A`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/Variantc0da39fc3ae976deff225c3204e1a3305390da6098b8a5d4c41faa641904bcf9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ring/Variantc0da39fc3ae976deff225c3204e1a3305390da6098b8a5d4c41faa641904bcf9.lean#L455).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fbc18a1a20551c9954c156e0c4d8cd2f94d2a29a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
