## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d3e20c75-6949-1b27-067d-e67e7b762f9f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 106–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem multiplicity_eq_count_normalizedFactors {a b : R} (ha : Irreducible a) (hb : b ≠ 0) :
    multiplicity a b = (normalizedFactors b).count (normalize a) := by
  have := emultiplicity_eq_count_normalizedFactors ha hb
  rwa [(finiteMultiplicity_of_emultiplicity_eq_natCast this).emultiplicity_eq_multiplicity,
    ENat.natCast_inj] at this

/-- The number of times an irreducible factor `p` appears in `normalizedFactors x` is defined by
the number of times it divides `x`.

See also `multiplicity_eq_count_normalizedFactors` if `n` is given by `multiplicity p x`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/Multiplicity/Variantbae1e41dcd5af71166e757c3433c87392e53df624c840ae1fe334b3a5489fbfb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RingTheory/Multiplicity/Variantbae1e41dcd5af71166e757c3433c87392e53df624c840ae1fe334b3a5489fbfb.lean#L106).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `28c36c20f220e2ea147c67418758873c56455f68` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
