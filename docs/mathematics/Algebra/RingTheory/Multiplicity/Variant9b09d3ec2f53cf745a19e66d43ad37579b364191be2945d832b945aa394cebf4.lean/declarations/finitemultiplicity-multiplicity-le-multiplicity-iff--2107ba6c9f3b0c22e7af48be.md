## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e1d180f8-def7-0924-4ccf-e915db6f51e2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 385–390.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem FiniteMultiplicity.multiplicity_le_multiplicity_iff {c d : β} (hab : FiniteMultiplicity a b)
    (hcd : FiniteMultiplicity c d) :
    multiplicity a b ≤ multiplicity c d ↔ ∀ n : ℕ, a ^ n ∣ b → c ^ n ∣ d := by
  rw [← ENat.natCast_le_natCast, ← hab.emultiplicity_eq_multiplicity,
    ← hcd.emultiplicity_eq_multiplicity, emultiplicity_le_emultiplicity_iff]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/Multiplicity/Variant9b09d3ec2f53cf745a19e66d43ad37579b364191be2945d832b945aa394cebf4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RingTheory/Multiplicity/Variant9b09d3ec2f53cf745a19e66d43ad37579b364191be2945d832b945aa394cebf4.lean#L385).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a0d475532761e3f6d3405368eefb04a1a05a4707` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
