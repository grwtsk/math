## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7d7750ba-f2a2-dcf4-5ce0-2849d3c74f54`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–125.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem isRelPrime_of_no_irreducible_factors {x y : α} (nonzero : ¬(x = 0 ∧ y = 0))
    (H : ∀ z : α, Irreducible z → z ∣ x → ¬z ∣ y) : IsRelPrime x y :=

    have ⟨i, h1, h2⟩ := exists_irreducible_factor znu znz
    H i h1 (h2.trans zx) (h2.trans zy)

Unique factorization monoids are defined as `CancelCommMonoidWithZero`s with well-founded
strict divisibility relations, but this is equivalent to more familiar definitions:

Each element (except zero) is uniquely represented as a multiset of irreducible factors.
Uniqueness is only up to associated elements.

Each element (except zero) is non-uniquely represented as a multiset
of prime factors.

To define a UFD using the definition in terms of multisets
of irreducible factors, use the definition `of_existsUnique_irreducible_factors`

To define a UFD using the definition in terms of multisets
of prime factors, use the definition `of_exists_prime_factors`

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/Defs/Variant0209f3a6a04aa170e7225ce9a6e80b87449d23743bad8b37c874e3909c741624.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RingTheory/Defs/Variant0209f3a6a04aa170e7225ce9a6e80b87449d23743bad8b37c874e3909c741624.lean#L97).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7bbf24774a965a3757a742d3099717862a91a12f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
