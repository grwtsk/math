## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c3ae2e48-cb73-974b-696e-dffe1d4ad868`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 535–547.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem partition_theorem (n : ℕ) :
    (Nat.Partition.odds n).card = (Nat.Partition.distincts n).card := by
  -- We need the counts to live in some field (which contains ℕ), so let's just use ℚ
  suffices ((Nat.Partition.odds n).card : ℚ) = (Nat.Partition.distincts n).card by
    exact_mod_cast this
  rw [distinctGF_prop n (n + 1) (by linarith)]
  rw [oddGF_prop n (n + 1) (by linarith)]
  apply same_coeffs (n + 1) n n.le_succ
#align theorems_100.partition_theorem Theorems100.partition_theorem

end

end Theorems100
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/Partition/Variant3c1bec8337d034bd4e048940206d2a13ded69e79b761b375abe0451398ca486d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RingTheory/Partition/Variant3c1bec8337d034bd4e048940206d2a13ded69e79b761b375abe0451398ca486d.lean#L535).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fd3803481cce58398a936482e24df9e892c5ef87` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
