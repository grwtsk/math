## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bacfe8b02f39b4a24b678bcdc91ae7a712c0fbce4db2c1eb8d88a758e70fcde3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 61–74.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
meta def evalIntFloor : PositivityExt where eval {u α} _zα pα? e :=
  match pα? with | none => pure .none | some _ => do
  match u, α, e with
  | 0, ~q(ℤ), ~q(@Int.floor $α' $ir $io $j $a) =>
    match ← core q(inferInstance) (some q(inferInstance)) a with
    | .positive pa =>
        assertInstancesCommute
        pure (.nonnegative q(int_floor_nonneg_of_pos (α := $α') $pa))
    | .nonnegative pa =>
        assertInstancesCommute
        pure (.nonnegative q(int_floor_nonneg (α := $α') $pa))
    | _ => pure .none
  | _, _, _ => throwError "failed to match on Int.floor application"

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/Variantbf8d7bd183b7325826b1af25a184e305a62d8e1e2ba9ebca2913b9735f6463fc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ring/Variantbf8d7bd183b7325826b1af25a184e305a62d8e1e2ba9ebca2913b9735f6463fc.lean#L61).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6c269ea74648e5511200290fad239669ae7eb3a8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
