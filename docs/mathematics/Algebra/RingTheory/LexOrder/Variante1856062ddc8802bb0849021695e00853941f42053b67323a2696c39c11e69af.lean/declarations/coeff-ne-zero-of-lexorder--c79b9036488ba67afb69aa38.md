## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1141dacd-4c65-78da-a28d-9eea25849a95`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 76–88.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coeff_ne_zero_of_lexOrder {φ : MvPowerSeries σ R} {d : σ →₀ ℕ}
    (h : toLex d = lexOrder φ) : coeff R d φ ≠ 0 := by
  have hφ : φ ≠ 0 := by
    simp only [ne_eq, ← lexOrder_eq_top_iff_eq_zero, ← h, WithTop.coe_ne_top, not_false_eq_true]
  have hφ' := lexOrder_def_of_ne_zero hφ
  rcases hφ' with ⟨ne, hφ'⟩
  simp only [← h, WithTop.coe_eq_coe] at hφ'
  suffices toLex d ∈ toLex '' φ.support by
    simp only [Set.mem_image_equiv, toLex_symm_eq, ofLex_toLex, Function.mem_support, ne_eq] at this
    apply this
  rw [hφ']
  apply WellFounded.min_mem

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/LexOrder/Variante1856062ddc8802bb0849021695e00853941f42053b67323a2696c39c11e69af.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RingTheory/LexOrder/Variante1856062ddc8802bb0849021695e00853941f42053b67323a2696c39c11e69af.lean#L76).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `596e2c44b9e3aa8d5477f9cc5c048af97ada8da5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
