## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4d21cfb4-70c8-9005-25fc-488f95ff88b9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 172–183.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem one_def : 1 = DirectSum.of A 0 GradedMonoid.GOne.one := rfl

end One

section Mul

variable [Add ι] [∀ i, AddCommMonoid (A i)] [GNonUnitalNonAssocSemiring A]

open AddMonoidHom (flip_apply coe_comp compHom)

/-- The piecewise multiplication from the `Mul` instance, as a bundled homomorphism. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/Variant69bf27e66e61f1112a389f63fc4ecc91abf7b163d3656c741f050a1e044b93d4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ring/Variant69bf27e66e61f1112a389f63fc4ecc91abf7b163d3656c741f050a1e044b93d4.lean#L172).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c589fe8d50a84528feef71b124cad99fabc4514e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
