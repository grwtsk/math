## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d04c98ae-001a-2d61-8bfc-7c6d8a8935a5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 148–165.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem natCast_le_natCast_of_le (a b : Nat) : a ≤ b → (a : R) ≤ (b : R) := by
  induction a generalizing b <;> cases b <;> simp [- Std.le_refl]

  next n =>
    have := ofNat_nonneg (R := R) n
    simp [Semiring.ofNat_eq_natCast] at this
    rw [Semiring.natCast_zero] at this
    simp [Semiring.natCast_zero, Semiring.natCast_add, Semiring.natCast_one]
    replace this := OrderedAdd.add_le_left_iff 1 |>.mp this
    rw [Semiring.add_comm, Semiring.add_zero] at this
    replace this := Std.lt_of_lt_of_le zero_lt_one this
    exact Std.le_of_lt this
  next n ih m =>
    intro h
    replace ih := ih _ h
    simp [Semiring.natCast_add, Semiring.natCast_one]
    exact OrderedAdd.add_le_left_iff _ |>.mp ih

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/Variant7aa9f9fe43797c1d4cc78198dbad37f181882345f7451566fe325d6fead51a22.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ring/Variant7aa9f9fe43797c1d4cc78198dbad37f181882345f7451566fe325d6fead51a22.lean#L148).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `350cbc6d49b24051540cf5d302d0b3db629d8b9d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
