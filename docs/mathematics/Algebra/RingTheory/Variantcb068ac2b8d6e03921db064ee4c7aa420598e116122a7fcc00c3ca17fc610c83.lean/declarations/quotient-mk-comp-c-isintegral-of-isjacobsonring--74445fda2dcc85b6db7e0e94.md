## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2a878d40-e1e8-e893-cbaa-54c6639f2d7d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 641–647.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem quotient_mk_comp_C_isIntegral_of_isJacobsonRing {R : Type*} [CommRing R] [IsJacobsonRing R]
    (P : Ideal (MvPolynomial (Fin n) R)) [hP : P.IsMaximal] :
    RingHom.IsIntegral (RingHom.comp (Ideal.Quotient.mk P) (MvPolynomial.C)) := by
  change RingHom.IsIntegral (algebraMap R (MvPolynomial (Fin n) R ⧸ P))
  apply quotient_mk_comp_C_isIntegral_of_isJacobsonRing'
  infer_instance

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/Variantcb068ac2b8d6e03921db064ee4c7aa420598e116122a7fcc00c3ca17fc610c83.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ring/Variantcb068ac2b8d6e03921db064ee4c7aa420598e116122a7fcc00c3ca17fc610c83.lean#L641).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7fb35473abe6e0a02c75127a03e061e8940348e8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
