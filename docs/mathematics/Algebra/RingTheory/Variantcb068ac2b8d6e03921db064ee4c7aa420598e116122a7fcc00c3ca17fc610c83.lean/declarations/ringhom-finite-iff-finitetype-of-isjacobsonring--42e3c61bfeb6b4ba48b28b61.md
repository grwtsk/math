## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c7a9fc40-f830-bd3e-9175-05fe5090e31c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 699–706.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma RingHom.finite_iff_finiteType_of_isJacobsonRing
    {R S : Type*} [CommRing R] [IsJacobsonRing R] [Field S]
    {f : R →+* S} : f.Finite ↔ f.FiniteType :=
  ⟨RingHom.FiniteType.of_finite,
    by intro; algebraize [f]; exact finite_of_finite_type_of_isJacobsonRing R S⟩

/-- If `K` is a Jacobson Noetherian ring, `A` a nontrivial `K`-algebra of finite type,
then any `K`-subfield of `A` is finite over `K`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/Variantcb068ac2b8d6e03921db064ee4c7aa420598e116122a7fcc00c3ca17fc610c83.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ring/Variantcb068ac2b8d6e03921db064ee4c7aa420598e116122a7fcc00c3ca17fc610c83.lean#L699).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7fb35473abe6e0a02c75127a03e061e8940348e8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
