## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b38f1345-689d-16fc-97aa-402379e011ab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 295–306.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_finite_support (x : FreeCommRing α) : ∃ s : Set α, Set.Finite s ∧ IsSupported x s :=
  FreeCommRing.induction_on x ⟨∅, Set.finite_empty, isSupported_neg isSupported_one⟩
    (fun p => ⟨{p}, Set.finite_singleton p, isSupported_of.2 <| Set.mem_singleton _⟩)
    (fun _ _ ⟨s, hfs, hxs⟩ ⟨t, hft, hxt⟩ =>
      ⟨s ∪ t, hfs.union hft,
        isSupported_add (isSupported_upwards hxs Set.subset_union_left)
          (isSupported_upwards hxt Set.subset_union_right)⟩)
    fun _ _ ⟨s, hfs, hxs⟩ ⟨t, hft, hxt⟩ =>
    ⟨s ∪ t, hfs.union hft,
      isSupported_mul (isSupported_upwards hxs Set.subset_union_left)
        (isSupported_upwards hxt Set.subset_union_right)⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/FreeCommRing/Variant7201b161e895abc75d3c6988324e12281119c58d59d58bebdb2165187d23a47f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RingTheory/FreeCommRing/Variant7201b161e895abc75d3c6988324e12281119c58d59d58bebdb2165187d23a47f.lean#L295).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77adf951a4485b6d44b1f81457c91cb4dc04d0f9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
