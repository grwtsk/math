## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:05c0b5008dd2a125aca0f4451a6273c0edaec5f2c76492f8d6800f1f4033e7a6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 623–629.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {Γ₀ : Type*} [LinearOrderedCommGroupWithZero Γ₀] {v : Valuation R Γ₀}
    [hv : v.IsNontrivial] : Nontrivial (MonoidWithZeroHom.valueMonoid (.ofClass v)) := by
  obtain ⟨x, h0, h1⟩ := hv.exists_val_nontrivial
  rw [Submonoid.nontrivial_iff_exists_ne_one]
  use (Units.mk0 (v x) h0), (MonoidWithZeroHom.ofClass v).mem_valueMonoid (Set.mem_range_self x)
  simpa [Units.ext_iff]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/Basic/Variantb689d2dae4275d29b812732d7683e5ef61cdd7742d0b664474555e5c36725ce3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RingTheory/Basic/Variantb689d2dae4275d29b812732d7683e5ef61cdd7742d0b664474555e5c36725ce3.lean#L623).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f2ffabc54da049d773c1bb0bd8112a123794157` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
