## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:697c4398-5efd-f31b-c4a4-caf15c9e10ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 270–278.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma radical_dvd_radical_iff_normalizedFactors_subset_normalizedFactors :
    radical a ∣ radical b ↔ normalizedFactors a ⊆ normalizedFactors b := by
  obtain rfl | ha₀ := eq_or_ne a 0
  · simp
  have : Nontrivial M := ⟨a, 0, ha₀⟩
  rw [dvd_iff_normalizedFactors_le_normalizedFactors radical_ne_zero radical_ne_zero,
    Multiset.le_iff_subset (normalizedFactors_nodup isRadical_radical)]
  simp only [Multiset.subset_iff, ← mem_primeFactors, primeFactors_radical]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/Basic/Variantb83edfca227f9e3f6018d0a38fe2c40d1ad3a08ddfad603b43d03c1163c42e22.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RingTheory/Basic/Variantb83edfca227f9e3f6018d0a38fe2c40d1ad3a08ddfad603b43d03c1163c42e22.lean#L270).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c1d676991ce863bb4e497a44596cda8d3b4e3dba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
