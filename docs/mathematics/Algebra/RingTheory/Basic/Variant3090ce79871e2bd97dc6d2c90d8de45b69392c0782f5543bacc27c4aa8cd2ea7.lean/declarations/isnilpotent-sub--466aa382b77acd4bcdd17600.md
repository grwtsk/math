## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:be6f794a-f228-be9f-88c0-7e4d38a5f837`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 219–233.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isNilpotent_sub (h_comm : Commute x y) (hx : IsNilpotent x) (hy : IsNilpotent y) :
    IsNilpotent (x - y) := by
  rw [← neg_right_iff] at h_comm
  rw [← isNilpotent_neg_iff] at hy
  rw [sub_eq_add_neg]
  exact h_comm.isNilpotent_add hx hy

end Ring

end Commute

section CommSemiring

variable [CommSemiring R]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingTheory/Basic/Variant3090ce79871e2bd97dc6d2c90d8de45b69392c0782f5543bacc27c4aa8cd2ea7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RingTheory/Basic/Variant3090ce79871e2bd97dc6d2c90d8de45b69392c0782f5543bacc27c4aa8cd2ea7.lean#L219).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `488fc0f6a3d7d28c079a8a167aeffb3132f9fc05` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
