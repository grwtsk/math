## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7bb3261c2612648f285c0577e27c29bc558a93234042ab551f3b6c6afb410ea3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–65.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev gradeBy (f : M → ι) (i : ι) : Submodule R R[M] where
  carrier := { a | ∀ m, m ∈ a.coeff.support → f m = i }
  zero_mem' m h := by cases h
  add_mem' {a b} ha hb m h := by
    classical exact (Finset.mem_union.mp (Finsupp.support_add h)).elim (ha m) (hb m)
  smul_mem' _ _ h := Set.Subset.trans Finsupp.support_smul h

/-- The submodule corresponding to each grade. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Grading/Variant913d28a4928bdaed98bb6395b6beee7edbdf1ff61b24cb94e8ab9ee026f7d480.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Grading/Variant913d28a4928bdaed98bb6395b6beee7edbdf1ff61b24cb94e8ab9ee026f7d480.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6c542b81793c299ba8a0acac2ba5efa87d3b3e07` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
