## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d3185aeba1eefba6ebc90106273545dd4bc5009ee980df7cd4319ae89fcfaafc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 48–54.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class EssFiniteType : Prop where
  cond : ∃ s : Finset S,
    IsLocalization ((IsUnit.submonoid S).comap (algebraMap (adjoin R (s : Set S)) S)) S

/-- Let `S` be an `R`-algebra essentially of finite type, this is a choice of a finset `s ⊆ S`
such that `S` is the localization of `R[s]`. -/
noncomputable
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/EssentialFiniteness/Variant92ea9ecd0474f0013df29094d85f2c14aa28fa6fa72290df642b9534fdc13c0a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/EssentialFiniteness/Variant92ea9ecd0474f0013df29094d85f2c14aa28fa6fa72290df642b9534fdc13c0a.lean#L48).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `250e6f0a65f5ab54aabf6fa58a813c3242777f0d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
