## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7f278e321d94efd5a68e87adb0351ba61f6eef2e40415a7979bb80b154e4b009`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–77.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure MulActionHom where
  /-- The underlying function. -/
  toFun : X → Y
  /-- The proposition that the function preserves the action. -/
  map_smul' : ∀ (m : M') (x : X), toFun (m • x) = m • toFun x
#align mul_action_hom MulActionHom

notation:25 (name := «MulActionHomLocal≺») X " →[" M:25 "] " Y:0 => MulActionHom M X Y

/-- `SMulHomClass F M X Y` states that `F` is a type of morphisms preserving
scalar multiplication by `M`.

You should extend this class when you extend `MulActionHom`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupAction/Variant22262afef858460353a9cef5699129361b31cb8ad11588c899f117bf169815e6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupAction/Variant22262afef858460353a9cef5699129361b31cb8ad11588c899f117bf169815e6.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `286d2a40aea9492c39e17d2e3296b3b87b46f587` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
