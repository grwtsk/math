## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:da09227f53744b60da8aec8521f51024874e32ccc02cf90c6da359eb06aa03c4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 186–201.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def inverse (f : A →[M] B) (g : B → A) (h₁ : Function.LeftInverse g f)
    (h₂ : Function.RightInverse g f) : B →[M] A where
  toFun := g
  map_smul' m x :=
    calc
      g (m • x) = g (m • f (g x)) := by rw [h₂]
      _ = g (f (m • g x)) := by rw [f.map_smul]
      _ = m • g x := by rw [h₁]
#align mul_action_hom.inverse_to_fun MulActionHom.inverse_apply
#align mul_action_hom.inverse MulActionHom.inverse

end MulActionHom

/-- If actions of `M` and `N` on `α` commute, then for `c : M`, `(c • · : α → α)` is an `N`-action
homomorphism. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupAction/Variant2c8306de8527dadf5c7ad7642d14888f1c9d5d1ea200fdd31ac76a877bce0bd9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupAction/Variant2c8306de8527dadf5c7ad7642d14888f1c9d5d1ea200fdd31ac76a877bce0bd9.lean#L186).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `753e16c7185bf7e11cf3fb4f439e289cee3e6653` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
