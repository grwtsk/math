## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d66470e4-c6bb-3aca-27c1-2cfa7166f2ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 279–285.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem card_fixingSubgroup_eq_finrank [DecidablePred (· ∈ IntermediateField.fixingSubgroup K)]
    [FiniteDimensional F E] [IsGalois F E] :
    Fintype.card (IntermediateField.fixingSubgroup K) = finrank K E := by
  conv_rhs => rw [← fixedField_fixingSubgroup K, IntermediateField.finrank_fixedField_eq_card]
#align is_galois.card_fixing_subgroup_eq_finrank IsGalois.card_fixingSubgroup_eq_finrank

/-- The Galois correspondence from intermediate fields to subgroups -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Galois/Variant578a15ac62dac3ba6d6207a63c31938808ef1e1a0e3c91daba7d66dfcb7d0dde.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Galois/Variant578a15ac62dac3ba6d6207a63c31938808ef1e1a0e3c91daba7d66dfcb7d0dde.lean#L279).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `84dfd4c47cd981412183ba77424574c428b62a16` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
