## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e12b0b0c-b017-52a5-5da2-dbd26270e42d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 323–336.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem derivedLength_eq_derivedLengthOfIdeal (I : LieIdeal R L) :
    derivedLength R I = derivedLengthOfIdeal R L I := by
  let s₁ := { k | derivedSeries R I k = ⊥ }
  let s₂ := { k | derivedSeriesOfIdeal R L k I = ⊥ }
  change sInf s₁ = sInf s₂
  congr; ext k; exact I.derivedSeries_eq_bot_iff k
#align lie_algebra.derived_length_eq_derived_length_of_ideal LieAlgebra.derivedLength_eq_derivedLengthOfIdeal

variable {R L}

/-- Given a solvable Lie ideal `I` with derived series `I = D₀ ≥ D₁ ≥ ⋯ ≥ Dₖ = ⊥`, this is the
`k-1`th term in the derived series (and is therefore an Abelian ideal contained in `I`).

For a non-solvable ideal, this is the zero ideal, `⊥`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Solvable/Variant98233f3cd459bfd0160cce1feb0d95ecabbe056f8bbf70ee88b770a9a8d61e37.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Solvable/Variant98233f3cd459bfd0160cce1feb0d95ecabbe056f8bbf70ee88b770a9a8d61e37.lean#L323).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a60f7e03f5fde67c8376d5834ce6988cc1cd56b8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
