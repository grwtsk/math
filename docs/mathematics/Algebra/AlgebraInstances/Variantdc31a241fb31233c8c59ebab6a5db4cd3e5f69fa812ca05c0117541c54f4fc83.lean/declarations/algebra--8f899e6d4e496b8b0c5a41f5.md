## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ac83ea4345131d0ad0467232089ab85a07aa95002d7734e0f66613c1b45da60a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 56–69.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance algebra :
    Algebra (integralClosure v.valuationSubring L) (integralClosure v.valuationSubring E) :=
  RingHom.toAlgebra
    { toFun := fun k => ⟨algebraMap L E k, IsIntegral.algebraMap k.2⟩
      map_zero' :=
        Subtype.ext <| by simp only [Subtype.coe_mk, Subalgebra.coe_zero, map_zero]
      map_one' := Subtype.ext <| by simp only [Subtype.coe_mk, Subalgebra.coe_one, map_one]
      map_add' := fun x y =>
        Subtype.ext <| by simp only [map_add, Subalgebra.coe_add, Subtype.coe_mk]
      map_mul' := fun x y =>
        Subtype.ext <| by simp only [Subalgebra.coe_mul, map_mul, Subtype.coe_mk] }

/-- A ring equivalence between the integral closure of the valuation subring of `K` in `L`
  and a ring `R` satisfying `isIntegralClosure R v.valuationSubring L`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/AlgebraInstances/Variantdc31a241fb31233c8c59ebab6a5db4cd3e5f69fa812ca05c0117541c54f4fc83.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/AlgebraInstances/Variantdc31a241fb31233c8c59ebab6a5db4cd3e5f69fa812ca05c0117541c54f4fc83.lean#L56).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e3a9d823541a92e04b9d2667e81a241ee1b11aa6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
