## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a5813246-15fc-389b-23ff-9547836b23f2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 168–185.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    nth_prime_gap n ≤ 1476 := by

  obtain ⟨m, hm₁, hm₂, hm₃⟩ := exists_prime_gap_record_le n
  exact hm₂.trans <| h _ <|
    table_8_prime_gap_complete _ _ (hm₁.trans hp) hm₃

  (title := "Table 9 prime gaps - unit test")
  (statement := /--
  For every pair $(g,P)$ in Table 9 with $P < 30$, $P$ is
  the first prime producing the prime gap $g$, and all
  smaller $g'$ (that are even or $1$) have a smaller first
  prime. -/)
  (proof := /-- Direct computation. -/)
  (latexEnv := "proposition")
  (discussion := 903)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/ESHP/Variant3e6f9d29d87abae7648af9122ce5e995fcc45dbbfa17d1dcc56d612ba04c756a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/ESHP/Variant3e6f9d29d87abae7648af9122ce5e995fcc45dbbfa17d1dcc56d612ba04c756a.lean#L168).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `21ceaf279b9771b68f9aa5184d964814d97bd5f8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
