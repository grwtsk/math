## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f5e595e5-db70-87ef-ebab-e42cb9e441a8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem liftOfDerivationToSquareZero_mk_apply' (d : Derivation R A I) (x : A) :
    (Ideal.Quotient.mk I) (d x) + (algebraMap A (B ⧸ I)) x = algebraMap A (B ⧸ I) x := by
  simp only [Ideal.Quotient.eq_zero_iff_mem.mpr (d x).prop, zero_add]

/-- Given a tower of algebras `R → A → B`, and a square-zero `I : ideal B`,
there is a 1-1 correspondence between `R`-derivations from `A` to `I` and
lifts `A →ₐ[R] B` of the canonical map `A →ₐ[R] B ⧸ I`. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/ToSquareZero/Variant16a4d787901f7547036d9f61a03bf8e1e8fc4fe5a8af6623010df91fdbf8afca.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/ToSquareZero/Variant16a4d787901f7547036d9f61a03bf8e1e8fc4fe5a8af6623010df91fdbf8afca.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93bcf96edf85b34ad5a0c3c534fc49c78e32bf53` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
