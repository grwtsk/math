## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:26bdef5d4f8fb75ee87941baaa2ce6282de5d7e1c0459920421b5c46bb2a0dfc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 115–122.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) toOrderedCommSemiring : OrderedCommSemiring α :=
  { ‹CanonicallyOrderedCommSemiring α› with
    zero_le_one := zero_le _,
    mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left := fun a b c h _ => mul_le_mul_left' h _,
    mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right := fun a b c h _ => mul_le_mul_right' h _ }
#align canonically_ordered_comm_semiring.to_ordered_comm_semiring CanonicallyOrderedCommSemiring.toOrderedCommSemiring

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Canonical/Variant21f02ea018530e44101cb08675d747bb33fb15318f9c15ba477b9d4c7144a4a3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Canonical/Variant21f02ea018530e44101cb08675d747bb33fb15318f9c15ba477b9d4c7144a4a3.lean#L115).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `426ce4ec8bccffe61f3e258bd115f2a86733f594` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
