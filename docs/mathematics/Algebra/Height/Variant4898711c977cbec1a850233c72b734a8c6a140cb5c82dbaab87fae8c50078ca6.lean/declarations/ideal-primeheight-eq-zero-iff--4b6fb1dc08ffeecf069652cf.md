## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f01fab97-1646-44fd-e9e3-477eb9338519`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 168–179.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Ideal.primeHeight_eq_zero_iff {I : Ideal R} [I.IsPrime] :
    primeHeight I = 0 ↔ I ∈ minimalPrimes R := by
  rw [Ideal.primeHeight, Order.height_eq_zero, minimalPrimes, Ideal.minimalPrimes]
  simp only [bot_le, and_true, Set.mem_setOf_eq, Minimal, IsMin]

  · intro h
    by_contra! h'
    obtain ⟨P, ⟨hP₁, ⟨hP₂, hP₃⟩⟩⟩ := h' (inferInstance)
    exact hP₃ (h (b := ⟨P, hP₁⟩) hP₂)
  · rintro ⟨hI, hI'⟩ b hb
    exact hI' (y := b.asIdeal) b.isPrime hb

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Height/Variant4898711c977cbec1a850233c72b734a8c6a140cb5c82dbaab87fae8c50078ca6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Height/Variant4898711c977cbec1a850233c72b734a8c6a140cb5c82dbaab87fae8c50078ca6.lean#L168).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5873b3760959bf00a6985da1f95a2c16cf798709` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
