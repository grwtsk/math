## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5e23f8e6-2fb1-c653-f80d-b4266eaa924e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 193–217.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (diagonal w).rank = Fintype.card {i // (w i) ≠ 0} := by
  rw [Matrix.rank, ← Matrix.toLin'_apply', FiniteDimensional.finrank, ← LinearMap.rank,
    LinearMap.rank_diagonal, Cardinal.toNat_cast]

/-! ### Lemmas about transpose and conjugate transpose

This section contains lemmas about the rank of `Matrix.transpose` and `Matrix.conjTranspose`.

Unfortunately the proofs are essentially duplicated between the two; `ℚ` is a linearly-ordered ring
but can't be a star-ordered ring, while `ℂ` is star-ordered (with `open ComplexOrder`) but
not linearly ordered. For now we don't prove the transpose case for `ℂ`.

TODO: the lemmas `Matrix.rank_transpose` and `Matrix.rank_conjTranspose` current follow a short
proof that is a simple consequence of `Matrix.rank_transpose_mul_self` and
`Matrix.rank_conjTranspose_mul_self`. This proof pulls in unnecessary assumptions on `R`, and should
be replaced with a proof that uses Gaussian reduction or argues via linear combinations.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Rank/Variant9830e0344c743483b3ce90fa1ed04a533f0cfae2c62cb82feba6bdfbbb3489d5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Rank/Variant9830e0344c743483b3ce90fa1ed04a533f0cfae2c62cb82feba6bdfbbb3489d5.lean#L193).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `18d1c42d30c8cc81e072260f5d9af103521134d7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
