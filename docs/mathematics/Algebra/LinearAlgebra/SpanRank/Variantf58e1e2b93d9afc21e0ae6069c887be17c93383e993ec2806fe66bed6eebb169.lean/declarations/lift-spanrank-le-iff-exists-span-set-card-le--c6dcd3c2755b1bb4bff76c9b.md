## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:baf72457-58e7-68a7-d93b-579acf7d9ff3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 208–217.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma lift_spanRank_le_iff_exists_span_set_card_le (p : Submodule R M) {a : Cardinal.{max u v}} :
    Cardinal.lift.{v} p.spanRank ≤ a ↔ ∃ s : Set M, Cardinal.lift.{v} #s ≤ a ∧ span R s = p := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    obtain ⟨s, ⟨hs₁, hs₂⟩⟩ := exists_span_set_card_eq_spanRank p
    exact ⟨s, ⟨hs₁ ▸ h, hs₂⟩⟩
  · exact fun ⟨s, ⟨h₁, h₂⟩⟩ ↦ h₂.symm ▸ (Cardinal.lift_le.mpr (spanRank_span_le_card s)).trans h₁

/-- For a finitely generated submodule, its spanRank is less than or equal to a cardinal `a`
  if and only if there is a generating subset with cardinality less than or equal to `a`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SpanRank/Variantf58e1e2b93d9afc21e0ae6069c887be17c93383e993ec2806fe66bed6eebb169.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SpanRank/Variantf58e1e2b93d9afc21e0ae6069c887be17c93383e993ec2806fe66bed6eebb169.lean#L208).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `712209238faaaa1f7a4e5a77cc3ef70b9cf2d6f9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
