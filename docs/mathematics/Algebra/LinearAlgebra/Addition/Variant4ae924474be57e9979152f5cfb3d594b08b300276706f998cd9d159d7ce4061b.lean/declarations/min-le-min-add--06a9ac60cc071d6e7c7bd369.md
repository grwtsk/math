## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1bc0aeeb-5162-275b-850f-8c30c8cc8db7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 152–159.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem min_le_min_add {Γ} [LinearOrder Γ] {x y : HahnSeries Γ R} (hx : x ≠ 0)
    (hy : y ≠ 0) (hxy : x + y ≠ 0) :
    min (Set.IsWF.min x.isWF_support (support_nonempty_iff.2 hx))
      (Set.IsWF.min y.isWF_support (support_nonempty_iff.2 hy)) ≤
      Set.IsWF.min (x + y).isWF_support (support_nonempty_iff.2 hxy) := by
  rw [← Set.IsWF.min_union]
  exact Set.IsWF.min_le_min_of_subset (support_add_subset (x := x) (y := y))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Addition/Variant4ae924474be57e9979152f5cfb3d594b08b300276706f998cd9d159d7ce4061b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Addition/Variant4ae924474be57e9979152f5cfb3d594b08b300276706f998cd9d159d7ce4061b.lean#L152).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9dbda9566542d94895f87dc69c0c0fef4d55ea13` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
