## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3b097133-902c-f070-a321-d23bb98bc5dd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 76–83.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem orderTop_smul_not_lt (r : R) (x : V⟦Γ⟧) : ¬ (r • x).orderTop < x.orderTop := by
  by_cases hrx : r • x = 0
  · rw [hrx, orderTop_zero]
    exact not_top_lt
  · simp only [orderTop_of_ne_zero hrx, orderTop_of_ne_zero <| right_ne_zero_of_smul hrx,
      WithTop.coe_lt_coe]
    exact Set.IsWF.min_of_subset_not_lt_min (Function.support_smul_subset_right ..)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Addition/Variant2e9a191519a14d2ad56fcbd06aeae4dd0f556ea83a52287f133037648f27a8c8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Addition/Variant2e9a191519a14d2ad56fcbd06aeae4dd0f556ea83a52287f133037648f27a8c8.lean#L76).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `18df37a1959f44e5f27f35dca1f2d12e49049f71` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
