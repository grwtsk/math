## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:822c1866a71ac62ec966b0cb5e4b9afc5f2cd03cd88ceb8537ddea8e6d055a4a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 179–187.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def quotientQuotientEquivQuotient : ((M ⧸ S) ⧸ T.map S.mkQ) ≃ₗ[R] M ⧸ T :=
  { quotientQuotientEquivQuotientAux S T h with
    toFun := quotientQuotientEquivQuotientAux S T h
    invFun := mapQ _ _ (mkQ S) (le_comap_map _ _)
    left_inv := fun x => Quotient.inductionOn' x fun x => Quotient.inductionOn' x fun x => by simp
    right_inv := fun x => Quotient.inductionOn' x fun x => by simp }
#align submodule.quotient_quotient_equiv_quotient Submodule.quotientQuotientEquivQuotient

/-- Corollary of the third isomorphism theorem: `[S : T] [M : S] = [M : T]` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Isomorphisms/Variant184646388a199e08fe2c9fbd2f0f7af1227c0995c17bb51c9c2fc2761d2f699b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Isomorphisms/Variant184646388a199e08fe2c9fbd2f0f7af1227c0995c17bb51c9c2fc2761d2f699b.lean#L179).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ffd4f3fabb0eabe06bdc324835b48abed22c2dc2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
