## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5c497e9e-d8a8-224a-d2a4-01c08b6ea756`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 243–254.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dualTensorHom_bijective_of_comp_eq_id_right (f : N →ₗ[R] P) (g : P →ₗ[R] N)
    (comp_eq_id : g ∘ₗ f = .id) (h : Function.Bijective (dualTensorHom R M P)) :
    Function.Bijective (dualTensorHom R M N) where
  left := .of_comp (f := f.compRight R) <| by
    rw [← coe_comp, ← dualTensorHom_comp_lTensor]
    refine h.1.comp (injective_of_comp_eq_id _ (g.lTensor _) ?_)
    rw [← lTensor_comp, comp_eq_id, lTensor_id]
  right := .of_comp (g := g.lTensor _) <| by
    rw [← coe_comp, dualTensorHom_comp_lTensor, coe_comp]
    refine (surjective_of_comp_eq_id (f.compRight R) _ ?_).comp h.2
    ext; exact congr($comp_eq_id _)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Contraction/Variantd3f1c3ec7bda8c73bcb361bb28467f607d513911c8c2e67a96def3a4fa6701b0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Contraction/Variantd3f1c3ec7bda8c73bcb361bb28467f607d513911c8c2e67a96def3a4fa6701b0.lean#L243).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `db5a82030de808236dbf310af5c2ed4a0f46c4bb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
