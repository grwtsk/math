## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:65fa0bb5-01a6-d7fa-1f70-fb812a401ab6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 402–423.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    homTensorHomEquiv R M N P Q x = homTensorHomMap (.id R) M N P Q x := rfl

end CommSemiring

end HomTensorHom

variable [CommSemiring R] [AddCommMonoid M] [AddCommMonoid N] [Module R M] [Module R N]

section
variable [Module.Finite R M] [Module.Finite R N] [Projective R M] [Projective R N]

variable (R M N) in
/-- A linear equivalence between `Dual M ⊗ Dual N` and `Dual (M ⊗ N)` when `M` and `N` are finite
projective modules. It sends `f ⊗ g` to the composition of `TensorProduct.map f g` with the natural
isomorphism `R ⊗ R ≃ R`.

Note that `dualDistribEquiv` is not defined directly in terms of `dualDistri`, but the
equivalence between the two is given by `toLinearMap_dualDistribEquiv` and
`dualDistribEquiv_tmul_tmul`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Contraction/Variantd3f1c3ec7bda8c73bcb361bb28467f607d513911c8c2e67a96def3a4fa6701b0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Contraction/Variantd3f1c3ec7bda8c73bcb361bb28467f607d513911c8c2e67a96def3a4fa6701b0.lean#L402).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `db5a82030de808236dbf310af5c2ed4a0f46c4bb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
