## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e3db16f8-da4a-f124-5584-9595f72188b1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 147–152.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem contractRight_mul_ι (a : M) (b : CliffordAlgebra Q) :
    b * ι Q a⌊d = d a • b - b⌊d * ι Q a := by
  rw [contractRight_eq, reverse.map_mul, reverse_ι, contractLeft_ι_mul, map_sub, map_smul,
    reverse_reverse, reverse.map_mul, reverse_ι, contractRight_eq]
#align clifford_algebra.contract_right_mul_ι CliffordAlgebra.contractRight_mul_ι

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Contraction/Variant9f838193cbbc79482959a0c4f671e8066f78eb2644120a723857a53f283fde1c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Contraction/Variant9f838193cbbc79482959a0c4f671e8066f78eb2644120a723857a53f283fde1c.lean#L147).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b7124df1bb575a257c67b24294ca91a4d3242a8d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
