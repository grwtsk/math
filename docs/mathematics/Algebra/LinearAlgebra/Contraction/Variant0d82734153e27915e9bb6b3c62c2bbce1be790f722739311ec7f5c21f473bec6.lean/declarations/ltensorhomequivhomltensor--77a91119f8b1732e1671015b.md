## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a96e8b7ee3bb935c201c10d0f40f3c5b318f9e50232221e3a2abcb7e8bc0ec17`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 200–208.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def lTensorHomEquivHomLTensor : P ⊗[R] (M →ₗ[R] Q) ≃ₗ[R] M →ₗ[R] P ⊗[R] Q :=
  congr (LinearEquiv.refl R P) (dualTensorHomEquiv R M Q).symm ≪≫ₗ
      TensorProduct.leftComm R P _ Q ≪≫ₗ
    dualTensorHomEquiv R M _

/-- When `M` is a finite free module, the map `rTensorHomToHomRTensor` is an equivalence. Note
that `rTensorHomEquivHomRTensor` is not defined directly in terms of
`rTensorHomToHomRTensor`, but the equivalence between the two is given by
`rTensorHomEquivHomRTensor_toLinearMap` and `rTensorHomEquivHomRTensor_apply`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Contraction/Variant0d82734153e27915e9bb6b3c62c2bbce1be790f722739311ec7f5c21f473bec6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Contraction/Variant0d82734153e27915e9bb6b3c62c2bbce1be790f722739311ec7f5c21f473bec6.lean#L200).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `965eb182c752b89837bcef4648c0ad893ffd2bae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
