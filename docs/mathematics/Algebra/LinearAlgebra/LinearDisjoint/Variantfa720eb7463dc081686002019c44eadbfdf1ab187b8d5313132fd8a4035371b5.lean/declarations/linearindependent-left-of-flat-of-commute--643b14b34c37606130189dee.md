## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:49b48c0f-12b1-e896-27d5-663fbdaf9012`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 358–364.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem linearIndependent_left_of_flat_of_commute (H : A.LinearDisjoint B) [Module.Flat R B]
    {ι : Type*} {a : ι → A} (ha : LinearIndependent R a)
    (hc : ∀ (a : A) (b : B), Commute a.1 b.1) : LinearIndependent B (A.val ∘ a) :=
  (H.symm_of_commute hc).linearIndependent_right_of_flat ha

/-- If a basis of `A` is also `B`-linearly independent, if elements in `A` and `B` commute,
then `A` and `B` are linearly disjoint. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearDisjoint/Variantfa720eb7463dc081686002019c44eadbfdf1ab187b8d5313132fd8a4035371b5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearDisjoint/Variantfa720eb7463dc081686002019c44eadbfdf1ab187b8d5313132fd8a4035371b5.lean#L358).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `85213be5bb216bae650938535c70ffc17d762a1d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
