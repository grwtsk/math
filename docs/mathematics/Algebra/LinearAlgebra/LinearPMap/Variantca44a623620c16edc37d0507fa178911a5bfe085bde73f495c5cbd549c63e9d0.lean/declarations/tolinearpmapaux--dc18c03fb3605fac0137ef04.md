## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b1270b02e86b4f42c17dbbe049d6034b83d5b4cb6e0db2a23c168ead5066a6a1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 913–934.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def toLinearPMapAux (g : Submodule R (E × F))
    (hg : ∀ (x : E × F) (_hx : x ∈ g) (_hx' : x.fst = 0), x.snd = 0) :
    g.map (LinearMap.fst R E F) →ₗ[R] F where
  toFun := fun x => valFromGraph hg x.2
  map_add' := fun v w => by
    have hadd := (g.map (LinearMap.fst R E F)).add_mem v.2 w.2
    have hvw := valFromGraph_mem hg hadd
    have hvw' := g.add_mem (valFromGraph_mem hg v.2) (valFromGraph_mem hg w.2)
    rw [Prod.mk_add_mk] at hvw'
    exact (existsUnique_from_graph @hg hadd).unique hvw hvw'
  map_smul' := fun a v => by
    have hsmul := (g.map (LinearMap.fst R E F)).smul_mem a v.2
    have hav := valFromGraph_mem hg hsmul
    have hav' := g.smul_mem a (valFromGraph_mem hg v.2)

In the case that the submodule is not a graph of a `LinearPMap` then the underlying linear map
is just the zero map. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearPMap/Variantca44a623620c16edc37d0507fa178911a5bfe085bde73f495c5cbd549c63e9d0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearPMap/Variantca44a623620c16edc37d0507fa178911a5bfe085bde73f495c5cbd549c63e9d0.lean#L913).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `177776ef55055397436abf880aa7fbb25c2ebed3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
