## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:42df264c-968a-524e-708e-d4ba32a408e2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 870–877.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_graph_snd_inj' (f : E →ₗ.[R] F) {x y : E × F} (hx : x ∈ f.graph) (hy : y ∈ f.graph)
    (hxy : x.1 = y.1) : x.2 = y.2 := by
  cases x
  cases y
  exact f.mem_graph_snd_inj hx hy hxy
#align linear_pmap.mem_graph_snd_inj' LinearPMap.mem_graph_snd_inj'

/-- The property that `f 0 = 0` in terms of the graph. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearPMap/Variant212dce61178caade740cee8502eaa869da90bf0512f9b00e1e547ea64b924b2b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearPMap/Variant212dce61178caade740cee8502eaa869da90bf0512f9b00e1e547ea64b924b2b.lean#L870).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `62280ddd0ffc9cc68fd3d730c4b8cb77493dfa9e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
