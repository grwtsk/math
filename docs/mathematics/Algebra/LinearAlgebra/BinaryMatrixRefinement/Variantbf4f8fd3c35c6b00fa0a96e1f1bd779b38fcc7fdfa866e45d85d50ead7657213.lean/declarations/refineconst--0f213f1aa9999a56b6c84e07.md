## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3a61b7e2bf3e3ab0e23c13f43a77d60bc5d1304b9c6bf66b578a2eae59d9dcb6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 139–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def refineConst
    (q : Nat)
    (hq : 0 < q)
    (M : Carrier.BinaryMatrix) : Carrier.BinaryMatrix :=
  refineMatrix (constRefinementRule q hq) M

/--
Top-left binary zoom-out from a refined matrix back to a chosen coarse shape.

This is an exact binary zoom-out only for constant blocks.  Nonconstant blocks
belong to the analytic renormalization layer.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/BinaryMatrixRefinement/Variantbf4f8fd3c35c6b00fa0a96e1f1bd779b38fcc7fdfa866e45d85d50ead7657213.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/BinaryMatrixRefinement/Variantbf4f8fd3c35c6b00fa0a96e1f1bd779b38fcc7fdfa866e45d85d50ead7657213.lean#L139).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e2605988f6decd246b07acaaf5d27ad193dafb23` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
