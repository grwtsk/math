## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0000b29c-46da-8c7a-b109-e3e4f162ca2b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 489–492.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem kroneckerTMul_diagonal [DecidableEq n] (A : Matrix l m α) (b : n → α) :
    A ⊗ₖₜ[R] diagonal b = blockDiagonal fun i => A.map fun a => a ⊗ₜ[R] b i :=
  kroneckerMap_diagonal_right _ (tmul_zero _) _ _

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Kronecker/Variant0ff80e9e0555a8d3107c4b8ab16c3f0718b64183d5252f592238f3d6980d9ed7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Kronecker/Variant0ff80e9e0555a8d3107c4b8ab16c3f0718b64183d5252f592238f3d6980d9ed7.lean#L489).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d1fa7b7d4db2412d7429f8df6820d03d652dc307` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
