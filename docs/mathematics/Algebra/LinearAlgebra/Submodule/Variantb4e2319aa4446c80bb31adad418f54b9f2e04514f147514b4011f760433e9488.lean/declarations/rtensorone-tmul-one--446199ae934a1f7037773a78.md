## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:867c6d26-986c-f2e3-74aa-1eebf9a2caab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 217–223.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rTensorOne'_tmul_one (m : M) : M.rTensorOne' (m ⊗ₜ[R] 1) = m := by
  simpa using rTensorOne'_tmul 1 m

/-- If `M` is a submodule in an algebra `S` over `R`,
there is the natural isomorphism of `R`-modules between
`M ⊗[R] i(R)` and `M` induced by multiplication in `S`, here `i : R → S` is the structure map.
This generalizes `TensorProduct.rid` as `i(R)` is not necessarily isomorphic to `R`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Submodule/Variantb4e2319aa4446c80bb31adad418f54b9f2e04514f147514b4011f760433e9488.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Submodule/Variantb4e2319aa4446c80bb31adad418f54b9f2e04514f147514b4011f760433e9488.lean#L217).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2cb547eeef061fc233d7f4887f841336d9e93638` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
