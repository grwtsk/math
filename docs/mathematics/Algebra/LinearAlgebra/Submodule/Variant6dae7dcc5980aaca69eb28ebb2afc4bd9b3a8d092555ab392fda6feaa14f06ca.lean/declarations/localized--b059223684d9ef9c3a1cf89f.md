## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:378866034621f716a99a7f73bab6e3d896a7cae3eb9146adcf7fafd3ea78e529`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 42–52.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def localized₀ : Submodule R N where
  carrier := { x | ∃ m ∈ M', ∃ s : p, IsLocalizedModule.mk' f m s = x }
  add_mem' := fun {x y} ⟨m, hm, s, hx⟩ ⟨n, hn, t, hy⟩ ↦ ⟨t • m + s • n, add_mem (M'.smul_mem t hm)
    (M'.smul_mem s hn), s * t, by rw [← hx, ← hy, IsLocalizedModule.mk'_add_mk']⟩
  zero_mem' := ⟨0, zero_mem _, 1, by simp⟩
  smul_mem' r x := by
    rintro ⟨m, hm, s, hx⟩
    exact ⟨r • m, smul_mem M' _ hm, s, by rw [IsLocalizedModule.mk'_smul, hx]⟩

/-- Let `S` be the localization of `R` at `p` and `N` be a localization of `M` at `p`.
This is the localization of an `R`-submodule of `M` viewed as an `S`-submodule of `N`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Submodule/Variant6dae7dcc5980aaca69eb28ebb2afc4bd9b3a8d092555ab392fda6feaa14f06ca.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Submodule/Variant6dae7dcc5980aaca69eb28ebb2afc4bd9b3a8d092555ab392fda6feaa14f06ca.lean#L42).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `97b220523515c73ebc02b6e47a1e8b36070d02d5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
