## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:87e1a322-ca5e-c340-113b-961b55198dc4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 256–263.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem apply_eigenvectorBasis (i : Fin n) :
    T (hT.eigenvectorBasis hn i) = (hT.eigenvalues hn i : 𝕜) • hT.eigenvectorBasis hn i :=
  mem_eigenspace_iff.mp (hT.hasEigenvector_eigenvectorBasis hn i).1
#align linear_map.is_symmetric.apply_eigenvector_basis LinearMap.IsSymmetric.apply_eigenvectorBasis

/-- *Diagonalization theorem*, *spectral theorem*; version 2: A self-adjoint operator `T` on a
finite-dimensional inner product space `E` acts diagonally on the identification of `E` with
Euclidean space induced by an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of `T`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Spectrum/Variant87ffb19e08f863ef264fab5891fe84f60d94d67f479b5f921ec84f730ca9b323.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Spectrum/Variant87ffb19e08f863ef264fab5891fe84f60d94d67f479b5f921ec84f730ca9b323.lean#L256).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6c82b28ea10f6dff4c1d0bf6279278d442b66b01` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
