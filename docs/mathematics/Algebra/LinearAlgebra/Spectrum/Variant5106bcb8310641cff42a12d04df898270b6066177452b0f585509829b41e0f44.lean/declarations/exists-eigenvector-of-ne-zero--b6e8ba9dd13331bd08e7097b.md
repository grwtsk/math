## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8ace0883-4389-c540-a75f-b479569f0cfc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 236–247.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma exists_eigenvector_of_ne_zero (hA : IsHermitian A) (h_ne : A ≠ 0) :
    ∃ (v : n → 𝕜) (t : ℝ), t ≠ 0 ∧ v ≠ 0 ∧ A *ᵥ v = t • v := by
  classical
  have : hA.eigenvalues ≠ 0 := by
    contrapose h_ne
    have := hA.spectral_theorem
    rwa [h_ne, Pi.comp_zero, RCLike.ofReal_zero, (by rfl : Function.const n (0 : 𝕜) = fun _ ↦ 0),
      diagonal_zero, map_zero] at this
  obtain ⟨i, hi⟩ := Function.ne_iff.mp this
  exact ⟨_, _, hi, (ofLp_eq_zero 2).ne.2 <| hA.eigenvectorBasis.orthonormal.ne_zero i,
    hA.mulVec_eigenvectorBasis i⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Spectrum/Variant5106bcb8310641cff42a12d04df898270b6066177452b0f585509829b41e0f44.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Spectrum/Variant5106bcb8310641cff42a12d04df898270b6066177452b0f585509829b41e0f44.lean#L236).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d099425d172b3dc3b703d8db4244803ec590d509` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
