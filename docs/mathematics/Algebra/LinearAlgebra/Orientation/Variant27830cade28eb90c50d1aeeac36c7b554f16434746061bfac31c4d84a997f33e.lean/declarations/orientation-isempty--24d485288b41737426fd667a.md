## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5ba42e4e-e5eb-c6b4-1663-597522e38892`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 181–201.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem orientation_isEmpty [IsEmpty ι] (b : Basis ι R M) :
    b.orientation = positiveOrientation := by
  rw [Basis.orientation]
  congr
  exact b.det_isEmpty

end Basis

end OrderedCommRing

section LinearOrderedCommRing

variable {R : Type*} [CommRing R] [LinearOrder R] [IsStrictOrderedRing R]
variable {M : Type*} [AddCommGroup M] [Module R M]
variable {ι : Type*}

namespace Orientation

/-- A module `M` over a linearly ordered commutative ring has precisely two "orientations" with
respect to an empty index type. (Note that these are only orientations of `M` of in the conventional
mathematical sense if `M` is zero-dimensional.) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Orientation/Variant27830cade28eb90c50d1aeeac36c7b554f16434746061bfac31c4d84a997f33e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Orientation/Variant27830cade28eb90c50d1aeeac36c7b554f16434746061bfac31c4d84a997f33e.lean#L181).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b9e291f43dfd1b3c6efdf230d535908e477c505d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
