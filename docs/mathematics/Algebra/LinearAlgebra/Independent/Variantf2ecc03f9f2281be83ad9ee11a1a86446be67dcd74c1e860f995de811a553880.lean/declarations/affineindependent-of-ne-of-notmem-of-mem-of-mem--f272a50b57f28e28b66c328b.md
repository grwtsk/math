## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7bd8763c-f307-559a-c52e-4bd068bdf0ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 726–750.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Given an affinely independent family of points, suppose that an affine combination lies in
the span of two points given as affine combinations, and suppose that, for two indices, the
coefficients in the first point in the span are zero and those in the second point in the span
have the same sign. Then the coefficients in the combination lying in the span have the same
sign. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Independent/Variantf2ecc03f9f2281be83ad9ee11a1a86446be67dcd74c1e860f995de811a553880.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Independent/Variantf2ecc03f9f2281be83ad9ee11a1a86446be67dcd74c1e860f995de811a553880.lean#L726).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
