## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:72d556bd8261b92b68148fc26a850ef1c517fddab34470fe8093d9567ecb0960`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 561–572.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def sndEquiv : Submodule.snd R M M₂ ≃ₗ[R] M₂ where
  -- Porting note: proofs were `tidy` or `simp`
  toFun x := x.1.2
  invFun n := ⟨⟨0, n⟩, by simp [snd]⟩
  map_add' := by simp
  map_smul' := by simp
  left_inv := by
    rintro ⟨⟨x, y⟩, hx⟩
    simp only [snd, comap_bot, mem_ker, fst_apply] at hx
    simpa only [Subtype.mk.injEq, Prod.mk.injEq, and_true] using hx.symm
  right_inv := by rintro x; rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Prod/Variantcd1a4b14f27eb8b4ddd1ac832de74d36a20af381922c32b31eedc8ff62c7d0d8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Prod/Variantcd1a4b14f27eb8b4ddd1ac832de74d36a20af381922c32b31eedc8ff62c7d0d8.lean#L561).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9eb725e8ffaff98a90c1b777aa46ef69320aa54e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
