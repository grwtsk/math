## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:22b8d0ea1525f82e6cffd0953cb133b8e0869cd3405f285b02bb295eacf4dbc1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 352–359.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def prodMapLinear [Module S M₃] [Module S M₄] [SMulCommClass R S M₃] [SMulCommClass R S M₄] :
    (M →ₗ[R] M₃) × (M₂ →ₗ[R] M₄) →ₗ[S] M × M₂ →ₗ[R] M₃ × M₄ where
  toFun f := prodMap f.1 f.2
  map_add' _ _ := rfl
  map_smul' _ _ := rfl

/-- `LinearMap.prodMap` as a `RingHom` -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Prod/Variant1a0207908dbaf262cbcb311e6a2480494d1ea5a250fb4959b34bacf5fe38fddd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Prod/Variant1a0207908dbaf262cbcb311e6a2480494d1ea5a250fb4959b34bacf5fe38fddd.lean#L352).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f4a36aed6c9fdedfb795a22c512c5e78668fe2a8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
