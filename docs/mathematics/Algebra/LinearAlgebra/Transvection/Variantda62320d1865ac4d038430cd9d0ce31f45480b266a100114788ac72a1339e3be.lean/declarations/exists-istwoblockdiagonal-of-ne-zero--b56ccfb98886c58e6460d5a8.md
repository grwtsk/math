## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:621bc7b7-3c8c-16f7-d7f4-59b00e3e2c11`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 538–554.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem exists_isTwoBlockDiagonal_of_ne_zero (hM : M (inr unit) (inr unit) ≠ 0) :
    ∃ L L' : List (TransvectionStruct (Fin r ⊕ Unit) 𝕜),
      IsTwoBlockDiagonal ((L.map toMatrix).prod * M * (L'.map toMatrix).prod) := by
  let L : List (TransvectionStruct (Fin r ⊕ Unit) 𝕜) :=
    List.ofFn fun i : Fin r =>
      ⟨inl i, inr unit, by simp, -M (inl i) (inr unit) / M (inr unit) (inr unit)⟩
  let L' : List (TransvectionStruct (Fin r ⊕ Unit) 𝕜) :=
    List.ofFn fun i : Fin r =>
      ⟨inr unit, inl i, by simp, -M (inr unit) (inl i) / M (inr unit) (inr unit)⟩

  have A : L.map toMatrix = listTransvecCol M := by simp [L, listTransvecCol, Function.comp_def]
  have B : L'.map toMatrix = listTransvecRow M := by simp [L', listTransvecRow, Function.comp_def]

/-- There exist two lists of `TransvectionStruct` such that multiplying by them on the left and
on the right makes a matrix block-diagonal. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Transvection/Variantda62320d1865ac4d038430cd9d0ce31f45480b266a100114788ac72a1339e3be.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Transvection/Variantda62320d1865ac4d038430cd9d0ce31f45480b266a100114788ac72a1339e3be.lean#L538).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `851347c72252710a76c813eb44f1d73c3eb541bb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
