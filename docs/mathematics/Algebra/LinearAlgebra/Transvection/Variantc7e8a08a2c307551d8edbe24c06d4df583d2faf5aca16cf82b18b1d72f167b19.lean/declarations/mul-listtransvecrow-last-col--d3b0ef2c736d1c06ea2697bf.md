## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:17a2d1fc-c0cf-ee12-f03a-d683cbdcafea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 450–458.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mul_listTransvecRow_last_col (i : Sum (Fin r) Unit) :
    (M * (listTransvecRow M).prod) i (inr unit) = M i (inr unit) := by
  have A : (listTransvecRow M).length = r := by simp [listTransvecRow]
  rw [← List.take_length (listTransvecRow M), A]
  simpa using mul_listTransvecRow_last_col_take M i le_rfl
#align matrix.pivot.mul_list_transvec_row_last_col Matrix.Pivot.mul_listTransvecRow_last_col

/-- Multiplying by all the matrices in `listTransvecRow M` kills all the coefficients in the
last row but the last one. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Transvection/Variantc7e8a08a2c307551d8edbe24c06d4df583d2faf5aca16cf82b18b1d72f167b19.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Transvection/Variantc7e8a08a2c307551d8edbe24c06d4df583d2faf5aca16cf82b18b1d72f167b19.lean#L450).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `988de09fad2e152432ddd4bf1e6f388f5e904ce2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
