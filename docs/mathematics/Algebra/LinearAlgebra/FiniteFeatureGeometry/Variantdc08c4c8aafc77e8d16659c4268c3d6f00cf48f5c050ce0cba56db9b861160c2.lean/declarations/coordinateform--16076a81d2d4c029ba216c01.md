## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:60940b08994fd05156beb3a2539dc923096449fefcf3592548f4c93aee0e7025`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 33–56.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def coordinateForm (weight : I → ℝ) (hw : ∀ i, 0 ≤ weight i) :
    PositiveForm (I → ℝ) where
  form x y := ∑ i, weight i * (x i * y i)
  add_left x y z := by
    simp only [Pi.add_apply, add_mul, mul_add, Finset.sum_add_distrib]
  smul_left a x y := by
    simp only [Pi.smul_apply, smul_eq_mul, Finset.mul_sum]
    apply Finset.sum_congr rfl
    intro i _
    ring
  add_right x y z := by
    simp only [Pi.add_apply, mul_add, Finset.sum_add_distrib]
  smul_right a x y := by
    simp only [Pi.smul_apply, smul_eq_mul, Finset.mul_sum]
    apply Finset.sum_congr rfl
    intro i _
    ring
  symmetric x y := by
    apply Finset.sum_congr rfl
    intro i _
    rw [mul_comm (x i) (y i)]
  nonnegative x := Finset.sum_nonneg fun i _ => mul_nonneg (hw i) (mul_self_nonneg (x i))

/-- A strictly positively weighted coordinate vector is null exactly when it is zero. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/FiniteFeatureGeometry/Variantdc08c4c8aafc77e8d16659c4268c3d6f00cf48f5c050ce0cba56db9b861160c2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/FiniteFeatureGeometry/Variantdc08c4c8aafc77e8d16659c4268c3d6f00cf48f5c050ce0cba56db9b861160c2.lean#L33).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b07157ef276b598f2706b39a3cede03555927b3a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
