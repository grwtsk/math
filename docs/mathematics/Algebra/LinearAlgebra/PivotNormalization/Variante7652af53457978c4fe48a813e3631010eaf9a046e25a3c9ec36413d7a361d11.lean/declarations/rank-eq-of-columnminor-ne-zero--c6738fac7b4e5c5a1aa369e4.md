## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:be0db49d-4a04-e720-b0a0-168e2494d692`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 224–233.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rank_eq_of_columnMinor_ne_zero (A : Matrix (Fin k) (Fin n) ℝ)
    (c : Fin k → Fin n) (hc : columnMinor A c ≠ 0) : A.rank = k := by
  apply le_antisymm (Matrix.rank_le_height A)
  have hp : (columnSubmatrix A c).rank = k := by
    simpa only [Fintype.card_fin] using
      (Matrix.rank_of_det_ne_zero (A := columnSubmatrix A c) hc)
  have hs : (columnSubmatrix A c).rank ≤ A.rank := Matrix.rank_submatrix_le A id c
  exact hp.symm.trans_le hs

/-- The real row subspace has exactly the certified pivot dimension. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PivotNormalization/Variante7652af53457978c4fe48a813e3631010eaf9a046e25a3c9ec36413d7a361d11.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PivotNormalization/Variante7652af53457978c4fe48a813e3631010eaf9a046e25a3c9ec36413d7a361d11.lean#L224).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `02e65aa6a444d1c9812daf74a50541da0cf65dfa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
