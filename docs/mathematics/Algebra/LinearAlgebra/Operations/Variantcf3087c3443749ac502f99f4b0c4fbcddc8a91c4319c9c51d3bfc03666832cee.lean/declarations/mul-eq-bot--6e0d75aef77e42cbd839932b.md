## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dfea6ad9-8e6e-b692-1fea-895c85187053`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 260–268.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mul_eq_bot [NoZeroDivisors A] {M N : Submodule R A} :
    M * N = ⊥ ↔ M = ⊥ ∨ N = ⊥ :=
  ⟨fun hmn =>
    or_iff_not_imp_left.mpr fun M_ne_bot =>
      N.eq_bot_iff.mpr fun n hn =>
        let ⟨m, hm, ne0⟩ := M.ne_bot_iff.mp M_ne_bot
        Or.resolve_left (mul_eq_zero.mp ((M * N).eq_bot_iff.mp hmn _ (mul_mem_mul hm hn))) ne0,
    fun h => by obtain rfl | rfl := h; exacts [bot_mul _, mul_bot _]⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Operations/Variantcf3087c3443749ac502f99f4b0c4fbcddc8a91c4319c9c51d3bfc03666832cee.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Operations/Variantcf3087c3443749ac502f99f4b0c4fbcddc8a91c4319c9c51d3bfc03666832cee.lean#L260).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cc3ae876f44a002be9803a5018be97525447f69b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
