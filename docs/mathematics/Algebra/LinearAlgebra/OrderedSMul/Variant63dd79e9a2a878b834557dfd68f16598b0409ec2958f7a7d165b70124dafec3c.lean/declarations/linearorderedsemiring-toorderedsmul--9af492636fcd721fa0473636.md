## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4867564b69c734a3bb2c1f9b58736f3b2ee68148590508771c40302adf3573f5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 103–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance LinearOrderedSemiring.toOrderedSMul : OrderedSMul R R :=
  OrderedSMul.mk'' fun _ => strictMono_mul_left_of_pos

end LinearOrderedSemiring

section LinearOrderedSemifield

variable [Semifield 𝕜] [LinearOrder 𝕜] [IsStrictOrderedRing 𝕜]
  [AddCommMonoid M] [PartialOrder M]
  [AddCommMonoid N] [PartialOrder N]
  [MulActionWithZero 𝕜 M] [MulActionWithZero 𝕜 N]

/-- To prove that a vector space over a linear ordered field is ordered, it suffices to verify only
the first axiom of `OrderedSMul`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/OrderedSMul/Variant63dd79e9a2a878b834557dfd68f16598b0409ec2958f7a7d165b70124dafec3c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/OrderedSMul/Variant63dd79e9a2a878b834557dfd68f16598b0409ec2958f7a7d165b70124dafec3c.lean#L103).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e9ed9c6ae68c55f380b745c8d81ea32547cf5643` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
