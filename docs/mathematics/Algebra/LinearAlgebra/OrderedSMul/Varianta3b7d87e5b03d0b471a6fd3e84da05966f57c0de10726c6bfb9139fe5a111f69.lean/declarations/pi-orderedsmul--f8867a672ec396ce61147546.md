## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:275866c3ce210fce47349fce59fb99a0e062d556fc35e38d0c74bcc03ad9ded0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 141–151.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Pi.orderedSMul {M : ι → Type*} [∀ i, AddCommMonoid (M i)] [∀ i, PartialOrder (M i)]
    [∀ i, MulActionWithZero 𝕜 (M i)] [∀ i, OrderedSMul 𝕜 (M i)] : OrderedSMul 𝕜 (∀ i, M i) :=
  OrderedSMul.mk' fun _ _ _ h hc i => smul_le_smul_of_nonneg_left (h.le i) hc.le

end LinearOrderedSemifield

section Invertible
variable (α : Type*) {β : Type*}
variable [Semiring α] [Invertible (2 : α)] [Lattice β] [AddCommGroup β] [Module α β]
  [AddLeftMono β]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/OrderedSMul/Varianta3b7d87e5b03d0b471a6fd3e84da05966f57c0de10726c6bfb9139fe5a111f69.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/OrderedSMul/Varianta3b7d87e5b03d0b471a6fd3e84da05966f57c0de10726c6bfb9139fe5a111f69.lean#L141).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `48f1317cd399984e84e6a4ebd5fadfbb304ed874` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
