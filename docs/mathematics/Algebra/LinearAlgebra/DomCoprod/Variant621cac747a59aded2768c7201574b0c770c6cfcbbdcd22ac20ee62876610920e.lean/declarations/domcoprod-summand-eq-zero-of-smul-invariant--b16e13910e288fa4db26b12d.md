## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f61b9712-c68c-ac5a-e047-0e5b2fd76843`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–139.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    exact AlternatingMap.map_eq_zero_of_eq _ _ hv fun hij' => hij (hij' ▸ rfl)

    suffices (b fun i ↦ v (σ (Sum.inr i))) = 0 by simp_all
    exact b.map_eq_zero_of_eq _ hv fun hij' => hij (hij' ▸ rfl)

/-- Like `MultilinearMap.domCoprod`, but ensures the result is also alternating.

Note that this is usually defined (for instance, as used in Proposition 22.24 in [Gallier2011Notes])
over integer indices `ιa = Fin n` and `ιb = Fin m`, as
$$
(f \wedge g)(u_1, \ldots, u_{m+n}) =
  \sum_{\operatorname{shuffle}(m, n)} \operatorname{sign}(\sigma)
    f(u_{\sigma(1)}, \ldots, u_{\sigma(m)}) g(u_{\sigma(m+1)}, \ldots, u_{\sigma(m+n)}),
$$
where $\operatorname{shuffle}(m, n)$ consists of all permutations of $[1, m+n]$ such that
$\sigma(1) < \cdots < \sigma(m)$ and $\sigma(m+1) < \cdots < \sigma(m+n)$.

Here, we generalize this by replacing:
* the product in the sum with a tensor product
* the filtering of $[1, m+n]$ to shuffles with an isomorphic quotient
* the additions in the subscripts of $\sigma$ with an index of type `Sum`

The specialized version can be obtained by combining this definition with `finSumFinEquiv` and
`LinearMap.mul'`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/DomCoprod/Variant621cac747a59aded2768c7201574b0c770c6cfcbbdcd22ac20ee62876610920e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/DomCoprod/Variant621cac747a59aded2768c7201574b0c770c6cfcbbdcd22ac20ee62876610920e.lean#L97).
