## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:17322a419a8ec08b93cea322cfee2b43fcfd8de66ce9b8015ec05faa968dd6b1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 64–69.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def toSpanNonzeroSingleton (x : E) (h : x ≠ 0) : 𝕜 ≃L[𝕜] 𝕜 ∙ x :=
  ofHomothety (LinearEquiv.toSpanNonzeroSingleton 𝕜 E x h) ‖x‖ (norm_pos_iff.mpr h)
    (LinearEquiv.toSpanNonzeroSingleton_homothety 𝕜 x h)

/-- Given a nonzero element `x` of a normed space `E₁` over a field `𝕜`, the natural continuous
    linear map from the span of `x` to `𝕜`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Span/Variant546bd3abc8479dd84ea19a39b1e77baf14962188e53b6ed6b6d1bd6253311217.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Span/Variant546bd3abc8479dd84ea19a39b1e77baf14962188e53b6ed6b6d1bd6253311217.lean#L64).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2f350cc94a23630e4b261ea24217524d527df386` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
