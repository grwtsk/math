## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fea2b823-37b9-24b9-f5e4-ce94ea8271c7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1161–1168.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem le_of_span_le_span [Nontrivial R] {s t u : Set M} (hl : LinearIndependent R ((↑) : u → M))
    (hsu : s ⊆ u) (htu : t ⊆ u) (hst : span R s ≤ span R t) : s ⊆ t := by
  have :=
    eq_of_linearIndependent_of_span_subtype (hl.mono (Set.union_subset hsu htu))
      (Set.subset_union_right _ _) (Set.union_subset (Set.Subset.trans subset_span hst) subset_span)
  rw [← this]; apply Set.subset_union_left
#align le_of_span_le_span le_of_span_le_span

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearIndependent/Variant15a3f1d129ee46ce6217a9429779d7bcbdf491054b754fd11aa3149c7777d7be.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearIndependent/Variant15a3f1d129ee46ce6217a9429779d7bcbdf491054b754fd11aa3149c7777d7be.lean#L1161).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3624b387ea4062357a4d5b9465d82c958c5cb63a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
