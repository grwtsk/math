## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:383c8b55-4d48-718c-c6ea-e6ce486ae1bc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 220–238.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  | succ n ih =>

    ext <;> change _ = (0 : V n) <;> simp only <;> apply ih <;> intro p <;>
      [let q : Q n.succ := fun i => if h : i = 0 then true else p (i.pred h);
      let q : Q n.succ := fun i => if h : i = 0 then false else p (i.pred h)]

      | rw [ε, show q 0 = true from rfl, Bool.cond_true] at h
      | rw [ε, show q 0 = false from rfl, Bool.cond_false] at h
      rwa [show p = π q by ext; simp [q, Fin.succ_ne_zero, π]]

open Module

/-- `e` and `ε` are dual families of vectors. It implies that `e` is indeed a basis
and `ε` computes coefficients of decompositions of vectors on that basis. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Sensitivity/Variante4ef823d8b5e7688fcbb19e0624e5e35637f5a0d0f95a6e6aab13a60265788f8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Sensitivity/Variante4ef823d8b5e7688fcbb19e0624e5e35637f5a0d0f95a6e6aab13a60265788f8.lean#L220).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `21e1587b28267d52face7f025b7c3c6aaf89f6cf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
