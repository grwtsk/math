## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:faf3124ec7ed37de283292847e669c520617a292a317dd59c647409ad958cd94`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 187–194.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def decodeSelection : (N m : ℕ) → (Fin N ↪o Fin (N + m)) → Selection N m
  | 0, m, _ => ⟨0, OrderEmbedding.id _, emptySelection m⟩
  | n + 1, m, S =>
    if h : (S 0).val < n + 1 then
      liftSelection (firstPivot S h) (decodeSelection n m (deleteFirstColumns S))
    else ⟨n + 1, OrderEmbedding.id _, rightColumns S (all_right_of_first S h)⟩

/-- The first selected left column has exactly the signed-unit pattern. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SignedMinorElimination/Variantbde018f15737ab77817286e1eb446d88517aa7f3b5fc4fa235c4ee33ff15d127.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SignedMinorElimination/Variantbde018f15737ab77817286e1eb446d88517aa7f3b5fc4fa235c4ee33ff15d127.lean#L187).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f2b57501d26aec3f258086dddf5d17632bd9d8e0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
