## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4daa7ec54711439eb8323b348b2ce9ed9162b6f7e2017af1a9bdecbf18c763c9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 304–308.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def Fintype.linearCombination : (α → R) →ₗ[R] M where
  toFun f := ∑ i, f i • v i
  map_add' f g := by simp_rw [← Finset.sum_add_distrib, ← add_smul]; rfl
  map_smul' r f := by simp_rw [Finset.smul_sum, smul_smul]; rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearCombination/Variantb84d4e8c1db3640fbe9d683f0ad088ae7d40ebc0531affe1bd712da0d6c3afb2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearCombination/Variantb84d4e8c1db3640fbe9d683f0ad088ae7d40ebc0531affe1bd712da0d6c3afb2.lean#L304).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1428f8cd922fadbf2308bb22b216201f3e607eda` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
