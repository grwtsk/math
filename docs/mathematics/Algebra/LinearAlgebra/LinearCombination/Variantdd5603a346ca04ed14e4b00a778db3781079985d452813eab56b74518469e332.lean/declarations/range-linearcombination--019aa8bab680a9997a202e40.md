## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:014ba334-1fb4-e3c4-86d8-44fdfef6997d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 126–141.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem range_linearCombination : LinearMap.range (linearCombination R v) = span R (range v) := by
  ext x
  constructor
  · intro hx
    rw [LinearMap.mem_range] at hx
    rcases hx with ⟨l, hl⟩
    rw [← hl]
    rw [linearCombination_apply]
    exact sum_mem fun i _ => Submodule.smul_mem _ _ (subset_span (mem_range_self i))
  · apply span_le.2
    intro x hx
    rcases hx with ⟨i, hi⟩
    rw [SetLike.mem_coe, LinearMap.mem_range]
    use single i 1
    simp [hi]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearCombination/Variantdd5603a346ca04ed14e4b00a778db3781079985d452813eab56b74518469e332.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearCombination/Variantdd5603a346ca04ed14e4b00a778db3781079985d452813eab56b74518469e332.lean#L126).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `67dba10a16adc1d18cff5cfc7e80a6d2d8366986` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
