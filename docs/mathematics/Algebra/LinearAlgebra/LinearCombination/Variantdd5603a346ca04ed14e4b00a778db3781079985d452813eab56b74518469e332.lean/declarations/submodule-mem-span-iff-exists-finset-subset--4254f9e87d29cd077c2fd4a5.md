## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:861a2f17-c333-8752-732d-29bbe6964fdc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 436–445.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Submodule.mem_span_iff_exists_finset_subset {s : Set M} {x : M} :
    x ∈ span R s ↔
      ∃ (f : M → R) (t : Finset M), ↑t ⊆ s ∧ f.support ⊆ t ∧ ∑ a ∈ t, f a • a = x where
  mp := by
    rw [← s.image_id, mem_span_image_iff_linearCombination]
    rintro ⟨l, hl, rfl⟩
    exact ⟨l, l.support, by simpa [linearCombination, Finsupp.sum] using hl⟩
  mpr := by
    rintro ⟨n, t, hts, -, rfl⟩; exact sum_mem fun x hx ↦ smul_mem _ _ <| subset_span <| hts hx

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearCombination/Variantdd5603a346ca04ed14e4b00a778db3781079985d452813eab56b74518469e332.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearCombination/Variantdd5603a346ca04ed14e4b00a778db3781079985d452813eab56b74518469e332.lean#L436).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `67dba10a16adc1d18cff5cfc7e80a6d2d8366986` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
