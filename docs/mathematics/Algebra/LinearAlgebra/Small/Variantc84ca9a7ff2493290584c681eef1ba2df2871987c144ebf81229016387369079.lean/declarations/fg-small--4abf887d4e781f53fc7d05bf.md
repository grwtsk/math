## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9ddca04f-bfa6-4055-c048-e592d11f6497`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–61.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem FG.small [Small.{u} R] (P : Submodule R M) (hP : P.FG) : Small.{u} P := by
  rw [fg_iff_exists_fin_generating_family] at hP
  obtain ⟨n, s, rfl⟩ := hP
  rw [← Fintype.range_linearCombination]
  apply small_range

variable (R M) in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Small/Variantc84ca9a7ff2493290584c681eef1ba2df2871987c144ebf81229016387369079.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Small/Variantc84ca9a7ff2493290584c681eef1ba2df2871987c144ebf81229016387369079.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8e0ba852a905b3e7e4afd1795c763559468c1042` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
