## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:51f60a0b-13d1-1692-3891-82c2feb206c2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 245–251.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isWeight_zero_of_nilpotent [Nontrivial M] [LieAlgebra.IsNilpotent R L] [IsNilpotent R L M] :
    IsWeight (⊤ : LieSubalgebra R L) M 0 := by
  rw [IsWeight, LieHom.coe_zero, zero_weightSpace_eq_top_of_nilpotent]; exact top_ne_bot
#align lie_module.is_weight_zero_of_nilpotent LieModule.isWeight_zero_of_nilpotent

/-- A (nilpotent) Lie algebra acts nilpotently on the zero weight space of a Noetherian Lie
module. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Weights/Variantb0c478c2ca3fefc561b079aad4ee0c05d352c8701d85e4cfee0a7beb89d50097.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Weights/Variantb0c478c2ca3fefc561b079aad4ee0c05d352c8701d85e4cfee0a7beb89d50097.lean#L245).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1a2e4f35d737bfe03ac24ea2611d637d14d70e91` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
