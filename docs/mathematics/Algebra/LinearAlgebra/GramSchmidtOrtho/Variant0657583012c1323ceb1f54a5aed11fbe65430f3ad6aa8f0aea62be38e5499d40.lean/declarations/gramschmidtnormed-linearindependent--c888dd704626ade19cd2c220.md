## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8de29f73-b199-e568-145c-6dedbe2f7118`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 311–326.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem gramSchmidtNormed_linearIndependent {f : ι → E} (h₀ : LinearIndependent 𝕜 f) :
    LinearIndependent 𝕜 (gramSchmidtNormed 𝕜 f) := by
  unfold gramSchmidtNormed
  have (i : ι) : IsUnit (‖gramSchmidt 𝕜 f i‖⁻¹ : 𝕜) :=
    isUnit_iff_ne_zero.mpr (by simp [gramSchmidt_ne_zero i h₀])
  let w : ι → 𝕜ˣ := fun i ↦ (this i).unit
  apply (gramSchmidt_linearIndependent h₀).units_smul (w := fun i ↦ (this i).unit)

section OrthonormalBasis

variable [Fintype ι] [FiniteDimensional 𝕜 E] (h : finrank 𝕜 E = Fintype.card ι) (f : ι → E)

/-- Given an indexed family `f : ι → E` of vectors in an inner product space `E`, for which the
size of the index set is the dimension of `E`, produce an orthonormal basis for `E` which agrees
with the orthonormal set produced by the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process on the elements of
`ι` for which this process gives a nonzero number. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/GramSchmidtOrtho/Variant0657583012c1323ceb1f54a5aed11fbe65430f3ad6aa8f0aea62be38e5499d40.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/GramSchmidtOrtho/Variant0657583012c1323ceb1f54a5aed11fbe65430f3ad6aa8f0aea62be38e5499d40.lean#L311).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3f8be2b03e4cade39b9ab5b87b8448e28bb18f11` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
