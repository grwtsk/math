## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:831892b8-8b8f-22b1-9d29-59971f551213`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–75.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem GradedAlgebra.liftι_eq (i : ℕ) (x : ⋀[R]^i M) :
    GradedAlgebra.liftι R M x = DirectSum.of (fun i => ⋀[R]^i M) i x := by
  obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ := x
  dsimp only [Subtype.coe_mk, DirectSum.lof_eq_of]
  induction hx using Submodule.pow_induction_on_left' with
  | algebraMap => simp_rw [AlgHom.commutes, DirectSum.algebraMap_apply]; rfl
  | add _ _ _ _ _ ihx ihy => simp_rw [map_add, ihx, ihy, ← AddMonoidHom.map_add]; rfl
  | mem_mul _ hm _ _ _ ih =>
      obtain ⟨_, rfl⟩ := hm
      simp_rw [map_mul, ih, GradedAlgebra.liftι, lift_ι_apply, GradedAlgebra.ι_apply R M,
        DirectSum.of_mul_of]
      exact DirectSum.of_eq_of_gradedMonoid_eq (Sigma.subtype_ext (add_comm _ _) rfl)

/-- The exterior algebra is graded by the powers of the submodule `(ExteriorAlgebra.ι R).range`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Grading/Variant767766016422262a3283253169baf78ab97f2cc4a01cb4bf51c436ad071e0a57.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Grading/Variant767766016422262a3283253169baf78ab97f2cc4a01cb4bf51c436ad071e0a57.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bacb6d1d414589e4e57a2fcc90eb80c376e9f7d8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
