## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:eb6fc301c4b65005581c314f3a1f70bba108f82f29d2d9222cd30b8a42c163e8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 495–504.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simps] def indexEquivAllRoots : ι ≃ (allRoots P).toFinset :=
  { toFun i := ⟨P.root i, List.mem_toFinset.mpr <| mem_allRoots P i⟩
    invFun x := (allRoots_subset_range_root P x.property).choose
    left_inv i := by simp
    right_inv := by
      rintro ⟨x, hx⟩
      simp only [Subtype.mk.injEq]
      exact (allRoots_subset_range_root P hx).choose_spec }

include P in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/G2/Variant213e306aab0cbc596fd1acb9cf0d62b6d1d51c5f36d9611a699c3e2d159892c1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/G2/Variant213e306aab0cbc596fd1acb9cf0d62b6d1d51c5f36d9611a699c3e2d159892c1.lean#L495).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b94f8da98fba941335109439534b52b3a154c78c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
