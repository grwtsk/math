## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f355ce47-9ce5-6e5c-2b50-dde2e045a5ff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 99–111.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_finset (x : M ⊗[R] N) :
    ∃ S : Finset (M × N), x = S.sum fun i ↦ i.1 ⊗ₜ[R] i.2 := by
  obtain ⟨S, h⟩ := exists_finsupp_left x
  use S.graph
  rw [h, Finsupp.sum]
  apply Finset.sum_nbij' (fun m ↦ ⟨m, S m⟩) Prod.fst <;> simp

/-- For a finite subset `s` of `M ⊗[R] N`, there are finitely generated
submodules `M'` and `N'` of `M` and `N`, respectively, such that `s` is contained in the image
of `M' ⊗[R] N'` in `M ⊗[R] N`.

In particular, every element of a tensor product lies in the tensor product of some finite
submodules. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Finiteness/Variantf233b4cf39d1c224de5bac02282e0db3c0e6660939d53776f420c54cac97e2e3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Finiteness/Variantf233b4cf39d1c224de5bac02282e0db3c0e6660939d53776f420c54cac97e2e3.lean#L99).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d0ee288ab0f9b26f61f64e09ebbb2ce355ac604a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
