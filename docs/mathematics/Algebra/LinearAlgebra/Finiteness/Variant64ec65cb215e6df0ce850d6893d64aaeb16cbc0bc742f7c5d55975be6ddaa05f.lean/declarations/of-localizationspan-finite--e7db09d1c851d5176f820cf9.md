## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:315ce337-3a33-540d-1c32-064051106236`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 260–269.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem of_localizationSpan_finite (t : Finset R) (ht : Ideal.span (t : Set R) = ⊤)
    (H : ∀ (g : t), Module.Finite (Localization.Away g.val)
      (LocalizedModule.Away g.val M)) :
    Module.Finite R M :=
  let f (g : t) : M →ₗ[R] LocalizedModule.Away g.val M :=
    LocalizedModule.mkLinearMap (Submonoid.powers g.val) M
  of_localizationSpan_finite' t ht f H

/-- If there exists a set `{ r }` of `R` that generates the unit ideal and such that `Mᵣ` is
`Rᵣ`-finite for each `r`, then `M` is a finite `R`-module. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Finiteness/Variant64ec65cb215e6df0ce850d6893d64aaeb16cbc0bc742f7c5d55975be6ddaa05f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Finiteness/Variant64ec65cb215e6df0ce850d6893d64aaeb16cbc0bc742f7c5d55975be6ddaa05f.lean#L260).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7018b40eabf49ec528bd09b9d9924a3fd31165bd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
