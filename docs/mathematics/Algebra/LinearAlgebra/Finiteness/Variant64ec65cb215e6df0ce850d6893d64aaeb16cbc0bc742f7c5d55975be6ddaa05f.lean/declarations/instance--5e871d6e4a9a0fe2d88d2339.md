## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7fa614dac881ef30dcddfebf36150bd900941bac13185c36de47a7b84cc88f65`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 185–200.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [Module.Finite R M] : Module.Finite (Localization S) (LocalizedModule S M) :=
  of_isLocalizedModule S (LocalizedModule.mkLinearMap S M)

end

variable {R : Type u} [CommSemiring R] {M : Type w} [AddCommMonoid M] [Module R M]

/--
If there exists a finite set `{ r }` of `R` that generates the unit ideal and such that `Mᵣ` is
`Rᵣ`-finite for each `r`, then `M` is a finite `R`-module.

General version for any modules `Mᵣ` and rings `Rᵣ` satisfying the correct universal properties.
See `Module.Finite.of_localizationSpan_finite` for the specialized version.

See `of_localizationSpan'` for a version without the finite set assumption.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Finiteness/Variant64ec65cb215e6df0ce850d6893d64aaeb16cbc0bc742f7c5d55975be6ddaa05f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Finiteness/Variant64ec65cb215e6df0ce850d6893d64aaeb16cbc0bc742f7c5d55975be6ddaa05f.lean#L185).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7018b40eabf49ec528bd09b9d9924a3fd31165bd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
