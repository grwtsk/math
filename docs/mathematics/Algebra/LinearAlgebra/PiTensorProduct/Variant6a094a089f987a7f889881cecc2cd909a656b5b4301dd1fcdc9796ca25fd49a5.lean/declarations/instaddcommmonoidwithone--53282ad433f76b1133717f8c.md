## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fec5c5101a525f2683b448edc645c11b6e46d73e79a0361f204f93359a54785e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 36–50.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instAddCommMonoidWithOne : AddCommMonoidWithOne (⨂[R] i, A i) where
  __ := inferInstanceAs (AddCommMonoid (⨂[R] i, A i))
  __ := instOne

end AddCommMonoidWithOne

noncomputable section NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring

variable [CommSemiring R] [∀ i, NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring (A i)]
variable [∀ i, Module R (A i)] [∀ i, SMulCommClass R (A i) (A i)] [∀ i, IsScalarTower R (A i) (A i)]

attribute [aesop safe] mul_add mul_smul_comm smul_mul_assoc add_mul in
/--
The multiplication in tensor product of rings is induced by `(xᵢ) * (yᵢ) = (xᵢ * yᵢ)`
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PiTensorProduct/Variant6a094a089f987a7f889881cecc2cd909a656b5b4301dd1fcdc9796ca25fd49a5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PiTensorProduct/Variant6a094a089f987a7f889881cecc2cd909a656b5b4301dd1fcdc9796ca25fd49a5.lean#L36).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `71ca646e36a876541bf363464f47cc865e2ad21a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
