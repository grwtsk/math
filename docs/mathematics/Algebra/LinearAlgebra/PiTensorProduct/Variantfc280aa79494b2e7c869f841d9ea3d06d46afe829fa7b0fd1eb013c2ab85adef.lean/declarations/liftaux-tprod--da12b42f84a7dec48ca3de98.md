## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:67c05fdb-2d11-5883-ce79-5463d213d7d6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 374–381.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem liftAux_tprod (φ : MultilinearMap R s E) (f : ∀ i, s i) : liftAux φ (tprod R f) = φ f := by
  simp only [liftAux, liftAddHom, tprod_eq_tprodCoeff_one, tprodCoeff, AddCon.coe_mk']
  rw [FreeAddMonoid.of, FreeAddMonoid.ofList, Equiv.refl_apply, AddCon.lift_coe]
  dsimp [FreeAddMonoid.lift, FreeAddMonoid.sumAux]
  show _ • _ = _
  rw [one_smul]
#align pi_tensor_product.lift_aux_tprod PiTensorProduct.liftAux_tprod

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PiTensorProduct/Variantfc280aa79494b2e7c869f841d9ea3d06d46afe829fa7b0fd1eb013c2ab85adef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PiTensorProduct/Variantfc280aa79494b2e7c869f841d9ea3d06d46afe829fa7b0fd1eb013c2ab85adef.lean#L374).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `83d5919086a85cd4a94e72f9290d6fe3ce94e71e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
