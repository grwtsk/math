## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:96b0f2f4-2c7a-74a1-09cc-868fa7866d64`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 447–454.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem det_eq_of_eq_det_one_mul {A B : Matrix n n R} (C : Matrix n n R) (hC : det C = 1)
    (hA : A = C * B) : det A = det B :=
  calc
    det A = det (C * B) := congr_arg _ hA
    _ = det C * det B := (det_mul _ _)
    _ = det B := by rw [hC, one_mul]
#align matrix.det_eq_of_eq_det_one_mul Matrix.det_eq_of_eq_det_one_mul

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Determinant/Variant431580c1831354c9a70718160e7fe3a5d31b378d7f0b4e0858f712cfb9120cf4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Determinant/Variant431580c1831354c9a70718160e7fe3a5d31b378d7f0b4e0858f712cfb9120cf4.lean#L447).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8c536a6eaffecee5111c064aa0257798c22dc402` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
