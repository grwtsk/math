## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4c60d83ca714edae129349cf9799b98df3cd43cdfa22683d9b376e6011ddc6d8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 512–529.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def LinearEquiv.ofIsUnitDet {f : M →ₗ[R] M'} {v : Basis ι R M} {v' : Basis ι R M'}
    (h : IsUnit (LinearMap.toMatrix v v' f).det) : M ≃ₗ[R] M' where
  toFun := f
  map_add' := f.map_add
  map_smul' := f.map_smul
  invFun := toLin v' v (toMatrix v v' f)⁻¹
  left_inv x :=
    calc toLin v' v (toMatrix v v' f)⁻¹ (f x)
      _ = toLin v v ((toMatrix v v' f)⁻¹ * toMatrix v v' f) x := by
        rw [toLin_mul v v' v, toLin_toMatrix, LinearMap.comp_apply]
      _ = x := by simp [h]
  right_inv x :=
    calc f (toLin v' v (toMatrix v v' f)⁻¹ x)
      _ = toLin v' v' (toMatrix v v' f * (toMatrix v v' f)⁻¹) x := by
        rw [toLin_mul v' v v', LinearMap.comp_apply, toLin_toMatrix v v']
      _ = x := by simp [h]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Determinant/Variant53f430b28c7c5b1dd09711ffae37ac8455eb4ea053bf4713da7c8141ad61cc47.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Determinant/Variant53f430b28c7c5b1dd09711ffae37ac8455eb4ea053bf4713da7c8141ad61cc47.lean#L512).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `986ae30a9d7245d1525fb35f1ffc55e0c22209f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
