## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e859b060898ed25080082a3cbfe288c0740c3caec135bfd3a1e3f79437695a87`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 485–489.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mapEquiv (g : M ≃ₗ[R] N) :
    DividedPowerAlgebra R M ≃ₐ[R] DividedPowerAlgebra R N :=
  AlgEquiv.ofAlgHom (map R g.toLinearMap) (map R g.symm.toLinearMap)
    (by simp [← map_comp, map_id]) (by simp [← map_comp, map_id])

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Init/Variant3bfa852e2ac7e05cf1bbbd49e07854032bfca5b4ceb1e3f8d07da0954e35c289.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Init/Variant3bfa852e2ac7e05cf1bbbd49e07854032bfca5b4ceb1e3f8d07da0954e35c289.lean#L485).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c2bf2f741f7fb940393f9648a2583df3098081a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
