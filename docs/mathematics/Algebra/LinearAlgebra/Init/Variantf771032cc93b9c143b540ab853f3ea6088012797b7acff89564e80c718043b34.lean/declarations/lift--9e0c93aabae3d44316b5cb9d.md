## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b51217390313ec20487851f4502c43571faf7c2ec038a2a63ee04bdaea3a325d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 355–367.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def lift : DividedPowerAlgebra R M →ₐ[R] A :=
  lift' (f := fun nm ↦ hI.dpow nm.1 (g nm.2))
    (fun m ↦ hI.dpow_zero (hg m))
    (fun n r m ↦ by
      dsimp only
      rw [LinearMap.map_smulₛₗ, RingHom.id_apply, ← algebraMap_smul A r (g m), smul_eq_mul,
        hI.dpow_mul (hg m), ← smul_eq_mul, ← map_pow, algebraMap_smul])
    (fun n p m ↦ by rw [hI.mul_dpow (hg m), ← nsmul_eq_mul])
    (fun n u v ↦ by simp [hI.dpow_add (hg u) (hg v)])

variable {g}

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Init/Variantf771032cc93b9c143b540ab853f3ea6088012797b7acff89564e80c718043b34.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Init/Variantf771032cc93b9c143b540ab853f3ea6088012797b7acff89564e80c718043b34.lean#L355).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5c8edb599c09fbeac461dbedf7864010de1ebb30` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
