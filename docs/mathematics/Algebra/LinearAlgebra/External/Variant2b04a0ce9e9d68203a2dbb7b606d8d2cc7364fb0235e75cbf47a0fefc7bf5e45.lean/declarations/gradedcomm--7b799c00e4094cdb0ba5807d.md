## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8c9fd9d573334183dbf84a1d558e2299ae6aa55e775a51e3898865c63ac399ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 109–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def gradedComm :
    (⨁ i, 𝒜 i) ⊗[R] (⨁ i, ℬ i) ≃ₗ[R] (⨁ i, ℬ i) ⊗[R] (⨁ i, 𝒜 i) := by
  refine TensorProduct.directSum R R 𝒜 ℬ ≪≫ₗ ?_ ≪≫ₗ (TensorProduct.directSum R R ℬ 𝒜).symm

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/External/Variant2b04a0ce9e9d68203a2dbb7b606d8d2cc7364fb0235e75cbf47a0fefc7bf5e45.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/External/Variant2b04a0ce9e9d68203a2dbb7b606d8d2cc7364fb0235e75cbf47a0fefc7bf5e45.lean#L109).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b15b3543350880819b600e9be2ffcda9f1212201` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
