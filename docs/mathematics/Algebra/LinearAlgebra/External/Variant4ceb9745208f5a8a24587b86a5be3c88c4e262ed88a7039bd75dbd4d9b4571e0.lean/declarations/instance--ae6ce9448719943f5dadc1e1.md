## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7deb2573c1d74df894348b8a62fc190f07532e0f6b4e309eeb7c0b46aa093636`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 63–77.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (i : ι × ι) : Module R (𝒜 (Prod.fst i) ⊗[R] ℬ (Prod.snd i)) :=
  TensorProduct.leftModule

open DirectSum (lof)

variable (R)

section gradedComm

local notation "𝒜ℬ" => (fun i : ι × ι => 𝒜 (Prod.fst i) ⊗[R] ℬ (Prod.snd i))
local notation "ℬ𝒜" => (fun i : ι × ι => ℬ (Prod.fst i) ⊗[R] 𝒜 (Prod.snd i))

/-- Auxiliary construction used to build `TensorProduct.gradedComm`.

This operates on direct sums of tensors instead of tensors of direct sums. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/External/Variant4ceb9745208f5a8a24587b86a5be3c88c4e262ed88a7039bd75dbd4d9b4571e0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/External/Variant4ceb9745208f5a8a24587b86a5be3c88c4e262ed88a7039bd75dbd4d9b4571e0.lean#L63).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `59b892f70e82e6acceb4f84faf0f2939dbd6c004` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
