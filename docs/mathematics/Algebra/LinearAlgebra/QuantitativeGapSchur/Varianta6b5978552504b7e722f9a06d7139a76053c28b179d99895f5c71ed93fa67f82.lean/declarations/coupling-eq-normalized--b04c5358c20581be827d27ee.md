## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:08cb3c4d-7522-c04b-cc4c-6f3a1a1faaec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coupling_eq_normalized (L : Matrix m m ℂ) [Invertible L]
    (C : Matrix n m ℂ) (B : Matrix n n ℂ) [Invertible B] :
    Lᴴ * normalizedCoupling L C B * L = Cᴴ * ⅟B * C := by
  have he : Lᴴ * (⅟L)ᴴ = 1 := by
    rw [← Matrix.conjTranspose_mul, invOf_mul_self, Matrix.conjTranspose_one]
  simp only [normalizedCoupling, ← Matrix.mul_assoc, he, Matrix.one_mul]
  rw [Matrix.mul_assoc, Matrix.mul_assoc, invOf_mul_self, Matrix.mul_one]

/-- A `Γ≤(1-η)I` inequality implies the exact source-form margin used below.
The square-root factor and its inverse are actual supplied matrices, not names. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/QuantitativeGapSchur/Varianta6b5978552504b7e722f9a06d7139a76053c28b179d99895f5c71ed93fa67f82.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/QuantitativeGapSchur/Varianta6b5978552504b7e722f9a06d7139a76053c28b179d99895f5c71ed93fa67f82.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3beac2b8e5bdd4b95e657599d525b6d19f0b48e1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
