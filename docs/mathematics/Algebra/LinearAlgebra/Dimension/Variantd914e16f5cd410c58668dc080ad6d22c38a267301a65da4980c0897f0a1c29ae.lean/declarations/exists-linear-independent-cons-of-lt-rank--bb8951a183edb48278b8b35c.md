## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a1e6fca2-c70b-6f53-5557-3b372713a87e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1121–1138.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_linear_independent_cons_of_lt_rank {n : ℕ} {v : Fin n → V}
    (hv : LinearIndependent K v) (h : n < Module.rank K V) :
    ∃ (x : V), LinearIndependent K (Fin.cons x v) := by
  have A : Submodule.span K (range v) ≠ ⊤ := by
    intro H
    rw [← rank_top, ← H] at h
    have : Module.rank K (Submodule.span K (range v)) ≤ n := by
      have := Cardinal.mk_range_le_lift (f := v)
      simp only [Cardinal.lift_id'] at this
      exact (rank_span_le _).trans (this.trans (by simp))
    exact lt_irrefl _ (h.trans_le this)
  obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ : ∃ x, x ∉ Submodule.span K (range v) := by
    contrapose! A
    exact Iff.mpr Submodule.eq_top_iff' A
  exact ⟨x, linearIndependent_fin_cons.2 ⟨hv, hx⟩⟩

/-- Given a family of `n` linearly independent vectors in a space of dimension `> n`, one may extend
the family by another vector while retaining linear independence. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Dimension/Variantd914e16f5cd410c58668dc080ad6d22c38a267301a65da4980c0897f0a1c29ae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Dimension/Variantd914e16f5cd410c58668dc080ad6d22c38a267301a65da4980c0897f0a1c29ae.lean#L1121).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f6c8a624ef6dde9c17b9763988af3c37c25e6b1e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
