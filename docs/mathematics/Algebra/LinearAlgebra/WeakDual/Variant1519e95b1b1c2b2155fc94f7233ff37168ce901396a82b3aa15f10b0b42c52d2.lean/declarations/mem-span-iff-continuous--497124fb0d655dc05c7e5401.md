## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a9f27211-08a1-b980-c9df-0341bc61d522`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–170.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem mem_span_iff_continuous {f : ι → E →ₗ[𝕜] 𝕜} (φ : E →ₗ[𝕜] 𝕜) :
    φ ∈ Submodule.span 𝕜 (Set.range f) ↔
    Continuous[⨅ i, induced (f i) inferInstance, inferInstance] φ := by
  let t𝕜 : TopologicalSpace 𝕜 := inferInstance
  let t₁ : TopologicalSpace E := ⨅ i, induced (f i) t𝕜
  let t₂ (s : Finset ι) : TopologicalSpace E := ⨅ i : s, induced (f i) t𝕜
  suffices
      Continuous[t₁, t𝕜] φ ↔ ∃ s : Finset ι, Continuous[t₂ s, t𝕜] φ by
    simp_rw [this, ← mem_span_iff_continuous_of_finite, Submodule.span_range_eq_iSup,

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/WeakDual/Variant1519e95b1b1c2b2155fc94f7233ff37168ce901396a82b3aa15f10b0b42c52d2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/WeakDual/Variant1519e95b1b1c2b2155fc94f7233ff37168ce901396a82b3aa15f10b0b42c52d2.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ec12ffe16920ff1577d627ad05b1be24b22c2dd9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
