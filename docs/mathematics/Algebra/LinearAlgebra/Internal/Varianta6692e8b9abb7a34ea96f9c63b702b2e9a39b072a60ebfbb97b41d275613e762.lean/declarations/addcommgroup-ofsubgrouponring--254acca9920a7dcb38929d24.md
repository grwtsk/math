## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4aa43d624df4fc9e1c7a0f2ab49fe64457cdd96aa9f87e0fab52d73ee8fa7b91`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–55.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance AddCommGroup.ofSubgroupOnRing [Ring R] [SetLike σ R] [AddSubgroupClass σ R] (A : ι → σ) :
    ∀ i, AddCommGroup (A i) := fun i => by infer_instance
#align add_comm_group.of_subgroup_on_ring AddCommGroup.ofSubgroupOnRing

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Internal/Varianta6692e8b9abb7a34ea96f9c63b702b2e9a39b072a60ebfbb97b41d275613e762.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Internal/Varianta6692e8b9abb7a34ea96f9c63b702b2e9a39b072a60ebfbb97b41d275613e762.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `67a020ee476dd4f3979130451d66a933bb5cd29e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
