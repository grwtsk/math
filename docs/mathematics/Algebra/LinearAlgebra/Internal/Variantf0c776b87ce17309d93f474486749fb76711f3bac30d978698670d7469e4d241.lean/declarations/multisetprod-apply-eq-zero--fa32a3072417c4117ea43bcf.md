## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:210f1b55-138e-5b22-2adc-7d005f36ed6e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 500–508.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem multisetProd_apply_eq_zero {s : Multiset (⨁ i, A i)} {m : ι}
    (hs : ∀ x ∈ s, ∀ k < m, x k = 0) ⦃n : ι⦄ (hn : n < s.card • m) :
    s.prod n = 0 := by
  have := listProd_apply_eq_zero (l := s.toList) (by simpa using hs)
    (by simpa [← Multiset.sum_coe, ← Multiset.map_coe])
  simpa [← Multiset.prod_coe, ← Multiset.map_coe]

/-- The difference with `DirectSum.finsetProd_apply_eq_zero` is that the indices at which
the terms of the multiset are zero is allowed to vary. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Internal/Variantf0c776b87ce17309d93f474486749fb76711f3bac30d978698670d7469e4d241.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Internal/Variantf0c776b87ce17309d93f474486749fb76711f3bac30d978698670d7469e4d241.lean#L500).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6313e75f01ff9a65c277c42e3dbe6e46f415cda9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
