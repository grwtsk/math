## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e337017989963897cdf0cf2e579edbe2b051dd527672dd4a1c15cdbdae9a7b51`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 333–351.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def liftEquiv :
    { fg : (A →ₐ[R] C) × (B →ₐ[R] C) //
        ∀ ⦃i j⦄ (a : 𝒜 i) (b : ℬ j), fg.1 a * fg.2 b = (-1 : ℤˣ)^(j * i) • (fg.2 b * fg.1 a)} ≃
      ((𝒜 ᵍ⊗[R] ℬ) →ₐ[R] C) where
  toFun fg := lift 𝒜 ℬ _ _ fg.prop
  invFun F := ⟨(F.comp (includeLeft 𝒜 ℬ), F.comp (includeRight 𝒜 ℬ)), fun i j a b => by
    dsimp
    rw [← map_mul, ← map_mul F, tmul_coe_mul_coe_tmul, one_mul, mul_one, AlgHom.map_smul_of_tower,
      tmul_one_mul_one_tmul, smul_smul, Int.units_mul_self, one_smul]⟩
  left_inv fg := by ext <;> (dsimp; simp only [map_one, mul_one, one_mul])
  right_inv F := by
    apply AlgHom.toLinearMap_injective
    ext
    dsimp
    rw [← map_mul, tmul_one_mul_one_tmul]

and right inclusions agree. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Internal/Variantafdd3cf42f9fb2ee09586498678a2a2fff17a25302ba719e89aed50bf8f2acf4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Internal/Variantafdd3cf42f9fb2ee09586498678a2a2fff17a25302ba719e89aed50bf8f2acf4.lean#L333).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `424c445a0606204a7431c90a9b3ae1a3f1e6ca1e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
