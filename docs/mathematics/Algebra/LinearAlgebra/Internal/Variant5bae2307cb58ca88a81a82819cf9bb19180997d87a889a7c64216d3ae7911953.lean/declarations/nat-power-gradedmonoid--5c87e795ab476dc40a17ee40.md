## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bec78ecde2bef5fdebf32211b950ecd79bf86f90d6ab3f3d3c5e1d09e000a9ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 300–310.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance nat_power_gradedMonoid [CommSemiring S] [Semiring R] [Algebra S R] (p : Submodule S R) :
    SetLike.GradedMonoid fun i : ℕ => p ^ i where
  one_mem := by
    rw [← one_le, pow_zero]
  mul_mem i j p q hp hq := by
    rw [pow_add]
    exact Submodule.mul_mem_mul hp hq

end Submodule

/-- The canonical algebra isomorphism between `⨁ i, A i` and `R`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Internal/Variant5bae2307cb58ca88a81a82819cf9bb19180997d87a889a7c64216d3ae7911953.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Internal/Variant5bae2307cb58ca88a81a82819cf9bb19180997d87a889a7c64216d3ae7911953.lean#L300).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `632f6508a0c14eeedb22f30efbc642fb23f70f4a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
