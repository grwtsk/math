## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:673d8450-4084-1a9c-0936-b79254a8d2ca`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 366–375.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_ge_zero_eq_rootForm (x : M) (hx : x ∈ span S (range P.root)) :
    ∃ s ≥ 0, algebraMap S R s = P.RootForm x x := by
  refine ⟨(P.posRootForm S).posForm ⟨x, hx⟩ ⟨x, hx⟩, IsSumSq.nonneg ?_, by simp [posRootForm]⟩
  choose s hs using P.coroot'_apply_apply_mem_of_mem_span S hx
  suffices (P.posRootForm S).posForm ⟨x, hx⟩ ⟨x, hx⟩ = ∑ i, s i * s i from

  simp [← Algebra.linearMap_apply, hs, rootForm_apply_apply]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/CanonicalBilinear/Variantb6432a3cdd24e36eff1d7afb8abc6b4092dcf6386f128ebc3abd4752108554c1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/CanonicalBilinear/Variantb6432a3cdd24e36eff1d7afb8abc6b4092dcf6386f128ebc3abd4752108554c1.lean#L366).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1788fa8b3f0f713d023307b081fa5663c3aa1d01` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
