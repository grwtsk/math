## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ae67d41f13924b3c34bb2f87f4323e372919b0c9d14ea44746db189ac58ddcae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 66–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance (f : E ≃L[𝕜] F) :
    Inhabited (ContinuousLinearMap.NonlinearRightInverse (f : E →L[𝕜] F)) :=
  ⟨f.toNonlinearRightInverse⟩

/-! ### Proof of the Banach open mapping theorem -/


variable [CompleteSpace F]

namespace ContinuousLinearMap

/-- First step of the proof of the Banach open mapping theorem (using completeness of `F`):
by Baire's theorem, there exists a ball in `E` whose image closure has nonempty interior.
Rescaling everything, it follows that any `y ∈ F` is arbitrarily well approached by
images of elements of norm at most `C * ‖y‖`.
For further use, we will only need such an element whose image
is within distance `‖y‖/2` of `y`, to apply an iterative process. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Banach/Variantba55a5442128012f378d8a55626d8f90fd36f9f498147a2e3b9d52d6249ee7a0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Banach/Variantba55a5442128012f378d8a55626d8f90fd36f9f498147a2e3b9d52d6249ee7a0.lean#L66).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e95553dc8bb4a821bea29b8e20eb347fc66a63ee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
