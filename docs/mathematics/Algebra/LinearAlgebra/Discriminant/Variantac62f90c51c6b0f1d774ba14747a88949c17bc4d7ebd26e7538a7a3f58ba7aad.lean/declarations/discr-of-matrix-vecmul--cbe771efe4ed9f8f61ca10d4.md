## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2cc21c53-bd20-7886-3b4b-784183d1c78e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 111–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem discr_of_matrix_vecMul (b : ι → B) (P : Matrix ι ι A) :
    discr A ((P.map (algebraMap A B)).vecMul b) = P.det ^ 2 * discr A b := by
  rw [discr_def, traceMatrix_of_matrix_vecMul, det_mul, det_mul, det_transpose, mul_comm, ←
    mul_assoc, discr_def, pow_two]
#align algebra.discr_of_matrix_vec_mul Algebra.discr_of_matrix_vecMul

/-- Relation between `Algebra.discr A ι b` and
`Algebra.discr A ((P.map (algebraMap A B)).mulVec b)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Discriminant/Variantac62f90c51c6b0f1d774ba14747a88949c17bc4d7ebd26e7538a7a3f58ba7aad.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Discriminant/Variantac62f90c51c6b0f1d774ba14747a88949c17bc4d7ebd26e7538a7a3f58ba7aad.lean#L111).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `af4a8c40634ac4c32a63c6f8aea15d92877b2208` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
