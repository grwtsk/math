## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e7b61029-5e80-def4-b81d-dbc0eb08787f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 539–550.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Subalgebra.rank_top : Module.rank F (⊤ : Subalgebra F E) = Module.rank F E := by
  rw [subalgebra_top_rank_eq_submodule_top_rank]
  exact _root_.rank_top F E

end Semiring

section Ring

variable {F E : Type*} [CommRing F] [Ring E] [Algebra F E]
variable [StrongRankCondition F] [NoZeroSMulDivisors F E] [Nontrivial E]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Constructions/Variant0cecbe331a1249e3ba680d06f287e621d12132c610b7f7537a54073c8906cb4a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Constructions/Variant0cecbe331a1249e3ba680d06f287e621d12132c610b7f7537a54073c8906cb4a.lean#L539).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2616590f7387c5ef7ded451ecd988c1ac27c61a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
