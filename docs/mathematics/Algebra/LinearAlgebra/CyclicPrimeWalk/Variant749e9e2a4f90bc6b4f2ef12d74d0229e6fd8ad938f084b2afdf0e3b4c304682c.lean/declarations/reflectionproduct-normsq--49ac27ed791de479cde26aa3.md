## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0ddf8d96-8b62-e977-f720-14b87853ed19`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 558–569.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem reflectionProduct_normSq (choice : ℕ → Bool) (n : ℕ)
    (v : StandardCoord) :
    coordNormSq (Matrix.mulVec (reflectionProduct choice n) v) = coordNormSq v := by
  induction n with
  | zero => simp [reflectionProduct]
  | succ n ih =>
      rw [reflectionProduct, ← Matrix.mulVec_mulVec]
      rw [chosenReflection_normSq, ih]

/-- A word of `n` transpositions has determinant `(-1)^n`; this is the exact
algebraic parity obstruction behind the non-lazy walk's period two. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/CyclicPrimeWalk/Variant749e9e2a4f90bc6b4f2ef12d74d0229e6fd8ad938f084b2afdf0e3b4c304682c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/CyclicPrimeWalk/Variant749e9e2a4f90bc6b4f2ef12d74d0229e6fd8ad938f084b2afdf0e3b4c304682c.lean#L558).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1c7ecfe1c265e96e1d7ed3bbe18bc9d4a5f58afc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
