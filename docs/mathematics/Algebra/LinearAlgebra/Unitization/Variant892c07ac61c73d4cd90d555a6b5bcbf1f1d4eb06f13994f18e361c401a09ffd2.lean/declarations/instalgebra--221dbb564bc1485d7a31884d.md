## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a5c8adc71a970b182c30c1c26b354ac5f5c6c0ed20f82db6ff48b81f8c7b486e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 631–644.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instAlgebra : Algebra S (Unitization R A) where
  algebraMap := (Unitization.inlRingHom R A).comp (algebraMap S R)
  commutes' := fun s x => by
    induction x with
    | inl_add_inr =>
      change inl (algebraMap S R s) * _ = _ * inl (algebraMap S R s)
      rw [mul_add, add_mul, inl_mul_inl, inl_mul_inl, inl_mul_inr, inr_mul_inl, mul_comm]
  smul_def' := fun s x => by
    induction x with
    | inl_add_inr =>
      change _ = inl (algebraMap S R s) * _
      rw [mul_add, smul_add, Algebra.algebraMap_eq_smul_one, inl_mul_inl, inl_mul_inr,
        smul_one_mul, inl_smul, inr_smul, smul_one_smul]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Unitization/Variant892c07ac61c73d4cd90d555a6b5bcbf1f1d4eb06f13994f18e361c401a09ffd2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Unitization/Variant892c07ac61c73d4cd90d555a6b5bcbf1f1d4eb06f13994f18e361c401a09ffd2.lean#L631).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8e90b80b9e5653c4a47f6423fc8a2b325d68fb7c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
