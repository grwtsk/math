## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:84375d78-a93a-54b5-a8ce-4ad753021229`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 874–880.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma starMap_comp {φ : A →⋆ₙₐ[R] B} {ψ : B →⋆ₙₐ[R] C} :
    starMap (ψ.comp φ) = (starMap ψ).comp (starMap φ) := by
  ext; all_goals simp

/-- `starMap` is functorial:
`starMap (NonUnitalStarAlgHom.id R B) = StarAlgHom.id R (Unitization R B)`. -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Unitization/Variant7db0d1bfe8dcaa76c29f08420b187694ab9f003571bf5f385b937bca072f8bc8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Unitization/Variant7db0d1bfe8dcaa76c29f08420b187694ab9f003571bf5f385b937bca072f8bc8.lean#L874).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5090788d9a9b3101f6d2a35ab3dcac8f0faea5eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
