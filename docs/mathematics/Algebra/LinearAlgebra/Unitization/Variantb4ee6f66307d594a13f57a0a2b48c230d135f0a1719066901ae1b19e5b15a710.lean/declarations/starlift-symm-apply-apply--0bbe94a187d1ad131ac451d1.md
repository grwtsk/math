## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:72e100b1-f424-fc06-f2aa-9a391e2aadae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 751–771.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem starLift_symm_apply_apply (φ : Unitization R A →⋆ₐ[R] C) (a : A) :
    Unitization.starLift.symm φ a = φ a :=
  rfl

end StarAlgHom

section StarMap

variable {R A B C : Type*} [CommSemiring R] [StarRing R]
variable [NonUnitalSemiring A] [StarRing A] [Module R A] [SMulCommClass R A A] [IsScalarTower R A A]
variable [NonUnitalSemiring B] [StarRing B] [Module R B] [SMulCommClass R B B] [IsScalarTower R B B]
variable [NonUnitalSemiring C] [StarRing C] [Module R C] [SMulCommClass R C C] [IsScalarTower R C C]
variable [StarModule R B] [StarModule R C]

/-- The functorial map on morphisms between the category of non-unital C⋆-algebras with non-unital
star homomorphisms and unital C⋆-algebras with unital star homomorphisms.

This sends `φ : A →⋆ₙₐ[R] B` to a map `Unitization R A →⋆ₐ[R] Unitization R B` given by the formula
`(r, a) ↦ (r, φ a)` (or perhaps more precisely,
`algebraMap R _ r + ↑a ↦ algebraMap R _ r + ↑(φ a)`). -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Unitization/Variantb4ee6f66307d594a13f57a0a2b48c230d135f0a1719066901ae1b19e5b15a710.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Unitization/Variantb4ee6f66307d594a13f57a0a2b48c230d135f0a1719066901ae1b19e5b15a710.lean#L751).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f9c92df87edba1a7978358a785dbab0dc0256d67` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
