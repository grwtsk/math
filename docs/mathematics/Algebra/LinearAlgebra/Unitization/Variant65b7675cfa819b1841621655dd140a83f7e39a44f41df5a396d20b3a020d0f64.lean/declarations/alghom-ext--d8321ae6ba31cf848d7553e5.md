## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:af5bdb79-49ac-995e-e3f5-522696d59443`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 696–712.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem algHom_ext' {φ ψ : Unitization R A →ₐ[R] C}
    (h :
      φ.toNonUnitalAlgHom.comp (inrNonUnitalAlgHom R A) =
        ψ.toNonUnitalAlgHom.comp (inrNonUnitalAlgHom R A)) :
    φ = ψ :=
  algHom_ext'' (NonUnitalAlgHom.congr_fun h)
#align unitization.alg_hom_ext' Unitization.algHom_ext'

/- porting note: this was extracted from `Unitization.lift` below, where it had previously
been inlined. Unfortunately, `Unitization.lift` was relatively slow in Lean 3, but in Lean 4 it
just times out. Note that this doesn't require a backport because this file is a leaf in the
import hierarchy. -/
/-- A non-unital algebra homomorphism from `A` into a unital `R`-algebra `C` lifts to a unital
algebra homomorphism from the unitization into `C`. This is extended to an `Equiv` in
`Unitization.lift` and that should be used instead. This declaration only exists for performance
reasons. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Unitization/Variant65b7675cfa819b1841621655dd140a83f7e39a44f41df5a396d20b3a020d0f64.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Unitization/Variant65b7675cfa819b1841621655dd140a83f7e39a44f41df5a396d20b3a020d0f64.lean#L696).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `016ae7132182e92fb3ccd4618358a2e9bef2e9fe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
