## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0d1a1d22a5b7bc6a60eb5d4a9ede2ed57d3951bc8fe2f9518a9c554b39c78185`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 464–471.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instCommMonoid [CommMonoid R] [NonUnitalCommSemiring A] [DistribMulAction R A]
    [IsScalarTower R A A] [SMulCommClass R A A] : CommMonoid (Unitization R A) :=
  { Unitization.instMonoid with
    mul_comm := fun x₁ x₂ =>
      ext (mul_comm x₁.1 x₂.1) <|
        show x₁.1 • x₂.2 + x₂.1 • x₁.2 + x₁.2 * x₂.2 = x₂.1 • x₁.2 + x₁.1 • x₂.2 + x₂.2 * x₁.2 by
          rw [add_comm (x₁.1 • x₂.2), mul_comm] }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Unitization/Variant4d5915a259624cfa9d83016f92c7e0ec3c222476d02bc2bd5b82cad3bf6d09f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Unitization/Variant4d5915a259624cfa9d83016f92c7e0ec3c222476d02bc2bd5b82cad3bf6d09f2.lean#L464).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7e2e7c4b962a92dfa6733c99b68ab2205c64aff7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
