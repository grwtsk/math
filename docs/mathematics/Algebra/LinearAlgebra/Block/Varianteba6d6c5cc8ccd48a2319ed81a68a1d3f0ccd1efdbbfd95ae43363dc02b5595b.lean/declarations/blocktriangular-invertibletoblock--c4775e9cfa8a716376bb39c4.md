## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:56bc60fca6988d9f53410ffa14656b9097a5cd8c00dfe35b6122537a04beb5da`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 286–293.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def BlockTriangular.invertibleToBlock [LinearOrder α] [Invertible M] (hM : BlockTriangular M b)
    (k : α) : Invertible (M.toBlock (fun i => b i < k) fun i => b i < k) :=
  invertibleOfLeftInverse _ ((⅟ M).toBlock (fun i => b i < k) fun i => b i < k) <| by
    simpa only [invOf_eq_nonsing_inv] using hM.toBlock_inverse_mul_toBlock_eq_one k
#align matrix.block_triangular.invertible_to_block Matrix.BlockTriangular.invertibleToBlock

/-- A lower-left subblock of the inverse of a block-triangular matrix is zero. This is a first step
towards `BlockTriangular.inv_toBlock` below. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Block/Varianteba6d6c5cc8ccd48a2319ed81a68a1d3f0ccd1efdbbfd95ae43363dc02b5595b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Block/Varianteba6d6c5cc8ccd48a2319ed81a68a1d3f0ccd1efdbbfd95ae43363dc02b5595b.lean#L286).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d57b471e4911406eb326b70629dc71cc4f45a250` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
