## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b13910f4c06f7c693c436f9bc016d02f71ab5dbb0830e263eff839680a81b47f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 336–342.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def BlockTriangular.invertibleToBlock [LinearOrder α] [Invertible M] (hM : BlockTriangular M b)
    (k : α) : Invertible (M.toBlock (fun i => b i < k) fun i => b i < k) :=
  invertibleOfLeftInverse _ ((⅟ M).toBlock (fun i => b i < k) fun i => b i < k) <| by
    simpa only [invOf_eq_nonsing_inv] using hM.toBlock_inverse_mul_toBlock_eq_one k

/-- A lower-left subblock of the inverse of a block-triangular matrix is zero. This is a first step
towards `BlockTriangular.inv_toBlock` below. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Block/Variant91a31a99dbebef9699508f12a7f0993f07e97d5224030c604e786396b9b54acd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Block/Variant91a31a99dbebef9699508f12a7f0993f07e97d5224030c604e786396b9b54acd.lean#L336).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9b695c8102d9a3c287fab061cfeb205fe64f7b93` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
