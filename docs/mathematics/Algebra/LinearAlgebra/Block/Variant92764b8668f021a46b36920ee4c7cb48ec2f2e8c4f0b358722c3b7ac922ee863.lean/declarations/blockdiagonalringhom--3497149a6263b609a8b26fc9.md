## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:242c274b6e1595045fa1b8cd1a2953fd39716f84ebc0f541fb1171168b53f53f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 476–486.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def blockDiagonalRingHom [DecidableEq m] [Fintype o] [Fintype m] [NonAssocSemiring α] :
    (o → Matrix m m α) →+* Matrix (m × o) (m × o) α :=
  { blockDiagonalAddMonoidHom m m o α with
    toFun := blockDiagonal
    map_one' := blockDiagonal_one
    map_mul' := blockDiagonal_mul }
#align matrix.block_diagonal_ring_hom Matrix.blockDiagonalRingHom

end

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Block/Variant92764b8668f021a46b36920ee4c7cb48ec2f2e8c4f0b358722c3b7ac922ee863.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Block/Variant92764b8668f021a46b36920ee4c7cb48ec2f2e8c4f0b358722c3b7ac922ee863.lean#L476).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e13bacc1fcfba89e2af06b12f7f2c37aecfb1600` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
