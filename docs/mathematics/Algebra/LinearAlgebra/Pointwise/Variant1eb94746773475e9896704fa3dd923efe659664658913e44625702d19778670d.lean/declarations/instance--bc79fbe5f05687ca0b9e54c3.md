## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dd1e6090a478071549d6ccb856b1675918260f3c47829c3731e1e4c1c43b3e9c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 173–185.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : CanonicallyOrderedAdd (Submodule R M) where
  exists_add_of_le {_a b} h := ⟨b, (sup_eq_right.2 h).symm⟩
  le_add_self _ _ := le_sup_right
  le_self_add := fun _a _b => le_sup_left

section

variable [Monoid α] [DistribMulAction α M] [SMulCommClass α R M]

/-- The action on a submodule corresponding to applying the action to every element.

This is available as an instance in the `Pointwise` locale. -/
@[instance_reducible]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Pointwise/Variant1eb94746773475e9896704fa3dd923efe659664658913e44625702d19778670d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Pointwise/Variant1eb94746773475e9896704fa3dd923efe659664658913e44625702d19778670d.lean#L173).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4c0e8f4046ff4a124bc46256904d832dd5de355a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
