## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a514f0392853dd24da68d6ac2b4f5b6dd123c6622cd5c7e76e9880230683475e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 184–200.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : CanonicallyOrderedAddMonoid (Submodule R M) :=
  { Submodule.pointwiseAddCommMonoid,
    Submodule.completeLattice with
    zero := 0
    bot := ⊥
    add := (· + ·)
    add_le_add_left := fun _a _b => sup_le_sup_left
    exists_add_of_le := @fun _a b h => ⟨b, (sup_eq_right.2 h).symm⟩
    le_self_add := fun _a _b => le_sup_left }

section

variable [Monoid α] [DistribMulAction α M] [SMulCommClass α R M]

/-- The action on a submodule corresponding to applying the action to every element.

This is available as an instance in the `Pointwise` locale. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Pointwise/Variantfb1d508790d0c6bce2ad8a47b33e49edb16b23fbbe6152bb1015cfde678c7635.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Pointwise/Variantfb1d508790d0c6bce2ad8a47b33e49edb16b23fbbe6152bb1015cfde678c7635.lean#L184).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f8f9f6daf5da630f9380d0ab8c70ab8ce3cafc79` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
