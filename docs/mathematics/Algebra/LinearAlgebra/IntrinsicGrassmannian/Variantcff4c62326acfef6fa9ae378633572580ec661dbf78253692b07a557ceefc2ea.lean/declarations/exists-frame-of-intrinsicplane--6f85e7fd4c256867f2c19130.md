## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cea60b04-f9e1-ba2e-15fd-57c1f96f4128`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–74.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_frame_of_intrinsicPlane (P : IntrinsicPlane k n) :
    ∃ A : FullRankFrame k n, frameRowSpace A.val = P.val := by
  have hspan : Submodule.span ℝ (P.val : Set (Fin n → ℝ)) = P.val := by
    apply le_antisymm
    · exact Submodule.span_le.mpr (fun _ hx => hx)
    · intro x hx
      exact Submodule.subset_span hx
  have hfamily := Submodule.exists_fun_fin_finrank_span_eq ℝ
    (P.val : Set (Fin n → ℝ))
  rw [hspan, P.property] at hfamily
  obtain ⟨v, _, hv, _⟩ := hfamily
  let A : Matrix (Fin k) (Fin n) ℝ := Matrix.of v
  have hrow : frameRowSpace A = P.val := by
    change Submodule.span ℝ (Set.range v) = P.val
    exact hv
  have hrank : A.rank = k := by
    rw [Matrix.rank_eq_finrank_span_row]
    change Module.finrank ℝ (frameRowSpace A) = k
    rw [hrow]
    exact P.property
  exact ⟨⟨A, hrank⟩, hrow⟩

/-- Every intrinsic plane has an actual full-rank frame presentation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/IntrinsicGrassmannian/Variantcff4c62326acfef6fa9ae378633572580ec661dbf78253692b07a557ceefc2ea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/IntrinsicGrassmannian/Variantcff4c62326acfef6fa9ae378633572580ec661dbf78253692b07a557ceefc2ea.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ff2c016b4bca01700b74d77e95685cd9b21a66e5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
