## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3b35fa2f-0ba7-af40-e05b-8c4923d44aa6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 558–581.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem inv_diagonal (v : n → α) : (diagonal v)⁻¹ = diagonal (Ring.inverse v) := by
  rw [nonsing_inv_eq_ringInverse]
  by_cases h : IsUnit v
  · have := isUnit_diagonal.mpr h
    cases this.nonempty_invertible
    cases h.nonempty_invertible
    rw [Ring.inverse_invertible, Ring.inverse_invertible, invOf_diagonal_eq]
  · have := isUnit_diagonal.not.mpr h
    rw [Ring.inverse_non_unit _ h, Pi.zero_def, diagonal_zero, Ring.inverse_non_unit _ this]

end Diagonal

/-- The inverse of a 1×1 or 0×0 matrix is always diagonal.

While we could write this as `of fun _ _ => Ring.inverse (A default default)` on the RHS, this is
less useful because:

* It wouldn't work for 0×0 matrices.
* More things are true about diagonal matrices than constant matrices, and so more lemmas exist.

`Matrix.diagonal_unique` can be used to reach this form, while `Ring.inverse_eq_inv` can be used
to replace `Ring.inverse` with `⁻¹`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/NonsingularInverse/Variant8f935231c378c46e887fb68b15f8a4d3f256b3ca63056f396f3b12f1b0138b83.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/NonsingularInverse/Variant8f935231c378c46e887fb68b15f8a4d3f256b3ca63056f396f3b12f1b0138b83.lean#L558).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c902cf18353ddd4d165a05b38a5105833f73d95e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
