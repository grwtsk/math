## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:787f383cba2dd9f1a4a72374077e07b48dab477eb70f7be8bae6d0abfa0e6662`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 259–269.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance IsPoly.comp₂ {g f} [hg : IsPoly p g] [hf : IsPoly₂ p f] :
    IsPoly₂ p fun R _Rcr x y => g (f x y) := by
  obtain ⟨φ, hf⟩ := hf
  obtain ⟨ψ, hg⟩ := hg
  use fun n => bind₁ φ (ψ n)
  intros
  simp only [peval, aeval_bind₁, Function.comp, hg, hf]
#align witt_vector.is_poly.comp₂ WittVector.IsPoly.comp₂

/-- The diagonal `λ x, f x x` of a polynomial function `f` is polynomial. -/
-- Porting note: made this an instance
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/IsPoly/Variant66b2a5c3d369899a33ae0ff25fd8224f133401ff11b1d9a24518f5bcb3d3259a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/IsPoly/Variant66b2a5c3d369899a33ae0ff25fd8224f133401ff11b1d9a24518f5bcb3d3259a.lean#L259).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3acc052bd2dcfabb94505ad1e33a76fbb24123d8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
