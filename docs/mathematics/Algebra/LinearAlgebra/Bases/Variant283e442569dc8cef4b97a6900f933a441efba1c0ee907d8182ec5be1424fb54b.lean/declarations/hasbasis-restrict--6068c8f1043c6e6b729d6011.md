## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:184b18cd-8072-10a2-680a-0cf8c9c98f70`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 439–448.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem HasBasis.restrict (h : l.HasBasis p s) {q : ι → Prop}
    (hq : ∀ i, p i → ∃ j, p j ∧ q j ∧ s j ⊆ s i) : l.HasBasis (fun i => p i ∧ q i) s := by
  refine' ⟨fun t => ⟨fun ht => _, fun ⟨i, hpi, hti⟩ => h.mem_iff.2 ⟨i, hpi.1, hti⟩⟩⟩
  rcases h.mem_iff.1 ht with ⟨i, hpi, hti⟩
  rcases hq i hpi with ⟨j, hpj, hqj, hji⟩
  exact ⟨j, ⟨hpj, hqj⟩, hji.trans hti⟩
#align filter.has_basis.restrict Filter.HasBasis.restrict

/-- If `{s i | p i}` is a basis of a filter `l` and `V ∈ l`, then `{s i | p i ∧ s i ⊆ V}`
is a basis of `l`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Bases/Variant283e442569dc8cef4b97a6900f933a441efba1c0ee907d8182ec5be1424fb54b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Bases/Variant283e442569dc8cef4b97a6900f933a441efba1c0ee907d8182ec5be1424fb54b.lean#L439).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `31f2f982ee30436c03d242b91f27527f81280c15` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
