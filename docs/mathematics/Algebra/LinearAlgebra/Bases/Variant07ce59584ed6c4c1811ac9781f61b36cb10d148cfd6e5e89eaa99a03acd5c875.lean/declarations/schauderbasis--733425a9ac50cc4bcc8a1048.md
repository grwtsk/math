## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f4ffb7957de1f891b1130a2bf0ef5c141f395898d2346346ee9a874fa2a9d5b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 121–136.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev SchauderBasis (𝕜 : Type*) (X : Type*) [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜]
    [NormedAddCommGroup X] [NormedSpace 𝕜 X] :=
  GeneralSchauderBasis ℕ 𝕜 X (SummationFilter.conditional ℕ)

/--
An unconditional Schauder basis indexed by `β`.

In the literature, this is known as:
* An **Extended Basis** [Marti, Jürg T., Introduction to the theory of bases][MartiJurg1969]:
Defined via convergence of the net of finite partial sums.
* An **Unconditional Basis** [Singer, Ivan., Bases in Banach spaces][Singer_1970]: On an arbitrary
set, convergence is necessarily unconditional.

This structure generalizes the classical Schauder basis by replacing sequential
convergence with summability over the directed set of finite subsets.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Bases/Variant07ce59584ed6c4c1811ac9781f61b36cb10d148cfd6e5e89eaa99a03acd5c875.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Bases/Variant07ce59584ed6c4c1811ac9781f61b36cb10d148cfd6e5e89eaa99a03acd5c875.lean#L121).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d07fb370da9edc99f72e875de13adac15b59147c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
