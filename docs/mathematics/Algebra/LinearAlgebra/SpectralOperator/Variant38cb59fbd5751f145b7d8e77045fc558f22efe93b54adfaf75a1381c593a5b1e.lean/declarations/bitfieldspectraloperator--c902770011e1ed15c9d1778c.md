## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fb5ff644dcdf46d32fc72afbcdf75a700c3e74cdc4c19b3086d57215576ee5a5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 49–69.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure BitfieldSpectralOperator
    (system : RandomBitfieldSystem) where
  dim : Nat
  dimPositive : 0 < dim
  operator :
    Bitfield system.bits →
      Matrix (Fin dim) (Fin dim) ℂ
  selfAdjoint :
    ∀ state,
      (operator state).IsHermitian
  involution :
    Matrix (Fin dim) (Fin dim) ℂ
  involutionSquared :
    involution * involution = 1
  involutionUnitary :
    involutionᴴ * involution = 1
  functionalSymmetry :
    ∀ state,
      involution * operator state * involution =
        -operator (system.phase state)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SpectralOperator/Variant38cb59fbd5751f145b7d8e77045fc558f22efe93b54adfaf75a1381c593a5b1e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SpectralOperator/Variant38cb59fbd5751f145b7d8e77045fc558f22efe93b54adfaf75a1381c593a5b1e.lean#L49).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6ce081495ce84f018bbc93e30f8511df8ce3b237` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
