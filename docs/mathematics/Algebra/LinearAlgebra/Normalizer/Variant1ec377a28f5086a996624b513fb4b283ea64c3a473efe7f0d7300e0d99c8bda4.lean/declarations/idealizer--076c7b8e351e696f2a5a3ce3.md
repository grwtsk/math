## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0f165fbcfefac48962f73392b638ba024bd4b514839d225a3d515e34db0afa44`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 104–111.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def idealizer : LieIdeal R L where
  carrier := {x : L | ∀ m : M, ⁅x, m⁆ ∈ N}
  add_mem' := fun {x} {y} hx hy m ↦ by rw [add_lie]; exact N.add_mem (hx m) (hy m)
  zero_mem' := by simp
  smul_mem' := fun t {x} hx m ↦ by rw [smul_lie]; exact N.smul_mem t (hx m)
  lie_mem := fun {x} {y} hy m ↦ by rw [lie_lie]; exact sub_mem (N.lie_mem (hy m)) (hy ⁅x, m⁆)

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Normalizer/Variant1ec377a28f5086a996624b513fb4b283ea64c3a473efe7f0d7300e0d99c8bda4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Normalizer/Variant1ec377a28f5086a996624b513fb4b283ea64c3a473efe7f0d7300e0d99c8bda4.lean#L104).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f1b67066f583934d52290c38a6e88e9c2970d536` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
