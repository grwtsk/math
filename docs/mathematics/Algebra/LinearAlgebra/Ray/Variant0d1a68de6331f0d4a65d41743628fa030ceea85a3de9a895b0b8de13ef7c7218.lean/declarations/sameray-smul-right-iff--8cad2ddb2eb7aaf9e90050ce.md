## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4a86d2c5-16ca-17c5-a22d-24fd1704ad7f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 467–472.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sameRay_smul_right_iff {v : M} {r : R} : SameRay R v (r • v) ↔ 0 ≤ r ∨ v = 0 :=
  ⟨fun hrv => or_iff_not_imp_left.2 fun hr => eq_zero_of_sameRay_neg_smul_right (not_le.1 hr) hrv,
    or_imp.2 ⟨SameRay.sameRay_nonneg_smul_right v, fun h => h.symm ▸ SameRay.zero_left _⟩⟩

/-- A nonzero vector is in the same ray as a multiple of itself if and only if that multiple
is positive. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Ray/Variant0d1a68de6331f0d4a65d41743628fa030ceea85a3de9a895b0b8de13ef7c7218.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Ray/Variant0d1a68de6331f0d4a65d41743628fa030ceea85a3de9a895b0b8de13ef7c7218.lean#L467).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `90551029795c1169e59e3a09ff84c1d458a29155` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
