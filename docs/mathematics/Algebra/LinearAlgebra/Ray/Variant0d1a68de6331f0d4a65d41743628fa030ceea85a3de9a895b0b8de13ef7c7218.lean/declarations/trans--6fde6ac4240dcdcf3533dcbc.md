## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d446bb01-a0b8-f367-7caa-71ac4f33ffcc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 102–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem trans (hxy : SameRay R x y) (hyz : SameRay R y z) (hy : y = 0 → x = 0 ∨ z = 0) :
    SameRay R x z := by
  rcases eq_or_ne x 0 with (rfl | hx); · exact zero_left z
  rcases eq_or_ne z 0 with (rfl | hz); · exact zero_right x
  rcases eq_or_ne y 0 with (rfl | hy)
  · exact (hy rfl).elim (fun h => (hx h).elim) fun h => (hz h).elim
  rcases hxy.exists_pos hx hy with ⟨r₁, r₂, hr₁, hr₂, h₁⟩
  rcases hyz.exists_pos hy hz with ⟨r₃, r₄, hr₃, hr₄, h₂⟩
  refine Or.inr (Or.inr <| ⟨r₃ * r₁, r₂ * r₄, mul_pos hr₃ hr₁, mul_pos hr₂ hr₄, ?_⟩)

  [IsScalarTower S R M] {a : S}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Ray/Variant0d1a68de6331f0d4a65d41743628fa030ceea85a3de9a895b0b8de13ef7c7218.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Ray/Variant0d1a68de6331f0d4a65d41743628fa030ceea85a3de9a895b0b8de13ef7c7218.lean#L102).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `90551029795c1169e59e3a09ff84c1d458a29155` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
