## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:15289db54778cf2fb97411d9b789e7ddf5d83550362cc12e786c8a47b726c005`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 195–204.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def restrictScalars₁₂ (B : M →ₗ[R] N →ₗ[S] Pₗ) : M →ₗ[R'] N →ₗ[S'] Pₗ :=
  LinearMap.mk₂' R' S'
    (B · ·)
    B.map_add₂
    (fun r' m _ ↦ by
      dsimp only
      rw [← smul_one_smul R r' m, map_smul₂, smul_one_smul])
    (fun _ ↦ map_add _)
    (fun _ x ↦ (B x).map_smul_of_tower _)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/BilinearMap/Variant2ef3c059d71878fd65a28badf479063525eb6159c443c8bc0a2cafed848d2bbd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/BilinearMap/Variant2ef3c059d71878fd65a28badf479063525eb6159c443c8bc0a2cafed848d2bbd.lean#L195).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fc9dac722c29995805887b1f0e2c2f6068bb2eda` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
