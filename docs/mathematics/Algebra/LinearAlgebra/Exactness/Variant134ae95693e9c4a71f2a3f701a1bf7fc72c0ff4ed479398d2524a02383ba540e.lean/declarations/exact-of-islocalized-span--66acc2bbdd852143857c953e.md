## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e8a9556b-3e5e-6e0e-57f0-0eedc6bf66a7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 160–181.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma exact_of_isLocalized_span (H : ∀ r : s, Function.Exact
    (map (.powers r.1) (f r) (g r) F) (map (.powers r.1) (g r) (h r) G)) :
    Function.Exact F G := by
  simp only [LinearMap.exact_iff] at H ⊢
  apply Submodule.eq_of_isLocalized₀_span s spn Nₚ g
  intro r
  rw [← LinearMap.range_localizedMap_eq_localized₀_range _ (f r) (g r) F]
  rw [← LinearMap.ker_localizedMap_eq_localized₀_ker (.powers r.1) (g r) (h r) G]
  have := SetLike.ext_iff.mp <| H r
  ext x
  simp only [mem_range, mem_ker] at this ⊢
  exact this x

end isLocalized_span

  [AddCommMonoid N] [Module R N] [AddCommMonoid L] [Module R L]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Exactness/Variant134ae95693e9c4a71f2a3f701a1bf7fc72c0ff4ed479398d2524a02383ba540e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Exactness/Variant134ae95693e9c4a71f2a3f701a1bf7fc72c0ff4ed479398d2524a02383ba540e.lean#L160).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ce0f98bd21ab78872379a3e055ffe41c6ed69368` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
