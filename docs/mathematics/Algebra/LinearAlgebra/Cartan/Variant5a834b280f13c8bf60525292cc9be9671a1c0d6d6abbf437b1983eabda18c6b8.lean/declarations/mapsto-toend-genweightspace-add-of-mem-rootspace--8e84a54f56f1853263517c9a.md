## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:916d79c0-b0f1-3ee0-ee97-2093610d6581`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 135–144.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mapsTo_toEnd_genWeightSpace_add_of_mem_rootSpace (α χ : H → R)
    {x : L} (hx : x ∈ rootSpace H α) :
    MapsTo (toEnd R L M x) (genWeightSpace M χ) (genWeightSpace M (α + χ)) := by
  intro m hm
  let x' : rootSpace H α := ⟨x, hx⟩
  let m' : genWeightSpace M χ := ⟨m, hm⟩
  exact (rootSpaceWeightSpaceProduct R L H M α χ (α + χ) rfl (x' ⊗ₜ m')).property

/-- Given a nilpotent Lie subalgebra `H ⊆ L` together with `χ₁ χ₂ : H → R`, there is a natural
`R`-bilinear product of root vectors, compatible with the actions of `H`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Cartan/Variant5a834b280f13c8bf60525292cc9be9671a1c0d6d6abbf437b1983eabda18c6b8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Cartan/Variant5a834b280f13c8bf60525292cc9be9671a1c0d6d6abbf437b1983eabda18c6b8.lean#L135).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0da93c2b77d7de2390e0f789d23483c7dc4599a5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
