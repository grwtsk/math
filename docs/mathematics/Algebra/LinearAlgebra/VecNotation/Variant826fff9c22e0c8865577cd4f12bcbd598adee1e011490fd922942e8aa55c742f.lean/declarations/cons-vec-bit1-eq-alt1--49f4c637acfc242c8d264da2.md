## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7e8434e0-4120-0ce5-948e-d0a12db1e502`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 390–396.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cons_vec_bit1_eq_alt1 (x : α) (u : Fin n → α) (i : Fin (n + 1)) :
    vecCons x u ((i + i) + 1) = vecAlt1 rfl (vecAppend rfl (vecCons x u) (vecCons x u)) i := by
  rw [vecAlt1_vecAppend]; rfl

end bits

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/VecNotation/Variant826fff9c22e0c8865577cd4f12bcbd598adee1e011490fd922942e8aa55c742f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/VecNotation/Variant826fff9c22e0c8865577cd4f12bcbd598adee1e011490fd922942e8aa55c742f.lean#L390).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1ffc3ff2cbea383e55ad6a2d352503a3cf50cd39` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
