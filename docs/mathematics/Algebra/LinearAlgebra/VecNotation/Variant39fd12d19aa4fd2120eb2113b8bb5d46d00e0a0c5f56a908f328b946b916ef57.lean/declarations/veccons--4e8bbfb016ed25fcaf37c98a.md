## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d328cafbca0b948b2699b00bd2479cbaf82e85e6b930563be41132e6d24df1d6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–65.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def vecCons {n : ℕ} (h : α) (t : Fin n → α) : Fin n.succ → α :=
  Fin.cons h t

/-- `![...]` notation is used to construct a vector `Fin n → α` using `Matrix.vecEmpty` and
`Matrix.vecCons`.

For instance, `![a, b, c] : Fin 3` is syntax for `vecCons a (vecCons b (vecCons c vecEmpty))`.

Note that this should not be used as syntax for `Matrix` as it generates a term with the wrong type.
The `!![a, b; c, d]` syntax (provided by `Matrix.matrixNotation`) should be used instead.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/VecNotation/Variant39fd12d19aa4fd2120eb2113b8bb5d46d00e0a0c5f56a908f328b946b916ef57.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/VecNotation/Variant39fd12d19aa4fd2120eb2113b8bb5d46d00e0a0c5f56a908f328b946b916ef57.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d7aedbdea64e7cdf5493b612f1c735ea62cea293` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
