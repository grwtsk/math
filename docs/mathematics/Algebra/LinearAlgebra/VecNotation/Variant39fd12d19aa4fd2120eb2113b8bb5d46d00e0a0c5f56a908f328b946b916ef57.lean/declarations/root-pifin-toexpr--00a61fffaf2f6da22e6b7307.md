## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a52a3a23662f9b736f8ce43b45a28c056b56cae83ae777d4c8e27d2d563be68c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 269–291.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected instance _root_.PiFin.toExpr [ToLevel.{u}] [ToExpr α] (n : ℕ) : ToExpr (Fin n → α) :=
  have lu := toLevel.{u}
  have eα : Q(Type $lu) := toTypeExpr α
  let toTypeExpr := q(Fin $n → $eα)
  { toTypeExpr, toExpr v := PiFin.mkLiteralQ fun i => show Q($eα) from toExpr (v i) }

/-! ### `bit0` and `bit1` indices
The following definitions and `simp` lemmas are used to allow
numeral-indexed element of a vector given with matrix notation to
be extracted by `simp` in Lean 3 (even when the numeral is larger than the
number of elements in the vector, which is taken modulo that number
of elements by virtue of the semantics of `bit0` and `bit1` and of
addition on `Fin n`).
-/


/-- `vecAppend ho u v` appends two vectors of lengths `m` and `n` to produce
one of length `o = m + n`. This is a variant of `Fin.append` with an additional `ho` argument,
which provides control of definitional equality for the vector length.

This turns out to be helpful when providing simp lemmas to reduce `![a, b, c] n`, and also means
that `vecAppend ho u v 0` is valid. `Fin.append u v 0` is not valid in this case because there is
no `Zero (Fin (m + n))` instance. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/VecNotation/Variant39fd12d19aa4fd2120eb2113b8bb5d46d00e0a0c5f56a908f328b946b916ef57.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/VecNotation/Variant39fd12d19aa4fd2120eb2113b8bb5d46d00e0a0c5f56a908f328b946b916ef57.lean#L269).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d7aedbdea64e7cdf5493b612f1c735ea62cea293` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
