## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:969e355a44608dc96bbc815b0ceff40c3275f705d9fdaad04160c2ca9b46e743`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 269–272.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def vecAppend {α : Type*} {o : ℕ} (ho : o = m + n) (u : Fin m → α) (v : Fin n → α) : Fin o → α :=
  Fin.append u v ∘ Fin.castIso ho
#align matrix.vec_append Matrix.vecAppend

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/VecNotation/Variant33bc1e7bc568ee1789fa9782316ff5b01d33bb488e764c86e16be714c7c5d979.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/VecNotation/Variant33bc1e7bc568ee1789fa9782316ff5b01d33bb488e764c86e16be714c7c5d979.lean#L269).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `235ee4351dd3b285928c42c2ac75a6317901333f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
