## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:466ec12618f919e44913d5e6ffe4cb6c6423cc20a14483ad1d0e67e47eea9a4a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 396–413.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def piOptionEquivProd {ι : Type*} {M : Option ι → Type*} [(i : Option ι) → AddCommGroup (M i)]
    [(i : Option ι) → Module R (M i)] :
    ((i : Option ι) → M i) ≃ₗ[R] M none × ((i : ι) → M (some i)) :=
  { Equiv.piOptionEquivProd with
    map_add' := by simp [Function.funext_iff]
    map_smul' := by simp [Function.funext_iff] }
#align linear_equiv.pi_option_equiv_prod LinearEquiv.piOptionEquivProd

variable (ι M) (S : Type*) [Fintype ι] [DecidableEq ι] [Semiring S] [AddCommMonoid M]
  [Module R M] [Module S M] [SMulCommClass R S M]

/-- Linear equivalence between linear functions `Rⁿ → M` and `Mⁿ`. The spaces `Rⁿ` and `Mⁿ`
are represented as `ι → R` and `ι → M`, respectively, where `ι` is a finite type.

This as an `S`-linear equivalence, under the assumption that `S` acts on `M` commuting with `R`.
When `R` is commutative, we can take this to be the usual action with `S = R`.
Otherwise, `S = ℕ` shows that the equivalence is additive.
See note [bundled maps over different rings]. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Pi/Variantc2d7bc68d5f8c2b2e53581db87d11c34806ef62b5b418d9e9725b76281c1a985.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Pi/Variantc2d7bc68d5f8c2b2e53581db87d11c34806ef62b5b418d9e9725b76281c1a985.lean#L396).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `52128bab340b154d9f91dfaaef47e6c5d5dc67ab` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
