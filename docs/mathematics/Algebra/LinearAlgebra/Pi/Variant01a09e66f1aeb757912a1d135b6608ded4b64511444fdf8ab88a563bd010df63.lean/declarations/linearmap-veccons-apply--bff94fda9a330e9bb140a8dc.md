## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:99da4fde-711e-5a3a-a75e-6b82f5506c7f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 644–661.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem LinearMap.vecCons_apply {n} (f : M →ₗ[R] M₂) (g : M →ₗ[R] Fin n → M₂) (m : M) :
    f.vecCons g m = Matrix.vecCons (f m) (g m) :=
  rfl

variable (R) in
/--
To show a property `motive` of modules holds for arbitrary finite products of modules, it suffices
to show
1. `motive` is stable under isomorphism.
2. `motive` holds for the zero module.
3. `motive` holds for `M × N` if it holds for both `M` and `N`.

Since we need to apply `motive` to modules in `Type u` and in `Type (max u v)`, there is a second
`motive'` argument which is required to be equivalent to `motive` up to universe lifting by `equiv`.

See `Module.pi_induction'` for a version where `motive` assumes `AddCommGroup` instead.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Pi/Variant01a09e66f1aeb757912a1d135b6608ded4b64511444fdf8ab88a563bd010df63.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Pi/Variant01a09e66f1aeb757912a1d135b6608ded4b64511444fdf8ab88a563bd010df63.lean#L644).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e60bf5fb2621cad6e6988bde409a14016462c3b9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
